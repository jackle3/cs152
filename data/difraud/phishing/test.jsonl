KMEX -- UNIVISION LOS ANGELES WATCH HERE UNIVISION \u2013 UNIVISION LOS ANGELES WATCH HERE Media's Trump Coverage 'Needs to Be Balanced' In General Election, Says DNC Chair VARIETY \/\/ TED JOHNSON Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that she expects that the \"outrageously imbalanced\" news media coverage of Donald Trump will \"begin to even out\" as the race heads to the general election. In an interview with Variety on Wednesday, Wasserman Schultz said that the general election will present a different dynamic because it will be a head-to-head matchup, versus the GOP primary when Trump dominated coverage against 16 other opponents. She said that the DNC \"will be pushing for accountability when it comes to the media's coverage of this campaign from our perspective. The opportunities should be essentially even, and so it is my hope and our expectation that the coverage would begin to even out, and you not allow what they allowed to play out during the primary. And I expect that they will be more responsible about it than they have.\" Analytics firm MediaQuant valued Trump's earned media coverage at $2.8 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for Hillary Clinton, $770.7 million for Ted Cruz and $658 million for Bernie Sanders. The figures are for 12 months ended April 30. The Trump coverage, she said, has \"kind of been outrageously imbalanced.\" Still, Wasserman Schultz said that it was \"not for us to dictate\" whether news networks conduct phone interviews with Trump, as opposed to in-studio or on camera interviews. Clinton has conducted phoners too, but news networks have been criticized for the extent to which they have featured Trump by audio only. \"I am just talking about the coverage needs to be balanced, and they can't just focus on ratings, and they need to focus on making sure that they present a fair opportunity that is presented to them without being mindful that there is a candidate on the other side,\" she said. Wasserman Schultz was at the headquarters of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, the day after Trump trounced Cruz in the Indiana primary and Cruz dropped out. Trump's remaining rival, John Kasich, abandoned his bid on Wednesday, making Trump the presumptive nominee. Wasserman Schultz called Trump an \"abomination.\" \"Donald Trump is the Republican party,\" Wasserman Schultz said. \"\u2026So any comparison of Donald Trump being able to vanquish his opponents in the primary to he general election are really completely comparing apples and oranges. Donald Trump's success has proven that this is where the Republican party of today is. They are right wing and extreme. They support misogyny. They are willing to support the most bigoted, sexist, misogynistic bully that has campaigned for the presidency in modern times. And that certainly is not where a majority of Americans are.\" Still, she said that she agrees with pundits and analysts who say that Trump should not be underestimated. \"We are a divided nation,\" she said. \"We are going to take this election very seriously, unlike Republicans, who laughed Donald Trump off for far too long. We have been assuming for many months that he would be their nominee, have been preparing for him to be their nominee, and we will be running this election as if it were a down-to-the-wire close election.\" The race between Clinton and Sanders has gotten heated, while the expectation had been that the Democrats would wrap up their primary race before the Republicans did. Instead, Sanders won Indiana's primary, although it didn't put much of a dent in Clinton's delegate lead. Wasserman Schultz said that she was \"confident\" of party unity. \"On our side, compared to 2008, this is a relatively tame back and forth,\" Wasserman Schultz said. \"Go back and watch some of the acrimony between Obama and Clinton at this point. The election was much closer, and you had a lot more acrimony. Surrogates were on TV trashing the other. And not only did we reunify even though it played out through the primaries, President Obama eventually asked Senator Clinton to be his secretary of state.\" Wasserman Schultz said that she has \"cautioned the candidates at this stage of the campaign to be mindful of tone,\" but she also noted that each candidate has vowed to support the other in the general election. Instead, she said that it is Republicans who \"have a real problem with unity\" based on sentiments expressed by some conservatives on social media who say they will never back Trump. She said that they would be reaching out to Republicans to support the Democratic nominee. \"There are a number coming out publicly on their own,\" she said. \"We always do, but we see many more than usual on the Republican side who are actually saying they will not only go to the polls and vote for our candidate but will be willing to work for our candidate.\" She predicted that there will be more voter interest in the Democratic National Convention than the Republican gathering, which she said is \"going to be a circus.\" \"They are about to nominate the most extreme, racist, sexist, bigoted, misogynist in modern times,\" she said. \"So watching their convention play out will be more like watching a train wreck. You shouldn't do it, but you can't help yourself.\" She added, \"If you look comparatively at 2012, the Republican National Convention, with a so-called establishment nominee, ended with Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair.\" She said that this years DNC \"will be such a clear and stark contrast about the choice that voters will have in being able to move us forward and focus on the future or be dragged backwards and worse.\" Wasserman Schultz said that she expected the electoral map to look like it did in 2012, although she pointed to demographic shifts and expected turnout from voters alarmed at the prospect of Trump being elected. Although California is reliably blue, she pointed to 14,000 new Democrats registered in Orange County, a traditional conservative bastion. \"They are generating interest on our side simply because of how badly [the Republicans] are alienating large groups of voters,\" she said. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders bring Democratic battle to California LA DAILY NEWS \/\/ DAVID MONTERO Welcome to what battleground state status feels like, California Democrats. At least for a little while. Just hours after Indiana sent Sen. Ted Cruz packing and Ohio Gov. John Kasich called it quits, essentially making Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee for president, the Democrats found they were the ones in the middle of the political drama, with their front-runner being chased by a challenger who not only won in the Hoosier State but has vowed to keep fighting through California's June 7 primary. Bernie Sanders may be a mathematical long shot to get the Democratic presidential nomination, despite winning the Indiana primary Tuesday, but Hillary Clinton isn't taking chances and has begun flooding California with rallies, office openings and fundraisers. The tussle between Clinton and Sanders for the state's 475 delegates started in earnest today, as early primary voting gets underway Monday. Former President Bill Clinton spoke in Los Angeles on behalf of his wife at the Grand Suite Hotel on Wednesday before participating in a panel discussion about gun violence with members of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and actor Brad Pitt in the evening. His appearances in Southern California also included a speech in San Diego. The former president is also participating in a fundraiser this week and will deliver the commencement speech for undergraduates at Loyola Marymont University on Saturday. Meanwhile, Sanders had surrogates speaking for him at UC Irvine and Cal State Long Beach on Wednesday, a move that played to his popularity among college-age millennials. He went Hollywood with the move, tapping actors Kendrick Sampson of \"How to Get Away With Murder,\" Heather Matarazzo of \"The Princess Diaries\" and Oscar winner Susan Sarandon. Coming into Los Angeles on Wednesday to see the Golden State shuffle was Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who said she preferred her position of watching two of her party's candidates duel for the nomination rather than the task facing her Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus. \"I've never seen so much churn and angst and opposition to the presumptive nominee from a political party like what is taking place here,\" she said in an interview at the Los Angeles County Democratic Party headquarters. \"You know they have a massive problem on their hands.\" When Cruz and Kasich dropped out, some Republicans posted photos of themselves burning their voter registration cards or switching to independent, unaffiliated or Libertarian parties. Priebus on Twitter urged Republicans to \"unite and focus on defeating (Hillary) Clinton.\" Wasserman Shultz said the campaign has been \"substantive\" on the Democratic side but acknowledged it's also gotten stickier as the primary season wears on. \"They're in the narrow end of the funnel right now, and so it's been a bit more intense towards the end here,\" she said. \"The reality is that our voters are coming out of primaries saying that the primaries energized them and made them more enthusiastic about supporting either one of our candidates.\" Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders in delegates and is just a few hundred short of securing the presidential nomination in Philadelphia this summer, although the Sanders campaign hopes to persuade some superdelegates to switch sides. In California alone, of the state's 73 superdelegates, more than 50 have already committed to Clinton. Sanders has suggested superdelegates who come from states he won should flip their votes to him. Wasserman Shultz said after the 2008 election \"it's a completely reasonable and fair process\" and the 712 superdelegates are a small fraction of the 4,763 total delegates going to the convention in Philadelphia this summer. She also said superdelegates \u2014 in place since 1984 \u2014 have never determined the nominee. \"We separate those 712 unpledged delegates and give them an opportunity to vote for who they want to because they are party leaders and elected officials and people who have been in the trenches to help build the party,\" she said. -- Walter Garcia Western Regional Press Secretary Democratic National Committee (DNC) Email: GarciaW@dnc.org Twitter: @WalterGarcia231","label":0}

{"text":"Great \u2013 Jenna\/Rachel, pls blast out Subject line: New report: Trump's reckless trade policies would cost families $2,200\/year Body: Makes sense, since Trump thinks wages are \"too high \" in the U.S. Trump's tariffs will cost Americans thousands, report says Tami Lubhy \/ CNN Donald Trump's tough talk of imposing tariffs on China, Japan and Mexico gets big cheers at his rallies. What his supporters may not realize, however, is how much those tariffs will cost them. Trump has repeatedly said America has been on the losing end of trade deals for years. In his view, the tariffs would level the playing field by making imports more expensive. That, in turn, would prompt American companies to produce more domestically and bring back jobs. Experts, however, say boosting tariffs would be a bad deal for Americans, particularly for the poor. The tariffs would cost the average household $2,200 a year, or 4% of their after-tax income, according to a new study from the non-profit National Foundation for American Policy conducted by David Tuerck, Paul Bachman and Frank Conte, all of Suffolk University. This is largely because imports under Trump's policy would become more expensive, sending the price of competing American-made goods higher as well. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers. \"All of the benefits for producers would be extracted from consumers,\" said Tuerck, who heads the economics department at Suffolk. \"It's using a blunt sword to do brain surgery. It would cost consumers an awful lot for rather small benefits for U.S. producers.\" The levy would fall even more heavily on the poor since they spend more on necessities and more of their purchases are low-cost imported goods, experts say. The tariffs would eat up 18%, or $934, of the annual income of those in the bottom 10% of households. But they would only dent the income of the richest decile by 3%, or $5,001, the researchers estimated. The Suffolk University study assumes Trump would levy a 45% tariff on goods and services from China and Japan and 35% on Mexican products. The presumptive Republican candidate has not laid out a specific trade policy, but has talked of implementing such tariffs. Trump's campaign did not return a request for comment. What's more, broad-based tariffs on imports from these countries could wind up hurting globally competitive American companies , particularly ones in higher-skilled industries that pay better wages. If the U.S. cuts down on buying imports, foreign countries may have less money to buy U.S. exports or they may retaliate by imposing their own levies on U.S. goods, said Peter Petri, professor of international economics at Brandeis University. That will hurt makers of more advanced products, such as pharmaceuticals, computer chips and chemicals, while protecting lower-wage manufacturers, such as garment and toy companies. But even if the makers of these commodity products were to set up shop again in the U.S., they likely would be highly automated and not create many jobs. \"It would increase jobs not done in America today because they pay too little, but decrease export-oriented jobs with higher wages,\" said Petri, noting that globally competitive exporters pay up to 18% more, on average, than those that don't export. \"We'll put shackles on our most competitive industries.\"","label":0}

{"text":"Today in the call for a full, nine bench Supreme Court: Senate Democrats join environmental advocates to discuss importance of filling the Supreme Court vacancy, Florida Republican Senate candidate David Jolly calls for Garland nomination hearing and a vote, while editorial boards and political analysts continue to note the poisonous political game Senate Republicans are playing over Chief Judge Garland's nomination. Senate Democrats And Environmental Advocates Call On Republican Senators: #DoYourJob Today, Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Brian Schatz, Senator Martin Heinrich and Senator Ed Markey joined NextGen Climate, Green for All, League for Conservation Voters and Clean Water Action on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court with a clear demand for Senate Republicans: do your job by giving President Obama's Supreme Court nominee full and fair consideration. A video of the event can be found here . Sen. Boxer (D-CA): \"We cannot afford to have a deadlocked court, which could lead to different rules in different parts of the country and inconsistent protections for public health and the environment.\" Sen. Heinrich (D-NM): \"Challenges to the President's Clean Power Plan will ultimately end up being heard before the U.S. Supreme Court. This is precisely the type of case that the American people cannot have end in a 4-4 tie. It is my sincere hope that Republicans will end their obstructionism and take their jobs and constitutional duties seriously.\" Sen. Schatz (D-HI): It's time for Senate Republicans to end the political games, fulfill their constitutional duty, and join us in restoring the Supreme Court to its full strength.\" Sen. Markey (D-MA): \"Landmark rulings on the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act explain why just one vacancy on this Supreme Court has such enormous impact and why the stakes are so high. We simply cannot afford to have a vacancy on the Supreme Court for the sake of environmental and climate protections.\" [NextGen Press Release, 04\/26\/16 ] GOP Senate candidate: Chief Judge Merrick Garland deserves a vote. During a debate last night, Rep. David Jolly (R-FL), who is currently running for the Florida Senate seat, said that he supports hearings and a vote for Chief Judge Garland. Rep. David Jolly: \"I do think he should have a hearing and I would like to see a vote...That's actually the proper exercise of the Senate's Article I authority.\" [Huffington Post, 04\/26\/16 ] Sen. Leahy calls Republican obstruction not a \"history the Senate should be proud of.\" Speaking at the Kennedy Institute, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) invoked the legacy of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), during whose tenure no pending Supreme Court nominee was denied a hearing and a vote. Sen. Leahy: \"These days, we certainly could use some more of Senator Kennedy's commitment to the Constitution,...[Senator Kennedy] understood the momentous nature of Supreme Court nominations, as well as the historic and constitutionally-mandated role of the Senate....To deny Chief Judge Garland a public hearing and a vote would be truly historic - but that is not the kind of history the Senate should be proud of.\" [Senator Leahy Press Release, 04\/16\/16 ] Salt Lake Tribune: Hatch should reciprocate and consider Garland nomination for Supreme Court. The editorial board of the Salt Lake Tribune urges Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to give Chief Judge Garland's nomination the same consideration President Obama gave Ronald G. Russell, who is now awaiting Senate action on his nomination to the U.S. District Court for Utah. \"But Utah's elder statesman has two good reasons to break from the pack, stop the partisan melodrama and show leadership, to spend some of the political capital that he has accumulated over four decades. Merrick Garland and Ronald G. Russell are nominees he admires. Instead of contributing to poisonous politics, he could actually do something to fix it, something to loosen the appointment logjam and help courts function the way they are intended....Obama acted on your choice to fill a federal judgeship in Utah. You should reciprocate. It is what Utahns elected you to do.\" Republican Senators can blame McConnell for \"forcing them to carry the albatross of Garland obstructionism around their necks.\" Juan Williams, a FOX News policy analyst, writes in the Hill that poll after poll shows that Senate Republicans are on the wrong side of the Supreme Court nomination debate. \"Yes, blocking a nominee from Obama will appeal to the hard-right base of the GOP. But McConnell's most vulnerable Senate incumbents come from states that Obama won in 2012...McConnell's blunt refusal to consider Garland fits with the image of the broken, dysfunctional Republican Party that is forcing Senate candidates to run away from its nominating convention.\" [The Hill, 04\/26\/16 ] Illinois City Council passes resolution urging Senate to hold hearings and a vote for Chief Judge Garland. The Daily Northwestern reports: Evanston Mayor Elizabeth Tisdahl: \"[The Supreme Court] certainly does impact us. It'd be nice to have gun control decisions come from the Supreme Court and it would certainly make a big difference in the city of Evanston. ... The Supreme Court now is ending up in 4-4 ties.\" Councilmember Donald Wilson: \"If other aspects of the government is not doing their jobs, it directly impacts us...It's our expectation that our representatives do their jobs as they're supposed to do. We're not asking for a specific result we are just asking that people do their jobs.\" Toledo officials tell Sen. Portman to do his job. According to the Toledo Blade : \"Today outside the Lucas County Courthouse, Toledo Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson and Lucas County commissioners Carol Contrada and Pete Gerken - all Democrats - blasted Republicans in the United State Senate for failing to move on President Obama's Supreme Court nomination of federal appeals judge Merrick Garland.\" Lucas County commissioner Pete Gerken: \"I'm demanding Senate Republicans do their job...Senator Portman, your job is clear.

I will also have picture forms available for everyone to fill out and pictures are scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 9 at 1:00 PM. (Need to be ready to go at 12:45 at Pershing Middle School.) I would like for the forms to be returned at the game on Friday evening so I can fill out the order form for the team before Sunday. The first game for the Tornados will be held this Friday at 6:30 PM Field 6 (be there at 6:15 for warm-up) I will also have a signup sheet for snacks after the games if everyone thinks we want to do this. Let me know if there is a question. Thanks.

{"text":"Marco, Alex, great job and thanks for the update. Have a safe trip. Marco Bettini Sent from my iPad Il giorno 23\/gen\/2013, alle ore 18:47, Marco Catino < m.catino@hackingteam.com > ha scritto: Hello, in the last two days we met two prospects: San Bernardino Sheriff Department and R.E.A.C.T. San Bernardino Sheriff Department (SS8) Five people from the Sheriff Department were at the presentation, of which at least one seemed to be a very technical guy. This was the first contact with RCS for them, so we went through a standard presentation with Alex. Everything went very smooth, and they seemed quite impressed of the power of the product. Quite a big amount of time was spent talking about the scenarios that they could use RCS for, and we shared some of our ideas and experience with them. In particular, there is one scenario that they really care about: how to infect a Blackberry when the phone is on a BES with very strict security policies and the users only exchange PGP encrypted messages. These people have their BES setup through services offered by Phantom Express: I'll look it up and try to see if I can come up with something that we can share with the Prospect. REACT REACT is a task force that includes different agencies; in my understanding, they are mainly focused on \"online crimes\" (meaning identity theft, online frauds, pedopronography, ...) and they run a big wiretap room. It was interesting how one of the persons who organized the meeting was saying how good it would be to take some of the money spent on wiretapping and move it to a solution like ours: it looks like they do have the budget. At the meeting were about 15 people, all at the first contact with RCS. Usual presentation and Demo, only a small technical issue that apparently nobody noticed. Thanks a lot Alex for covering me while I was fixing it!! There weren't many questions, maybe because nobody wanted to expose herself too much in front of other agencies, but all questions were answered. After the demo, we got to spend some time talking to the DA (District Attorney), who was totally impressed by the product and kept coming up with different ways they could use it. We are now headed to Bogota, where we will meet two Prospects in the next two days. I'll keep you updated. Ciao, M. PS: Alex just updated me that the meetings in Bogota might be three.

{"text":"This has been a tough couple of weeks. I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company. Here's a rundown of events from last week: We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas. - The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us. Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2. Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB. Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-. All agency ratings are investment grade. Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that: EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday. Transaction counts remain higher than average. EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas. EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi. EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities. Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question. We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole. We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company. And that's where you come in. Look around you. Look at the excellence that you and your team represents. That's the reason we hired you - you're the best. Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other. Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.","label":0}

A friend of mine is in college here at NDSU. In one of his classes, the subject of National Socialism comes up regularly and Shawn is able to counter the bullshit mostly with information I have imparted to him. When asked where had gotten his information, he usually responds \"My friend Bill, he's a National Socialist..\" Well aparently yesterday the professor said that there are no groups currently in the US that openly follow Hitler. (A college professor is that ignorant?) Anyway when Shawn told her that was wrong, she challenged him to name one group.... So it has come to my attention that the professor is actually considering asking me to address her class in the near future. Kind of a Q and A situation I would imagine. I am certainly up for it, but thought I should clear it with HQ first. It is something I can handle with no problem, and I would actually kind of enjoy it.

{"text":"ST 1st Class Herring, NS greetings, glad you liked my statement. I meant every word of it, I am tired of 1\/2 hearted losers and drama queens, this fight is real for me, and the weak hearted need to get out of the way. Yes, I know about the importance of Oaths, that is why I addressed it, it is very important to me, and should be to every single NS in the World. In regards to the trip, I do hope you can ride along with me, at this point it might just be you and I going from here, the other guys here either can't get of work or don't have any $ to go, and the unit Leader is having back surgery. I can't imagine you would need more than $350. for the trip, that should be more than enough (I don't think I will have any more than that myself). Plus you can always split the cost of a motel room with someone, or several people the 2 nights we are in Milwaukee. Worse case scenario, if you are running out of $$$, I can cover the gas, I have to be there anyways, so don't worry about it, the main thing is to be there, and if you are in a pinch, I am always willing to help a Brother. If its just us 2 going, I will probably end up driving my own car, if another person wants to go, we will have to rent a small car, my back seat is only small enough for children (lol). I will let you know about motels when you figure out where the bus is dropping you off. If it comes down to St. Paul, MPLS, or Hutchinson, Hutchinson motels will be a little cheaper. If you are going to the City I suggest St. Paul bus stop not MPLS, due to the bridge collapse MPLS is a pain in the ass and will slow us down. St. Pauls bus stop is right on University Ave I think, so that works too. I would put you up here at our place, but with 6 children, and a very pissed off woman, and not much extra space, its probably not a good plan (ha ha). I am very impressed by your dedication, and devotion to our cause, and look forward to talking with you on the trip about the job the Party has in mind for you, and just general Comeraderie. 88 Commander Schoep On 10\/16\/07, William Herring wrote: > > > This needed to be said.

{"text":"Anders, Sending again. Your server rejected this because of the extensions so changed them. Hoep you get them. Phil Anders, Thanks for the files. I was aware that the EGU was starting a new paleo journal. I don't think there have been any issues yet. I thought Keith had put those two series on our web site, but I can't find them either. However, I found them ages and put them with some of the other long tree-ring series. So here they are with others. The ones you want should be in columns 1 and 2. The file starts in 1628BC, so it takes a while to get to them. They start in AD 500. I vaguely recall chopping off the 402-499 and 441-499 years because of sample size. Keith has more trw series now, so they could be improved. Keith should have a reconstruction from the Grudd et al. (2002) paper in The Holocene, but they must be on his machine. I hope the papers for the two Fennoscandian series tell you what the base period is. Given the publication dates I would suspect it is 1951-80. There are newer series for Jasper and Tasmania and I wouldn't bother doing anything with the two South American series. Have a good summer break. Ruth and I have sat out every night this week so far. We watched birds the last two days denuding the cherry tree of cherries. Cheers Phil At 07:52 23\/06\/2005, you wrote: Phil, Here are the data we used in our Nature paper, minus Indigirka and Lauritzen. All series are interpolated to annual resolution. Brief info in file headers. The details are found in the online supplementary info on nature.com Lauritzen's email: \"S. E. Lauritzen\" The Finnish diatom series and all eastern tree ring series have been sent through personal contacts. The rest comes from the web, apart from GRIP which comes from you. Could you, in return, send me the data file for the Fennoscandian summer temperature reconstruction from either Briffa et al (Nature 1990) or Briffa et al (Clim Dyn 1992) - or both? I could not find any of these series on the CRU website. I realize that Isabelle Gouirand will have to discuss these two papers. Starting from there and try to point out something new as regards the work done by Isabelle. By the way, do you know anything about this journal: [1] ? I did not know it existed, before I was told about it yesterday. Tomorrow starts my summer holidays, which last over the coming four weeks Cheers, Anders At 10:07 2005-06-17 +0100, you wrote: Anders, When I got back the bus was still here and the driver had disappeared.

China shoudl be relabeled as east Asia as it does include some information from Japan and the Tibetan Plateau (L. Thompson) and we don't want to get into some political to-do by calling Tibet \"Chinese\". that's all I can think of for present, good sailing, tom Keith Briffa wrote: Hi all think this is resolved now (virtually) - We use series that total to Tom\/Gabi composite , and we can cite this as an example of the scatter of regional records \"in a typical reconstruction\". This avoids very difficult issue of what is the best way to aggregate certain data sets - we are simply illustrating the point with one published (by then) data set. The issue of the composite is then not an issue either , because it is not a new (unpublished) composite that we were concerned about - though I still believe it is a distraction to put the composite in. It would be best to use data from 800 or 850 at least , and go to 1500 (?) and presumably normalise over the whole period of data shown. OK? Even though you guys all wish to go with the reduced period (ie not up the present) , but my own instinct is that this might later come back to haunt us - but will take your lead. I agree the look of the Figure should match the others. So, if Tom will send the data sets (his regional curves) , Tim will plot and send back asap for scrutiny. Thanks Tom and thanks for your help with this - further comments on latest version of 6.5 (last 2000 years) still welcome , though will be incorporating a few changes in response to David and Fortunat input , and SH bit (from Ricardo and Ed) still to go in and regional section to be revised (after input from Peck et al.) cheers Keith . At 21:42 19\/07\/2005, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: Hi Keith and Tim: Just got off the phone with Eystein, and hopefully he will sleep ok knowing that we have a plan for the MWP fig and Tom... Please ask questions if we don't cover all the key points, but here's what we think: 1) the MWP fig should span the MWP only, and should emphasize variation in regional amplitude (we agree that we must be clear that this fig is not a reconstruction) - that is, it is best to use time series representing regions, assuming that the regional series do represent a region ok with one or more input series. We want to avoid a regional bias if we can - this is what got us into all the MWP misunderstanding in the first place, perhaps (e.g., nice MWP in Europe\/Atlantic region - must be global) 2) If you guys could agree on the series and the interval, that'd be great. We agree it would be good to start before 1000 and end before the Renaissance (15th century?). If you want more feedback on these issues, we're happy to provide, but it seems logical that you pick series and intervals so that each series covers the entire interval selected. 3) Don't use the Chesapeak record - it is likely biased by salinity 4) We'd like Keith and Tim to draft the final figure so that it matches the look and style of the other two figs they have made. Hope this is doable. Tom, does Keith have all the data? Thanks for sending if not. 5) We agree that Tom should NOT be a CA given that he was officially one of the ZOD reviewers. Of course, this doesn't represent a real conflict, but we need to avoid even the appearance of conflict. We greatly appreciate all the feedback that Tom is providing! Is this plan ok w\/ you Tom? We think you're cool with it, but just want to check one more time. That... it is. Please let us know if there are any more questions. Keith - feel free to try and get Eystein on his cell doing your work hours if you want quick feedback. Or we can do this by email - he's not in a very email friendly place right now, but the fishing appears to be ok.

{"text":"Hi Marco, Daniel, First, I have seen that you have finally decided to go with the new price list presentation . I'm OK with this . Second, I have seen that you have tried to create a smaller configuration of the system for RAB (compared with DANY): for example putting 3 anonymizers instead of 6, and 1 collector instead of 2. Again, I'm also OK with it \u2026  Except that we need to be careful and correct\/replace everything in the text: I have seen in page 2 (the letter) that we are still speaking about 2 collectors and 6 anonymizers. And also in the table page 5 and 6, there is still mention of 6 anonymizers and we also explain redundancy with 2 collectors. So careful ! I suggest to review completely the text, so that we can correct this before sending it to customer. Third, I am seeing that you are changing the prices of the modules \u2026and for this, I would do a different approach  (meaning I'm not OK with it :-)) I suggest not to change the price list. It should be unique. The price list and the price for each module cannot be changed to the benefit of one specific customer \/ market, etc\u2026Otherwise, it is like having NO price list. What I suggest is to maintain the same price AND provide discounts in order to adapt to specific customer \/ market\u2026 This approach has the advantage of keeping the same price list AND adapting to specific budget. You also gain Customer by providing him a discount (he should be happy), and not putting your price down. So for instance: the Master Node should stay always at 220K\u20ac\u2026If you want to propose it for 150K\u20ac, then you leave the price of 220K\u20ac in the table and you should put a discount at the end of the table (before the total) of - 70K\u20ac, in order to arrive to the same amount of 150K\u20ac\u2026 Same for the Collectors: 2 are priced 140K\u20ac, so 1 collector should be 70K\u20ac minimum or even 80K\u20ac, because you only purchase one\u2026If you want to propose the price of 60K\u20ac, then it is a -10K\u20ac additional discount at the end. 3 anonymizers should be 50K\u20ac, not 30K\u20ac, because 6 anonymizers are 100K\u20ac And so on for the Console, the Physical Vectors, the 10 concurrent agents, etc\u2026 In summary, we should have only one price list ! it has to be enforced. Then we create specific configurations for specific customer , and we can adapt providing specific discounts \u2026 So for RAB, the price list of their system should be kept at around or above (depending of the module) the price of  790K\u20ac - 160K\u20ac discount = 630\u20ac  (if you want to keep this price for the customer).  In the table you can add a line of SUBTOTAL, then add a line of SPECIAL DISCOUNT, then complete the line of TOTAL. The same for the Professional Services. Provide a discount instead of changing the price. I don't mind if the discount is huge\u2026Our price list should be high, even if our proposal are at a lower price\u2026You gain from positioning high price AND providing discounts (even before negotiations). I really insist here ! this is pure marketing positioning and pricing engineering...we need to be extremely coherent and disciplined in this approach.  Sorry for this long email.

{"text":"SL: Trump's Republican Party Has Already Started Punishing Women in Oklahoma [Factivist banner.jpg] In yet another effort to dismantle women's health, the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature passed an unconstitutional bill, over the objections of their lone physician legislator, that would making performing an abortion a felony and prevent any doctors who have performed an abortion from practicing in the state. This is just the latest example of Republicans across the country taking their cues from Donald Trump, who has a decades-long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny. He stated that \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women who get abortions and would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. \"While Donald Trump talks about punishing women for abortions, but Republican legislatures in states like Oklahoma are actually doing it. State lawmakers have enacted hundreds of abortion restrictions over the past few years, making it harder and more dangerous for women to obtain abortion and health services. Democrats will continue to stand against Republican politicians getting involved in a woman's personal health decisions.\" - Shu-Yen Wei, spokeswoman for the DNC ###","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Mr. Matthews, Unfortunately Phil Jones is travelling and will probably be unable to offer a separate reply. Since your comments involve work that is his as well, I have therefore taken the liberty of copying your inquiry and this reply to several of his British colleagues. The comparisons made in our paper are well explained therein, and your statements belie the clearly-stated qualifications in our conclusions with regard to separate analyses of the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and globe. An objective reading of our manuscript would readily reveal that the comments you refer to are scurrilous. These comments have not been made by scientists in the peer-reviewed literature, but rather, on a website that, according to published accounts, is run by individuals sponsored by ExxonMobile corportation, hardly an objective source of information. Owing to pressures on my time, I will not be able to respond to any further inquiries from you. Given your extremely poor past record of reporting on climate change issues, however, I will leave you with some final words. Professional journalists I am used to dealing with do not rely upon un-peer-reviewed claims off internet sites for their sources of information. They rely instead on peer-reviewed scientific research, and mainstream, rather than fringe, scientific opinion. Sincerely, Michael E. Mann At 08:30 PM 10\/2\/2003 +0100, Robert Matthews wrote: Dear Professor Mann I'm putting together a piece on global warming, and I'll be making reference to your paper in Geophysical Research Letters with Prof Jones on \"Global surface temperatures over the past two millennia\". When the paper came out, some critics argued that the paper actually showed that there have been three periods in the last 2000 years which were warmer than today (one just prior to AD 700, one just after, and one just prior to AD 1000). They also claimed that the paper could only conclude that current temperatures were warmer if one compared the proxy data with other data sets. (For an example of these arguments, see: [1] I'd be very interested to include your rebuttals to these arguments in the piece I'm doing. I must admit to being confused by why proxy data should be compared to instrumental data for the last part of the data-set. Shouldn't the comparison be a consistent one throughout ?

{"text":"DNC Talking Points on the Ted Cruz \/ Carly Fiorina Ticket * This is a desperate attempt by a desperate campaign to change the narrative after netting only a single delegate in last night's contests. * By selecting a VP candidate when he is less than halfway to the nomination, Ted Cruz is even more delusional than John Kasich, who has only won his home state, and Marco Rubio, who gave a victory speech after a third place finish in Iowa. * It's fitting that Senator Cruz, best known for shutting down the U.S. government, would select Carly Fiorina as his VP, best known for almost shutting down a great U.S. company. * As CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina: o Cut HP's stock value in half o Laid off 30,000 workers after an ill-advised merger with Compaq o Outsourced American jobs to other countries o Sold computer equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions o Received a $40 million golden parachute upon being fired o Earned status as one of the \"Worst American CEOs of all Time\" * Don't be fooled: Cruz and Fiorina are not \"outsiders.\" Cruz has been in politics for decades and has collected a government paycheck since 1999, and Fiorina is only an \"outsider\" because California voters overwhelmingly rejected her candidacy, even in a banner year for Republicans. Here's what some others have had to say about Fiorina's disastrous tenure at HP: \"A consummate self-promoter, Fiorina was busy pontificating on the lecture circuit and posing for magazine covers while her company floundered. She paid herself handsome bonuses and perks while laying off thousands of employees to cut costs. The merger Fiorina orchestrated with Compaq in 2002 was widely seen as a failure. She was ousted in 2005.\" -CNBC Portfolio's list of worst CEOs of all time \"The stock price dropped by 50% only to rally 10% on the announcement of her firing. She fired 28,000 people before she herself was fired, departing with the 21 million dollar golden parachute that is financing her campaign.\" -Arianna Packard, granddaughter of the late HP co-founder David Packard \"She walked into a fundamentally sound, healthy, vibrant company and had a disastrous tour of duty. She sliced shareholder wealth in half and had a reign of terror that was infamous for its scapegoating, finger-pointing culture.\" -Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management \"Call her the anti-Steve Jobs. During her 1999-2005 tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorina proved that she could reverse decades of geek goodwill and alienate customers like no one else. She oversaw the spin-off of HP's well-respected instruments and medical equipment business, outsourced its beloved calculator division, then issued 7,000 pink slips.

{"text":"Ben, I have attached the tropical mean trend profiles, now for the period 1979-1999. RAOBCORE versions show much more upper tropospheric heating for this period, RICH shows slightly more heating. Note also stronger cooling of unadjusted radiosondes in stratospheric layers compared to 1999-2004. Just for information I have included also zonal mean trend plots for the unadjusted radiosondes (tm), RAOBCORE v1.4 (tmcorr) and RICH (rgmra) I do not suggest that these plots should be included but some of you maybe want to know about the spatial coherence of the zonal mean trends. It is interesting to see the lower tropospheric warming minimum in the tropics in all three plots, which I cannot explain. I believe it is spurious but it is remarkably robust against my adjustment efforts. Meridional resolution is 10 degrees. As you can imagine, the tropical upper tropospheric heating maximum at 5S and the cooling in the unadjusted radiosondes at 5N are based on very few long records in these belts. 2-3 in 5S, about 5 in 5N. Best regards and I wish you all a happy new year.

The court chose instead to uphold a restrictive and discriminatory measure, which has already significantly burdened voters of color in the state. We intend to seek relief for provisions including the expansion of voter challenges, the elimination of same-day registration, the rollback of a week of early voting, a ban on the use of out of precinct provisional ballots, the removal of a successful preregistration program for 16- and 17-year-olds and a restrictive photo ID requirement. The current injunction on the law's proscriptions of same day registration and out of precinct voting \u2013 which has been in place since 2015, will remain in effect until June. Advancement Project, along with co-counsel from Kirkland & Ellis, LLP and attorneys Irving Joyner and Adam Stein, challenged H.B. 589 on behalf of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. The groups will hold a media conference call on Tuesday, April 26 at 11:30 am EST to discuss the decision, and conference call details are forthcoming. A partial statement is outlined below: \"The continuation of H.B. 589's restrictive provisions is an affront to democracy, and we intend to appeal the decision,\" said the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and architect of the Forward Together Moral Movement. \"Through widespread actions, rallies, marches and protests, we have said all along that we would accept no less than unabridged access to the ballot for all eligible voters. Just like those who carried on before us, we will continue our movement challenging regressive and discriminatory voter suppression tactics on behalf of African Americans, Latinos, seniors, students and all those for whom democracy has been denied.\" \"In abridging voting rights for African Americans and Latinos, H.B. 589 turns back the clock to our nation's terrible Jim Crow past,\" said Advancement Project Co-Director Penda D. Hair. \"In a democracy, voting should be free, fair and accessible for all eligible voters. H.B. 589 tactically targets the provisions that once made North Carolina among the states with the highest turnout in the nation. This progress was especially clear among African-American and Latino voters, who came to rely on measures like early voting, same-day registration and out of precinct provisional ballots to ensure their voices were heard. By specifically targeting the very measures that were most used by people of color \u2013 in addition to imposing a restrictive photo ID requirement \u2013 the legislature sought to disturb the levers of power in North Carolina. This fight is not over. This is just one step in a legal battle that is going to continue in the courts to ensure that the Voting Rights Act protects voters against discriminatory voting measures like H.B. 589.\" \"The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals understood the ways in which H.B. 589 would impact voters of color in North Carolina, and previously enjoined portions of this law,\" said Advancement Project Senior Attorney Denise Lieberman. \"Now with even more evidence of the measure's discriminatory impact on voters of color, we intend to once again take our case to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" \"North Carolina's suppressive voting law was exactly the type of regulation that the Voting Rights Act was written to combat,\" said Advancement Project Senior Attorney Donita Judge. \"Had this law been subjected to federal preclearance, it simply never could have passed. Now, countless voters, especially voters of color, are at risk of losing their voice in our elections. This is unacceptable in a democracy.\" # # # Advancement Project is a multi-racial civil rights organization. Founded by a team of veteran civil rights lawyers in 1999, Advancement Project was created to develop and inspire community-based solutions based on the same high quality legal analysis and public education campaigns that produced the landmark civil rights victories of earlier eras.

Says multiple times there will be no second ballot at the convention and that is why the campaign isn't focused on stealing state delegates like Cruz is Paul Manafort interview * You met with RNC to reassure them, said Trump has been playing a part. He's been campaigning for 10 monhs and we haven't seen real man? o That was about what settings he's been. You've seen real Trump in campaign mode o RNC has a different mode-wants to know if Trump is going to be giving policy speeches, etc, which he will * But it does sound like spin, doesn't seem like you were talking about rallies vs speeches o But that is what I was saying, it's been distorted o Trump has been saying when I'm at rallies, I want to show you who I am in this environment, when I'm giving policy speeches, I'm giving policy speeches * Cruz has said Trump the Conservative is just a show, trying to fool gullible voters o Well there's the liar, not Trump o He's got to change to conversation, narrative, because he's had the nomination eliminated for him o Cruz made this up from whole cloth, trump never said he isn't building a wall o Cruz is going to lose all five Tues states, come in third in most o Like with Carson and Rubio, Cruz just makes things up * Cruz had a good weekend-one of your jobs is to get delegates committed, Cruz won a lot of their support, 65-2 for you o You've been around a long time Chris, the only vote that matters is the vote cast when the roll is called. Cruz won 0 delegates for that vote yesterday o Other problems happened before I was involved o Cruz is bending to rules, in Maine the governor put together a slate based on primary results, Cruz broke the deal, didn't care about local officials, steamrolled it. That's not the trump approach o We're running a campaign to win folks on first ballot, and we are o What Cruz is doing is hurting the party. There will be no second ballot. * You became a lobbyist after Reagan white house, you have controversial clients (foreign dictators), your firm were called torturer's lobby o I was representing the administration's chosen groups in Philippines, other countries * Not Yanukovich o I worked with Europeans to bring Ukraine into Europe, role I played was to help that happen * Cruz calls yours a lobbyist campaign o The people he's talking about haven't been lobbying for 10-20 years * His point is that Trump's anti-establishment outsider status is no longer valid o I'm not running, Trump is, Trump is clearly an outsider, and he's established that o Cruz is trying to say the process, voting, doesn't matter o He wants to destroy the party and see who can pick up the pieces on the 2nd, 3rd ballot o We're trying to work with Mitch McConnell in KY to put together a unity slate o We're working with party officials, we didn't want to go into a state in be disruptive, as Cruz did o We want to make sure people who Trump hasn't been exposed to know we're going to work with them * Trump said transgender people can use whatever bathroom they want (it would be discriminatory, expensive), but then Trump said it was state's rights. What does he think about NC law o He thinks what he said, that it's a states' rights issues o It's not a reversal * But 12 hours before he said leave it the way it is, no real problem there o Trump said what his personal opinion was, and then he said how he would handle it, called it state's rights issue * Trump foreign policy speech using teleprompters, are you trying to drag him kicking to be more presidential o It's not a new campaign, it's an expanded campaign o Trump had to establish legitimacy, win primaries, become presumptive nominee, all of which he did, now he's in next phase From: Brinster, Jeremy Sent: Sunday, April 24, 2016 9:02 AM To: Comm_D Subject: FNS 4-24-16 Opens with Trump re-brand","label":0}

Thanks all From:demcommunications@googlegroups.com On Behalf Of Walker, Eric Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 9:13 AM To: demcommunications@googlegroups.com Subject: [COMMUNICATIONS] Press events re: this week's Trump\/Ryan meeting Hey everyone \u2013 Tomorrow, Donald Trump is coming to Washington D.C. to meet with Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, and Mitch McConnell. The Ryan meeting is the highlight because Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump thus far. This is an ideal opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives not ready to fully endorse his Party's nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates, former Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates trying to distance themselves from their standard bearer. We're asking state party communications directors to put together events around Thursday morning's Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the message that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. We're also asking state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio. Attached please find a packet with materials to put together an event. In this packet you'll find: \u00b7 Sample talking points \/ message guidance \u00b7 A sample advisory \u00b7 A sample press release \u00b7 A sample op-ed \u00b7 Four sample letters to the editor DNC can offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out to walker@dnc.org if you would like to book one of our surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washington can also use our studio to do local hits. Here's what we're looking for in terms of event logistics: \u00b7 Types of speakers: o State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs o Local Elected Officials o Allied Groups \u2013 Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc. o Labor o People sharing personal stories \u00b7 About 15-20 supporters \u00b7 Signs that say \"Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda\" \u2013 we have a mockup that can be found here . \u00b7 A big push to get local TV to the event \u2013 studies show that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news. The Republican Party has elevated offensive policies and extreme voices using divisive campaigns for years, and now they're stuck with Donald Trump's reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general election. We have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every state accountable for their Party's dysfunction as they chaotically tumble toward the general election. And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreement that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support either one of our candidates. This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Republicans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle-down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking Americans. It's the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession . We can't afford to go back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.

{"text":"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.

Stephen Wise Temple has been a partner with Jewish World Watch (JWW) since its inception in 2004 at the height of the Darfur Genocide. Started on the premise of \"Never Again,\" JWW's humanitarian work continues in both the Darfur refugee camps in Chad and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. JWW has visited the DRC twice this summer, and if you were compelled by the stories from last High Holy Days, you will be inspired and moved to read the blogs from this Summer's trips. Mitzvah Day is not far off, Sunday, November 2, where you will be able to engage with hands-on JWW activities, but here is an opportunity to further understand how our Holocaust past moves us to tell today's genocidal stories and recovery.

{"text":"Dear all I went to this meeting in London yesterday - which was useful. Julie will photocopy my notes\/the overheads for you some time this week (if she doesnt have time, I'll do it when I get back next week). In the meantime, here are my main impressions\/thoughts from the meeting. (Incidentally, Alex Haxeltine was due to go from UEA, but didnt turn up. Not sure who the other UEA people were! There was no list of participants.) Maybe we should get together (next week some time?) once you've had chance to look at some of this. The Commission (EC) seems to be favouring smaller projects, e.g., typically 10 million Euro. Though it is up to proposers to define the necessary 'critical mass'. UKRO seem quite wary of Networks of Excellence (NoE), e.g., warning of potential conflicts of interest with institutions. As with projects, smaller size seems to be in favour. An UKRO analysis suggests an NoE of 150-400 researchers would maximise the amount of money received per researcher. Research activities can now be funded in NoE (the EC has changed its mind on this in the last month), but only if focused on integration. The EC wont be proposing indicators of integration for NoE - the proposals should explain how this will be 'measured'. Consortium quality seems to be an important concern for the EC, i.e., having the right people for the job and ensuring everyone has a clear role. In our rush to get a 'critical mass', I'm concerned that the GENIE consortium may appear too much as 'all our friends'. One possible strategy which UKRO seemed to think quite good for people, would be to put in a proposal from 6-8 key partners, indicating for which activities additional partners will be brought in at appropriate points. The EC will be providing formal procedures for these 'internal project' calls. It is unlikely that the new online proposal preparation tool will be ready for the first call, but electronic submission (on CD) should be possible. Any paper submissions will be scanned. Evaluation will be by electronic means initially, with possibility of proposers (and evaluators?) being invited to hearings in Brussels prior to panel meetings. No signatures are required for the proposals (though a password\/username will be required by co-ordinators to access the online system). Some institutions\/consortia are apparently drawing up pre-consortia agreements or letters of intent\/memorandum of understanding. The guide for proposers is currently only in very rough draft. There will be a second 'EOI' type exercise at the end of 2003\/early 2004. This could lead to changes in the indicative themes for 2004. UKRO is not keen on UK institutions using consultants for project management - we should be building our own capacity. Proposals should be written for the informed lay person. It is best if they are not obviously written by one person - better to show joint effort\/co-ordination at an early stage. Redundancy costs (i.e., costs of implementing the new fixed-term regulations) can be included for research staff. The EC aims to audit all FP6 projects (because there will be fewer of them). Recognition of the ERA and policy links will be important for the EC. (The ERA includes references to developing long-term careers for research staff and increasing the involvement of women - so maybe we should be thinking of some activities to address these issues.) IPR will be an important issue in FP6 - need to get expert advice (e.g., what happens if consortium changes over course of project). Consortium agreements will be compulsory. The proposal forms (for IPs anyway) are relatively simple, e.g., only need to cost four different types of activity.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. Enron Engineering and Operational Services Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant. Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK. John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor\/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility. Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas. Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit. Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days. EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly. Enron Industrial Markets The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities. The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and\/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers. Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly. As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts. Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply\/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps. IN THE NEWS HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman. \"Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman,\" Lay said. \"In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe.\" Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.

{"text":"Mike and all Hi , just back from a trip and only now catching up with important emails. Given the restricted time and space available to furnish a response to SB comments , I offer the following mix of comment and specific wording changes: I agree that the S+B response is designed to deflect criticism by confusing the issues rather than answering our points. In fact they fail to address any of the 3 specific issues we raised Namely , 1. the need for critical evaluation of proxy inputs , 2. the need for a consistent assimilation of widespread (dated and well resolved ) records, 3. the essential requirement for objective\/quantitative calibration (scaling) of the input records to allow for assessment of the uncertainties when making comparisons of different reconstructions and when comparing early with recent temperatures. Their own , ill-conceived and largely subjective approach did not take account of the uncertainties and problems in the use of palaeodata that they chose to highlight in their opening remarks. I would be in favour of stating something to this effect at the outset of our response. Also , as regards the tree-ring bit , I fully concur with the sense of your text as regards Section 1, but suggest the following wording (to replace \",rarely for annual ring widths, and almost entirely at higher latitudes.\") \"but in certain high-latitude regions only. Where this is the case , these relatively recent (ie post 1950) data are not used in calibrating temperature reconstructions. In many other (even high-latitude) areas density or ring-width records display no bias.\" In the spirit of healthy debate - I agree with Tim's remarks , warning against presenting a too sanguine impression that the borehole debate is closed ( though I do think it is closing!). I also believe , as you already know, that the use of a recent padding algorithm to extend smoothed data to the present time, is inappropriate if it assumes the continuation of a recent trend. This is likely to confuse , rather than inform, the wider public about the current climate state . Finally , I repeat my earlier remarks (made before EOS piece published) that we are missing an opportunity to say that a warm Medieval period per se is not a refutation of anthropogenic warming , {as its absence is no proof}, if we do not understand the role of specific forcings (natural and anthropogenic) that influenced medieval and current climates.

{"text":"Thanks Scott, I concur. We may want to try a few different alignment\/scaling choices in the end, and then just vote on which we like the best, Anxious to here others' thoughts on all of this, mike At 10:53 AM 3\/12\/2003 -0500, Scott Rutherford wrote: Dear All, First, I'd be willing to handle the data and the plotting\/mapping. Second, regarding Mike's suggestions, if we use different reference periods for the reconstructions and the models we need to be extremely careful about the differences. Not having seen what this will look like, I suggest that we start with the same instrumental reference period for both (1856-1960). If you are willing to send me your series please send the raw (i.e. unfiltered) series. That way I can treat them all the same. We can then decide how we want to display the results. Finally, Tom's suggestion of Eos struck me as a great way to get a short, pointed story out to the most people (though I have no feel for the international distribution). My sense (being relatively new to this field compared to everyone else) is that within the neo- and mesoclimate research community there is a (relatively small?) group of people who don't or won't \"get it\" and there is nothing we can do about them aside from continuing to publish quality work in quality journals (or calling in a Mafia hit). Those (e.g. us) who are engrossed in the issues and are aware of all the literature should be able to distinguish between well done and poor work. Should then the intent of this proposed contribution be to education those who are not directly involved in MWP\/LIA issues including those both on the perifery of the issue as well as those outside? If so, then the issue that Phil raised about not letting it get buried is significant and I think Eos is a great way to get people to see it. Cheers, Scott On Wednesday, March 12, 2003, at 10:32 AM, Michael E. Mann wrote: p.s. The idea of both a representative time-slice spatial plot emphasizing the spatial variability of e.g. the MWP or LIA, and an EOF analysis of all the records is a great idea. I'd like to suggest a small modification of the latter: I would suggest we show 2 curves, representing the 1st PC of two different groups, one of empirical reconstructions, the other of model simulations, rather than just one in the time plot. Group #1 could include: 1) Crowley & Lowery 2) Mann et al 1999 3) Bradley and Jones 1995 4) Jones et al, 1998 5) Briffa et al 200X? [Keith\/Tim to provide their preferred MXD reconstruction] 6) Esper et al [yes, no?--one series that differs from the others won't make much of a difference] I would suggest we scale the resulting PC to the CRU 1856-1960 annual Northern Hemisphere mean instrumental record, which should overlap w\/ all of the series, and which pre-dates the MXD decline issue... Group #2 would include various model simulations using different forcings, and with slightly different sensitivities. This could include 6 or so simulation results: 1) 3 series from Crowley (2000) [based on different solar\/volcanic reconstructions], 2) 2 series from Gerber et al (Bern modeling group result) [based on different assumed sensitivities] 1) Bauer et al series (Claussen group EMIC result) [includes 19th\/20th century land use changes as a forcing]. I would suggest that the model's 20th century mean is aligned with the 20th century instrumental N.Hem mean for comparison (since this is when we know the forcings best). I'd like to nominate Scott R. as the collector of the time series and the performer of the EOF analyses, scaling, and plotting, since Scott already has many of the series and many of the appropriate analysis and plotting tools set up to do this. We could each send our preferred versions of our respective time series to Scott as an ascii attachment, etc. thoughts, comments? thanks, mike At 10:08 AM 3\/12\/2003 -0500, Michael E.

I suggest two figures- one on time series and another showing the spatial array of temperatures at one point in the Middle Ages. I produced a few of those for the Ambio paper but already have one ready for the Greenland settlement period 965-995 showing the regional nature of the warmth in that figure. we could add a few new sites to it, but if people think otherwise we could of course go in some other direction. rather than getting into the delicate question of which paleo reconstruction to use I suggest that we show a time series that is an eof of the different reconstructions - one that emphasizes the commonality of the message. Tom Dear All, I agree with all the points being made and the multi-authored article would be a good idea, but how do we go about not letting it get buried somewhere. Can we not address the misconceptions by finally coming up with definitive dates for the LIA and MWP and redefining what we think the terms really mean? With all of us and more on the paper, it should carry a lot of weight. In a way we will be setting the agenda for what should be being done over the next few years. We do want a reputable journal but is The Holocene the right vehicle. It is probably the best of its class of journals out there. Mike and I were asked to write an article for the EGS journal of Surveys of Geophysics. You've not heard of this - few have, so we declined. However, it got me thinking that we could try for Reviews of Geophysics. Need to contact the editorial board to see if this might be possible. Just a thought, but it certainly has a high profile. What we want to write is NOT the scholarly review a la Jean Grove (bless her soul) that just reviews but doesn't come to anything firm. We want a critical review that enables agendas to be set. Ray's recent multi-authored piece goes a lot of the way so we need to build on this. Cheers Phil At 12:55 11\/03\/03 -0500, Michael E. Mann wrote: HI Malcolm, Thanks for the feedback--I largely concur. I do, though, think there is a particular problem with \"Climate Research\". This is where my colleague Pat Michaels now publishes exclusively, and his two closest colleagues are on the editorial board and review editor board. So I promise you, we'll see more of this there, and I personally think there *is* a bigger problem with the \"messenger\" in this case... But the Soon and Baliunas paper is its own, separate issue too. I too like Tom's latter idea, of a more hefty multi-authored piece in an appropriate journal (Paleoceanography? Holocene?) that seeks to correct a number of misconceptions out there, perhaps using Baliunas and Soon as a case study ('poster child'?), but taking on a slightly greater territory too. Question is, who would take the lead role. I *know* we're all very busy, mike At 10:28 AM 3\/11\/03 -0700, Malcolm Hughes wrote: I'm with Tom on this. In a way it comes back to a rant of mine to which some of you have already been victim. The general point is that there are two arms of climatology: neoclimatology - what you do based on instrumental records and direct, systematic observations in networks - all set in a very Late Holocene\/Anthropocene time with hourly to decadal interests. paleoclimatology - stuff from rocks, etc., where major changes in the Earth system, including its climate, associated with major changes in boundary conditions, may be detected by examination of one or a handful of paleo records. Between these two is what we do - \"mesoclimatology\" - dealing with many of the same phenomena as neoclimatology, using documentary and natural archives to look at phenomena on interannual to millennial time scales. Given relatively small changes in boundary conditions (until the last couple of centuries), mesoclimatology has to work in a way that is very similar to neoclimatology. Most notably, it depends on heavily replicated networks of precisely dated records capable of being either calibrated, or whose relationship to climate may be modeled accuarately and precisely. Because this distinction is not recognized by many (e.g. Sonnechkin, Broecker, Karlen) we see an accumulation of misguided attempts at describing the climate of recent millennia. It would be better to head this off in general, rather than draw attention to a bad paper. After all, as Tom rightly says, we could all nominate really bad papers that have been published in journals of outstanding reputation (although there could well be differences between our lists).

{"text":"Definitional nit to pick: Robert Harley writes: > It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, > precisely identical between males and females. > > Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ. You've redefined \"promiscuity\" above as \"total\" or \"average\" activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: activity above some specific threshold (usually \"one\") or norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. \"Promiscuity\" is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages. Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are: - above the single partner threshold - above the overall average 1.67 acts\/partners threshold - above the overall median 1.5 acts\/partners - above the overall mode 1 acts\/partners And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) number of partners. So in this contrived population, females are more \"promiscuous\" than males, unless \"promiscuity\" is defined uselessly. - Gordon","label":0}
{"text":"Excerpts below, Luis. Let me know if I'm good to blast, and I'll do so right now (to our National and Alaska lists). Otherwise, I can hold until the AM. For Immediate Release May 14, 2016 Contact: DNC Press - 202-863-8148 Prepared Remarks for Delivery: DNC Chair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at Alaska State Convention ANCHORAGE -- Tonight, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed the Alaska State Convention. Below you will find excerpts as prepared for delivery: \"As chair of the DNC, I've committed myself to getting to know my fellow Democrats with visits to all fifty states - and I'll be honest, it's been a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight. ... \"But I know I'm not the only one here tonight who travelled a great distance to be at the convention - I understand there are even as many as 40 high school students coming all the way from Juneau, and who registered to be delegates - let's give them a hand for being the future of our party. \"And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across our country's largest state to show your support. \"Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our party will make all the difference on Election Day. ... \"Here in Alaska the DNC helps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters and help get them to the polls on Election Day. \"We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. In fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partnership employees we ever hired. \"Since 2009, the DNC has directly provided the Alaska Democratic Party more than $625,000 in direct support. \"But it's not just the funding -- the DNC has been out-pacing the GOP in how we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench-building; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Alaska and across the country. ... \"But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and the contrast they're offering Alaska voters and the American people. \"I couldn't be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket. \"From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart, substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter. \"We've watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at town halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to the hopes and dreams of the American people... \"And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will be united coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day. \"In the words of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders 'Trump will not be president.' ... \"I'm inspired here tonight - I wish everyone could see how much dedication the Democrats of Alaska have. \"Don't believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint Alaska red and say it isn't a battleground state means you're sidelined. \"In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans casting their vote for the Democrat has increased - from 27% in 2000 to more than 40% in 2012. \"This has already been an exciting election year nationally - working together, I know we can Dump Trump and, eventually turn Alaska Blue. \"I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election. \"So thank you for all you've done to support our party, and thank you for everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November. \"Now on to victory!

{"text":"Tim, yes, I also found it strange. We noticed that Amman and Wahl cited their Science comment as accepted in their manuscript that is now in press in Climatic Change. Personally I think it is convenient that this clarification gets published but I am somewhat disapointed by the fact that a very similar content was submitted by Buerger and Cubasch about one year ago and it was not even sent to reviewers (it is the paper that finally appeared in Tellus). I think that comment was of much higher quality than Wahl's. Science knew of the Tellus paper, since we cite it in our response. So actually there is scientifically nothing new in this exchange, but it will be published in Science...

We're so lucky to have a true Pennsylvania legend serving so graciously as the Philadelphia Host Committee Chair. Let me start by thanking everyone on the Executive Committee, all our community leaders and members of the Host Committee for your tireless work and commitment to our Party. I know you lead busy lives, but we can't pull off a successful convention without you. Let me also thank our CEO, the unparalleled Reverend, Leah Daughtry for her tireless work. We are so fortunate to have a lifelong Democrat of Leah's passion and expertise steering the ship; And of course I need to thank the honorable Mayor Jim Kenney, as well as all the wonderful people of Philadelphia who he represents. We are enormously grateful that you're hosting and warmly welcoming all the Democrats bringing their enthusiasm, energy, and passion as we arrive in greater and greater numbers over the next few months. And I know Mayor Kenney appreciates all the commerce we'll be bringing with us as conference goers visit Philly's great restaurants, hotels and small businesses. Gearing up We're just 80 days away from our Convention, and we've been making all the right moves to ensure we'll be one hundred percent prepared at kickoff time. We are on time, on budget and ready to run a beautiful convention. But as proud as I am of what we're doing, I have to mention how proud I am of who is doing it. Each day, as our numbers grow, we're making sure that our diversity does too. As Democrats, we believe our diversity is our great strength. That shows in the ranks of the DNC, where last year thirty-six percent of our employees were people of color. And we've awarded at least 35 percent of our contracts to companies owned by women, veterans, minorities, people with disabilities and members of the LGBT community. And when the nation looks at our convention, they'll see a portrait of America. Our Party Affairs and Delegate Selection team has worked tirelessly to ensure that every state party has an accessible and inclusive process for anyone to run to become a delegate. Whether it's a school teacher in Orlando, a plumber in Cleveland, or a high school student in Denver, our convention delegates will reflect the diversity our Party. Dangerous Donald But before anyone casts a vote to nominate the next Democratic president of the United States, let me give you a little update from the DNC. Today, and every day until Election Day, we are laser focused on take down holding Dangerous Donald Trump accountable - and winning seats up and down the ballot in every race across the country. With every other candidate out of the race, Trump is the Republican Party. We are not going to let anyone forget hold him accountable for everything he has said and everything he has done. And we are going to hold the GOP accountable for everything they're doing -- to obstruct, divide, and drag our country backwards. The facts are simple: Dangerous Donald is unfit to be president. He only looks out for himself. He lacks the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief. And every aspect of his presidency would harm our country and damage our standing in the world. Even as a candidate, Dangerous Donald has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably make America less safe. He has no foreign policy experience - but don't worry about that - he said he'll rely on his \"good brain,\" instead of listening to experts. Dangerous. He has a decades-long record of denigrating women. Seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy. He exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media. And recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric. He's making our communities less safe and he hasn't even gotten into office. And while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success, his record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes that are designed to turn a quick a buck at the expense of his workers or everyday Americans. I'll spare you all the details, but trust me - that's the short version of what the American people are going to be hearing about Dangerous Donald over the coming months. You know, there's a reason why we saw Republicans across the country this week tweeting photos of their burning voter registration cards this week. Advantage, Democrats Well, we have a message for anyone disillusioned and disaffected by this year's unprecedentedly nasty and divisive Republican primary - we have a message for anyone disgusted by Donald: You have a home in the Democratic Party. We have the best candidates, the best ideas, and a fantastic record of social and economic progress under President Obama to run on - 73 consecutive months of private sector job growth and 20 million Americans who have health insurance who didn't before. In poll after poll, Democratic voters are reporting that our primary and our candidates have energized our party. In Nevada, voter registration among Democrats is beating Republicans two-to-one. So no matter what challenges lie ahead in the planning and execution of our convention, let me just say, clearly and unequivocally - I am really, really glad we are not planning the Republican convention. And I am absolutely optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. Conclusion Finally, I'll just say, this convention is about so much more than the spectacle of big political speeches under red-white-and-blue balloons and confetti, although I think we might have some of that in store... This is about the direction of our nation. This is about the power of the people to come together and choose the best leader for the job. And no matter which of our candidates they choose, they'll be fighting every day for all Americans. We're fighting to level the playing field, raise wages, ensure equal pay, end discrimination, expand voting rights, make our country and our communities more secure and fighting to give hardworking Americans everywhere a fair shot. When it comes time to nominate our choices for President and Vice President, with your help, we will unify, fight together as Democrats. And friends, when the convention ends, we will go roaring into the general election with all the passion, grit and energy it takes to elect Democrats from the top of the ticket down. So thank you for all your work, thank you for your commitment to our party, and enjoy the rest of the evening. Thank you.","label":0}

{"text":"Donald Trump's Campaign Trail May Take Detour to Scotland Maggie Haberman Donald J. Trump is going to spend his time in the coming weeks before the Republican Party's nominating convention in July considering a running mate, musing potential Supreme Court picks \u2014 and, possibly, heading to Scotland for a ribbon-cutting. Mr. Trump is considering whether to travel to Scotland in June for the unveiling of the renovated Trump Turnberry, a famous golf course that he acquired in 2014 and which has hosted championships. \"We just did a massive renovation of the whole place,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview this week. \"We're having an opening in June, and the question is, will I fly over, cut the ribbon and fly right back, or not.\" Such a trip could have advantages, particularly if Mr. Trump was able to schedule meetings with European officials to add a presidential patina. But it would also take him off the campaign trail in a heated battle over the economy and jobs. Such foreign trips taken by presidential nominees, if they include ceremonial stops and meetings, can be fraught with peril. Mitt Romney's trip to Europe in 2012 was pockmarked with troublesome encounters and negative headlines. So was a trip taken by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in late 2014.","label":0}

{"text":"Wasserman Schultz Statement on First Confirmed U.S. Zika Virus Death Washington, DC - U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23) issued the following statement today after Puerto Rico confirmed the first death from the Zika virus: \"I'm saddened to learn that we have already suffered our first death from the Zika virus and my thoughts are with the victim's family. As I've said for months, this is an unfolding public health crisis in Florida and Puerto Rico and soon, other parts of the nation. We need House Republicans to stop dragging their feet on emergency supplemental funding for Zika and join President Obama and Congressional Democrats by taking immediate action to arrest this burgeoning health crisis.\" ### Read the statement online . Earlier this week, Rep. Wasserman Schultz, Rep. Nita Lowey (NY-17) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) introduced H.R. 5044, an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to mount a robust response to the Zika virus at home and abroad. The bill reflects the Administration's request of February 22, 2016 for a total of $1.9 billion in emergency spending. The request is updated to include increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for vaccine and diagnostic research and development, and a corresponding reduction in funding for CDC Facilities and a Contingency Fund to respond to emerging needs.

The cake scene is maybe a little bit too long, but the ending is sweet. I'm glad there are baby Wolfpups that can be very much appreciated in our market.

Whether you are looking for your dream job or trying to hire talented people, the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your IT talent solution today! I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort through my email system. It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2 upgrade at $129. I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources. On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the company's history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was the result of the Mandrake Linux User's Club. The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com. I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the addition of both Lindows and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved. Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use. There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple configuration issue. To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in your KDE panel. Select \"Preferences\" and the \"Execute\" tab. In the Execute window, change the command line to read: kmail --check -caption \"%c\" %i %m The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when you open the program. Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right? Recommend It!

With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel configuration is dense with details and options. I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options. For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos: The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel configuration issues Linux Network Security from Linux Planet a nice tutorial on network security Network Security with \/proc\/sys\/net\/ipv4 other approaches to network security These should get you started.

{"text":"Re: Jordan Kerner e-mail Good  _____ \u00c2 From: North, Adam To: Pascal, Amy Sent: Wed Dec 18 20:42:00 2013 Subject: Jordan Kerner e-mail His e-mail from this morning was basically saying that he liked the structure and writing of the last draft of Smurfs as well. He thinks they need more comedy, to set up Papa\/Peter as the pro tag, and focus on the origin elements more. Says he feels like they've lost time trying to make it for kids. Says you need a clear agreement on the film you want to make this week. Wants to sit down with you in January to discuss marketing. Full transcript below: Dear Amy, Not to tell tales out of school, but I have been beating my head against the wall, and I was loudly worried that the structure of the last draft and writing was much more sophisticated, and we were losing it. It was aimed at families and also the general audience we need to recapture with the \"Authorized Origin Story\" and the animation approach. I warned on many occasion that I thought you and I saw it similarly, and we were losing its humor and sophistication. We have tons of comedy work and then more comedy in the storyboards to do, we need to set Papa\/Peter as the protagonist, emphasize the ORIGIN elements as that is what the non parent, general audience is coming for, and add more real emotion. This is being discussed as a full \"reboot\" yet way more than 50% of our audience will have just seen the films 50x on DVD or Digital in the last 12 months before release. We need to be VERY fresh and inventive for animation, but we can't walk away from the good elements established in the films which generated the $900MM + which we have earned on 2 films. We have lost 4 months trying to make it for little kids primarily on a nearly impossible schedule to begin with. Kelly Asbury is on top of it and that is good. He is smart, funny and has both feet on the ground ready to sprint. So it will be OK, we just need a clear agreement on the film we all want to make this week. I would love to see you alone in early January to discuss the marketing approach. \u00c2 Thank you Amy. Know that I adore you and your ears should have been burning as Donald and I had our arms all around you at lunch together this week.\u00c2 xoxoxoxo, Jordan","label":0}

If you are unsure what comments or tetx he refers to, I think the best thing is for to ask John for the specific comments he thinks are not adequate, or the specific lines of text which he suggests changed.

Comment - Would be useful to know which reconstructions do and donot make this assumption- this could strengthen the response 3. The divergence issue- Response - it is only apparent in high latitudes, and only with some trees. Comment- Do we know what happens if we eliminate those records with a divergence problem. The wider issue is whether or not it is reasonable to extend the reconstructions outside the calibration range. 4. There are different ways of verifying reconstructions and assigning significance levels( calibration period or seprate verifying period, different statistics) Response ? Comment- it is difficult in the text to gauge how well reconstructions are validated - eg using the calibration period to estimate errors as opposed to an independent period clearly makes a difference. This is important where \"likely\", \"very likely\"are used- based on what statistics? I think this is the area where I think the current response is weakest 5. Robustness- Burger and Cubasch show a wide range of results using different assumptions- Response ? Mann makes a reasoned defence- there are other checks and tests which would rule out many of the arbitrary assumptions explored by Cubasch and Burger, but this is not clear in the response to M&M etc -- Professor Keith Briffa, Climatic Research Unit University of East Anglia Norwich, NR4 7TJ, U.K. Phone: +44-1603-593909 Fax: +44-1603-507784 -- ______________________________________________________________ Eystein Jansen Professor\/Director Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research and Dep. of Earth Science, Univ. of Bergen All\u00e9gaten 55 N-5007 Bergen NORWAY e-mail: eystein.jansen@geo.uib.no Phone: +47-55-583491 - Home: +47-55-910661 Fax: +47-55-584330","label":0}

Some of this, very fundamentally, would now seem to be open to scientific challenge, and may even face future legal enquiries. It may be in the interest of UKCIP to inform itself in good time and become a little more 'uncertain' about its policy advice. Perhaps you can comment on the following and pass the allegations made on to the relevant people. It is beyond my expertise to assess the claims made, but they would fit into my perception of the whole 'man-made global warming' cum energy policy debate. I know several of the people involved personally and have no reason to doubt their sincerity and honour as scientists, though I am also aware of their highly critical (of IPCC science) policy positions. I could also let you have statements by Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick. Ross McKitrick currently teaches at Westminister Business School and who is fully informed about the relevant issues.

{"text":"The psychs have set their sights on this county in Wyoming. According to this editorial, the suicide rate in Wyoming is double the national average and it's especially serious in Fremont County. However, as we know from every time it's been investigated, the people who commit suicide have been treated by psychiatry. The public of Wyoming DO NOT know that and may fall prey to the psych's plea to get more people in treatment to \"prevent\" suicide. We've got to put a stop to this! Read this editorial: f0698ca8588ea8725716000211d55.txt (Text below) Then write your letter to the editor. If your last name ends in A-E, J-M or S-Z, send your letter by email to daniel.sandoval@casperstartribune.net If your last name ends in F-I or N-R, send your letter to kerry.drake@casperstartribune.net And report compliance by email. Thank you, Doyle ___________________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Suicide prevention must be priority for Wyoming Monday, May 01, 2006 Star-Tribune Editorial Board Alarmed after six people took their own lives in Fremont County during the first four months of this year, officials took a good step. They launched a suicide prevention and awareness campaign for the county and the Wind River Indian Reservation. Suicide is an issue many people avoid talking about. This is one problem, however, that silence never helped solve. Wyoming has the highest rate of suicide in the country: 21 out of every 100,000 people kill themselves each year, nearly double the national average. It's a statewide problem, but it's particularly troublesome in Fremont County and on the reservation. Twenty-one years ago, people on the reservation were devastated when 10 young Arapaho men killed themselves in a two-month period. Last year, Fremont County set a record with 13 suicide deaths; if this year's pace continues unchecked, there would be 18. Experts say the most effective way to reduce the suicide rate is to let people know help is available and where they can get it. Fremont County officials are distributing pamphlets in schools and clinics, to publicize counseling services. They also are using an outdoor advertising campaign that encourages people to call 911 when a suicide threat seems imminent. At the Meadowlark Youth Facility on the reservation, young people are being encouraged to share what's happening in their lives, to ask for help, and to connect with a healthy adult. A fall conference on suicide prevention is also planned. Last year, the Wyoming Legislature recognized the state needs to do more to prevent suicides and passed a bill that created a $150,000 program. The Wyoming Department of Health was charged with coordinating efforts among the state's agencies, mental health centers and local governments. One of the results of the new law will be a suicide prevention conference, to be held May 17-19 in Casper. \"Building Bridges to a Better Tomorrow\" will bring some of the nation's leading experts and policy makers for suicide prevention to Wyoming to talk to a diverse group of participants, including mental health professionals, teachers, counselors, and law enforcement personnel. The efforts in Fremont County and Casper eventually may lead to some successful strategies that can be duplicated in other areas.

{"text":"Thanks Hannah. I agree with most of this. Especially with the idea that the first act is sorely in need of streamlining and needs to be focused around the central idea of what is at stake for Drac should Dennis be a human. The impetus for this meeting was to mainly discuss the idea aging up Dennis based on the new research so I suggest a good strategy may be to discuss some of these in that context. Particularly in light of that we just asked them to put in more pre-pregnancy Mavis based on prior thoughts and the research from last year that indicated how important she is (and that research was international and not just domestic like the recent one).Sent from my iPadOn Nov 3, 2014, at 11:22 PM, \"Minghella, Hannah\" wrote: Just watched the revised animatic and wanted to share some thoughts...Mavis's \"issue\" of wondering if getting married will limit her opportunities in life is at odds with her issue the rest of the movie. I think it's misleading. In fact, all of the business before the wedding feels superfluous. The news of the wedding isn't the conflict in the movie. What if we open on the montage of Mavis and Johnny's wedding but make it into an opening titles sequence. Make it really fun and a bigger production\/musical number. Better if the first announcement of the movie is \"I'm pregnant\" and Mavis' heart to heart with him is about the pregnancy\/baby rather than getting married. Also I think it would be better if Mavis' question - \"you don't mind that he's humany\" and Drac's response \"monster, humany, unicorn\" was about the baby instead of Johnny. It's not totally clear whether Drac is preoccupied with Dennis being a vampire from the moment he's born or only once Johnny's parents suggest Mavis and Johnny should move to live with them? Is his issue that he wants a grandson who is a monster or that he's afraid of the consequences to his family if he isn't? Why is it good for Johnny to be in on Drac's plan to take Dennis away? Maybe it would be better if Drac hatches the plan with Frank since the monsters then help sell the idea to Mavis in the next scene anyway. Not sure we want to emphasize that Mavis and Johnny have lost their zing. Too many ideas. There's also an odd negative commentary on marriage that Mavis thinks she won't get to pursue her dreams if she gets married and then within a few years of having a baby their marriage has lost its zing. The beats of Drac and the monsters demonstrating their monster skills isn't funny enough yet. After each monster fails to be scary there has to be a bigger joke to button those beats otherwise they feel somewhat anticlimactic. It should be Drac, not Frank, who says at the end of Act 2 that they need to go see Vlad. After resisting for the whole of the second act we need to understand how desperate he is to decide to go to this extreme. ----boundary-LibPST-iamunique-1369549809_-_---","label":0}

Thanks for your notes from the workshop. It sounds both interesting and very positive - I was afraid that the relations between the participants would break down completely, but you've clearly made good progress. I think a blind test of reconstruction methods is an excellent idea, and I'm happy to support it in any capacity. I've done this before with nuclear fuel performance models, and the results were both alarming and instructive. Doing it properly won't be easy though, I think several different stretches of model simulation will be required. So yes - volunteer me to Caspar (or the organising committee) to make pseudo-proxy and pseudo-instrumental data.

{"text":"Tim, Attached are the calibration residual series for experiments based on available networks back to: AD 1000 AD 1400 AD 1600 I can't find the one for the network back to 1820! But basically, you'll see that the residuals are pretty red for the first 2 cases, and then not significantly red for the 3rd case--its even a bit better for the AD 1700 and 1820 cases, but I can't seem to dig them up. In any case, the incremental changes are modest after 1600--its pretty clear that key predictors drop out before AD 1600, hence the redness of the residuals, and the notably larger uncertainties farther back... You only want to look at the first column (year) and second column (residual) of the files. I can't even remember what the other columns are! Let me know if that helps. Thanks, mike p.s. I know I probably don't need to mention this, but just to insure absolutely clarify on this, I'm providing these for your own personal use, since you're a trusted colleague. So please don't pass this along to others without checking w\/ me first.

Now I see it, it looks familiar - so perhaps you've explained it to me previously (if you have, then sorry for asking twice!). I now understand how you compute them in theory. I have two further questions though (sorry): (1) how do you compute them in practise? Do you actually integrate the spectrum of the residuals? (2) how would I estimate an uncertainty for a particular band of time scales (e.g. decadal to secular, f=0.0 to 0.1)? If integrating the spectrum of the residuals, I wonder whether integrating from f=0 to f=0.02 and then f=0.02 to (e.g.) f=0.1 (note this last limit has changed) would give me the right error for time scales of 10 years and longer (i.e. for a 10-yr low pass filter)? The way I had planned to do this was to assume the residuals could be modelled as a first order autoregressive process, with lag-1 autocorrelation r1=0.0 after 1600 (essentially white) and r1=??? before 1600. Do you know what the lag-1 autocorrelation of the residuals is for the network that goes back to 1000 AD? The stuff back 2000 years will be interesting, though the GCM runs we're starting to look at go back only 500 (Hadley Centre) or 1000 (German groups), so MBH99 seems fine for now. Cheers Tim At 14:28 31\/07\/2003, you wrote: Tim, The one-sigma *total* uncertainty is determined from adding the low f and high f components of uncertainty in quadrature. The low f and high f uncertainties aren't uncertainties for a particular (e.g. 30 year or 40-year) running mean,they are band integrated estimates of uncertainties (high-frequency band from f=0 to f=0.02, low-frequency band from f=0.02 to f=0.5 cycle\/year) taking into account the spectrum of the residual variance (the broadband or \"white noise\" mean of which is the nominal variance of the calibration residuals) Alternatively, one could calculate uncertainties for a particular timescale average using the standard deviation of the calibration residuals, and applying a square-root-N' argument (where N' is the effective degrees of freedom in the calibration residuals). I believed I did this at one point, and got similar results. Let me know if this needs further clarification. Thanks, mike p.s. you might want to try to using Mann and Jones N. Hem if you're going back further than AD 1000? Crowley has some EBM results now back to 0 AD, and is in the process of comparing w\/ that. SHould be interesting... At 02:04 PM 7\/31\/2003 +0100, you wrote: Hi Mike, we've recently been making plans with Simon Tett at the Hadley Centre for comparing model simulations with various climate reconstructions, including the MBH98 and MBH99 Northern Hemisphere temperatures. I was stressing the importance of including uncertainty estimates in the comparison and that the error estimates should depend on the timescale (e.g. smoothing filter or running mean) that had been applied. I then looked at the file that I have been using for the uncertainties associated with MBH99 (see attachment), which I must have got from you some time ago. Column 1 is year, 2 is the \"raw\" standard error, 3 is 2*SE. But what are columns 4 and 5? I've been plotting column 4, labelled \"1 sig (lowf)\" when plotted your smoothed reconstruction, assuming that this is the error appropriate to low-pass filtered data. I'd also assumed that the last column \"1 sig (highf)\" was appropriate to high-pass filtered data. I also noticed that the sum of the squared high and low errors equalled the square of the raw error, which is nice. But I've realised that I don't understand how you estimate these errors, nor what time scale the lowf and highf cutoff uses (maybe 40-year smoothed as in the IPCC plots?). From MBH99 it sounds like post-1600 you assume uncorrelated gaussian calibration residuals. In which case you would expect the errors for a 40-year mean to be reduced by sqrt(40). This doesn't seem to match the values in the attached file. Pre-1600 you take into account that the residuals are autocorrelated (red noise rather than white), so presumably the reduction is less than sqrt(40), but some factor (how do you compute this?). The reason for my questions is that I would like to (1) check whether I've been doing the right thing in using column 4 of the attached file with your smoothed reconstruction, and (2) I'd like to estimate the errors for a range of time scales, so I can compare decadal means, 30-year means, 50-year means etc. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me here.

{"text":"The Voter-ID Fight in Missouri After a decade of battles, Republicans hope to call a referendum to amend the state constitution to require photo identification to cast a ballot. * DAVID A. GRAHAM 10:29 AM ET There is a variety of origin stories for why Missouri is known as \"the Show-Me State.\" But if Republicans in the state legislature get their way, it could take on new meaning for voters headed to the polls-as in, \"Show me your photo ID.\" The state senate, which is overwhelmingly Republican, is considering a double-barreled proposal. One part is a joint resolution that would place a ballot measure before voters to create a constitutional amendment requiring voters to show photo identification to vote. The other part governs how the requirement would be enforced if approved; in particular, it would require the legislature to fund programs to help get voters who don't have some form of ID a card. If there's no money, the requirement wouldn't go into effect. The House already passed both halves in January . Senate Republicans brought the issue up Wednesday, but Democrats filibustered until 2 a.m., and the issue was temporarily set aside. Democrats have repeatedly obstructed attempts to pass the measures. Republicans are expected to bring it up again before the end of the session on May 13, and may use procedural measures to try to end the Democratic filibuster. If they succeed, Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, could veto the the bill, but his veto would likely be overridden. He can't veto the joint resolution. Missouri is one of several states to bring up tighter voting-related laws over the last few years. The bill under consideration is one of the stricter laws to come up since North Carolina passed a passel of rules to tighten voting regulations in 2013 , including shortening early voting, eliminating same-day registration, and a photo-ID requirement. That law, in turn, has been described as the nation's strictest since the Supreme Court's 2013 decision inShelby County v. Holder eliminated a requirement that jurisdictions with a history of discrimination pre-clear new voting laws with the Department of Justice, which had effectively blocked most stricter laws. The North Carolina law is subject to a court challenge. A federal judge on Monday ruled against plaintiffs challenging the law, but the decision has already been appealed, and the Fourth Circuit said Thursday it would expedite the case . Many experts expect the Supreme Court to have the final say. The arguments in Missouri are familiar from North Carolina and elsewhere: Republicans argue that voter-ID laws are essential to preserve the sanctity of elections, lest fraudulent votes be cast. Besides, they say, state-issued photo ID is required for a range of normal activities, like driving a car. Is it really so much to ask people to produce one before they vote? Democrats and other advocates respond that such laws are simply tools of voter suppression. They point out that there are next to no documented cases of voter fraud, and describe bills like this as a solution in search of a problem. They also note that driving a car, unlike voting, is not a fundamental right, and point to the fact that studies have shown that such laws are most likely to affect poor, young, and minority voters. (For example, Missouri's changes would exclude photo ID from state universities .) It's no coincidence, they say, that those are blocs that overwhelmingly vote Democratic. In some states, Republican lawmakers have slipped up and said just that. \"Now we have photo ID, and I think photo ID is going to make a little bit of a difference as well,\" U.S. Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin said earlier this month . In 2012, the Republican leader of the Pennsylvania state house said voter ID was \"gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.\" (Instead, a judge blocked the law and Obama won the state.) \"Missouri is one of those swing-ish states where you've got Republican control and the thinking is that this could make a difference, like North Carolina,\" said Rick Hasen, a professor of law of the University of California, Irvine, and election-law expert. Barack Obama narrowly lost the state in 2008, and while it might not be on the map in 2016, there is a Senate race, too. Missouri voters already have to show some form of ID to vote, but the requirement is liberal-accepted documents include an expired license, an out-of-state license, a student ID, utility bills, paychecks, and more. \"This is a piece of discrimination,\" state Representative Joe Adams, a black Democrat from St. Louis, said in January . \"It is Jim Crow in its worst form. And I would be embarrassed if I voted for this piece of legislation. I would be embarrassed to look at my children.\" In 2014, Secretary of State Jason Kander, a Democrat, released a report on the effect such a law would have and estimated that 220,000 voters could be disenfranchised under the law, though it's not entirely clear how Kander calculated that number: Among the hundreds of thousands of eligible Missouri voters that could be kept from voting by HB 1073 are students with current school-issued photo ID's, senior citizens who no longer drive, Missourians who rely on public transportation, and women who have changed their last names due to marriage or divorce. State Senator Will Kraus, one of the leading backers of the bill-and a Republican candidate to succeed Kander, who is running for U.S. Senate-has pointed to a few cases. \"There's over 16 people in the state of Missouri who have been convicted of some type of voter fraud. That shows people in the state of Missouri are trying to cheat elections,\" Kraus said in January. But as PolitiFact noted , the cases that Kraus pointed to are all cases of fraud in registration-not cases of voter impersonation, which is ostensibly what voter-ID laws combat. Kander's 2014 report stated, \"There has not been a single case of voter impersonation fraud reported to the Secretary of State's office.\" In Missouri, not only are the arguments familiar-the fight is, too. Republicans have been trying unsuccessfully to tighten the state's laws for a decade now. A 2006 attempt was passed and signed into law, but the state supreme court struck it down as an unconstitutional infringement on the right to vote, in part because itforced citizens to assume the cost of obtaining ID. In 2011, Governor Nixon vetoed another attempt . There were not enough votes to override him. The following year, state Republicans tried again, this time using a constitutional amendment to sidestep the supreme court ruling. But a judge ruled that attempt unconstitutional , too, and it was excluded from the ballot. Voter-ID laws tend to do well on the ballot. One notable exception is in Minnesota, where Democrats mobilized and blocked a constitutional amendment in 2012 . Doing that might be harder in Missouri, a redder state. As conservative-leaning states work to impose stricter voting laws, liberal ones are working to make it easier to vote. On Thursday, Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin signed a law that automatically registers citizens to vote-when they sign up for a driver's license or state ID, Missouri Republicans might archly note. Vermont is the latest in a string of states to adopt automatic voter registration. It's a sign of how polarized the U.S. has become that in a nation founded on the premise of democracy that red and blue states increasingly are so divided even on that fundamental right.","label":0}

{"text":"WEATHER: 63F, Partly Cloudy POTUS and the Administration Obama addresses 'diaper gap' on Mother's Day THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY President Obama on Sunday addressed the \"diaper gap,\" commending the many people and businesses that have joined the effort to help provide diapers to low-income families. More than 740 nonprofit locations have now been accepted into the Community Diaper Program, which is a partnership between an e-commerce company, a diaper manufacturer and local nonprofits, Obama wrote in a Medium post published on Mother's Day. The point of the partnership is to help provide free diapers to low-income families. Other American businesses donated more than 3 million diapers to diaper banks in March, the president wrote. \"And today, I'm happy to announce that more businesses have joined in this effort, adding over one million more donated diapers to that total,\" he wrote. He said people across the country have mobilized to put on diaper drives to further address the issue. Obama Weighs Visiting Hiroshima or Nagasaki NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ GARDINER HARRIS When President Obama first visited Japan in November 2009, he said he hoped someday to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the United States dropped atomic bombs during World War II. With his fourth and likely final visit to Japan as president scheduled this month for a Group of 7 meeting for leaders of industrialized nations, the White House is deciding whether Mr. Obama will follow through. No sitting American president has ever visited the cities, because of concerns that such a trip would suggest that the United States was apologizing for the attacks. \"The memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are etched in the minds of the world, and I would be honored to have the opportunity to visit those cities at some point during my presidency,\" Mr. Obama said in 2009. The calculus for a visit is particularly complicated for Mr. Obama. Political opponents have often falsely accused him of undertaking an \"apology tour\" of world capitals in his first year in office, so anything that even hints at atonement would feed that criticism. Obama itches for Trump fight THE HILL \/\/ JORDAN FABIAN President Obama can't wait to take on Donald Trump. Obama has been largely sidelined in the presidential contest, a last-year officeholder with high approval ratings who has repeatedly shown he likes to spar with political foes. With Bernie Sanders continuing to slug it out with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama largely has to choose his openings to talk 2016. So on Friday, when the White House announced Obama would make a statement about the economy, the president knew he'd get asked about Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. And when he did, Obama was ready. \"We are in serious times, and this is a really serious job,\" Obama said. \"This is not entertainment; this is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States.\" The remarks previewed a part of the Obama-Clinton strategy against Trump: that he is untested and not ready for the White House, and that the GOP and media have fallen down on the job by failing to properly vet him. The remarks also reflect the urgency Obama feels about defeating Trump. Keeping the White House in Democratic hands, no matter who became the Republican nominee, has always been an important goal for Obama. The war against the Islamic State hits hurdles just as the U.S. military gears up WASHINGTON POST \/\/ LIZ SLY After months of unexpectedly swift advances, the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State is running into hurdles on and off the battlefield that call into question whether the pace of recent gains can be sustained. Chaos in Baghdad, the fraying of the cease-fire in Syria and political turmoil in Turkey are among some of the potential obstacles that have emerged in recent weeks to complicate the prospects for progress. Others include small setbacks for U.S.-allied forces on front lines in northern Iraq and Syria, which have come as a reminder that a strategy heavily reliant on local armed groups of varying proficiency who are often at odds with one another won't always work. When President Obama first ordered U.S. warplanes into action against the extremists sweeping through Iraq and Syria in 2014, U.S. officials put a three- to five-year timeline on a battle they predicted would be hard. After a rocky start, officials say they are gratified by the progress made, especially over the past six months. One Big Piece Of Obama's Legacy: A Park System That Looks Like All Of Us HUFFINGTON POST \/\/ KATE SHEPPARD President Barack Obama is expected to declare the Stonewall Inn a national monument in the coming weeks. Stonewall, located in Greenwich Village, New York, is known as the birthplace of the gay rights movement. In June 1969, the bar's patrons fought back against repeated harassment and police raids, sparking other riots and protests against the criminalization of gay people. Officials from the Department of Interior will hold a listening session on Monday on the proposal to recognize Stonewall. It's expected to be finalized as soon as next month, The Washington Post reported last week. The site will be the first national monument recognizing the gay rights movement, and it's part of the Obama administration's ongoing effort to diversity the sites in the National Park System. Under the Antiquities Act of 1906 \u2014 signed into law by Republican Theodore Roosevelt \u2014 the president has the power to designate national monuments, thus granting federal protection to areas of historic or natural significance. A monument is a separate designation from a national park (only Congress can create a park), but it grants special protections. Panama Papers data set for public release THE HILL \/\/ CYRA MASTER A journalist group on Monday will release a large swath of documents that are part of the Panama Papers, AFP reported Sunday. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) will release the documents in a searchable database accessible to the public at offshoreleaks.icij.org. The U.S.-based group said the release \"will not be a 'data dump'\" like those that gained attention at Wikileaks. But it will reveal names and information about 200,000 offshore entities set up by wealthy people worldwide. The data came from digital archives of Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that specialized in creating and running offshore entities, which it says were hacked. The law firm on Thursday issued a \"cease and desist\" letter to the journalist group, saying putting up the information publicly would violate attorney-client privilege. But the group says it is important the public be able to see the information. \"We think that information about who owns the company should be public and transparent,\" Marina Walker Guevara, deputy director of the ICIJ, told CNN. Why Middle Eastern Leaders Are Talking to Putin, Not Obama POLITICO \/\/ DENNIS ROSS The United States has significantly more military capability in the Middle East today than Russia\u2014America has 35,000 troops and hundreds of aircraft; the Russians roughly 2,000 troops and, perhaps, 50 aircraft\u2014and yet Middle Eastern leaders are making pilgrimages to Moscow to see Vladimir Putin these days, not rushing to Washington. Two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to see the Russian president, his second trip to Russia since last fall, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia is planning a trip soon. Egypt's president and other Middle Eastern leaders have also made the trek to see Putin. Why is this happening, and why on my trips to the region am I hearing that Arabs and Israelis have pretty much given up on President Barack Obama? Because perceptions matter more than mere power: The Russians are seen as willing to use power to affect the balance of power in the region, and we are not. Powerful Policy Maker Believes the Fed's on the Right Track NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM William C. Dudley, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York president, who helped pilot the Fed's post-crisis stimulus campaign, sounded pretty calm about the nation's current economic situation. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Dudley said he foresaw continued growth despite bumps in the early months of the year \u2014 enough growth for the Fed to get back to slowly raising its benchmark interest rate. And if growth should falter, he said, there is plenty of medicine in the Fed's chest. It remains a \"reasonable expectation\" that the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate twice this year, Mr. Dudley said. \"I think the general story of the economy over the last few years is very much intact,\" he said during the conversation at the New York Fed's ornate fortress in Lower Manhattan. \"I think we're still on track.\" The Fed in recent months has faced some criticism that it moved prematurely by raising rates in December for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. In the months after the move, both domestic and global growth weakened unexpectedly, and volatility increased across a wide range of financial markets. Trump and the Obama Effect WALL STREET JOURNAL \/\/ L. GORDON CROVITZ Top presidential advisers often go public as administrations end, but there has rarely been a disclosure as illuminating as how President Obama's top spin doctor helped turn American foreign policy upside down. In a New York Times Magazine article this weekend headlined \"The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama's Foreign Policy Guru: How Ben Rhodes Rewrote the Rules of Diplomacy for the Digital Age,\" writer David Samuels details how Mr. Rhodes, a former speechwriter, sold the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran by creating a false claim of \"moderate\" Iranian officials. Mr. Rhodes brags about keeping Mr. Obama's long-standing plan to elevate Iran over allies such as Israel and the Gulf States hidden from the public by manipulating liberal journalists and think-tank analysts and using the short attention span of social media to obfuscate the truth. Close Encounters With Jets Show Russia's Anger at NATO Buildup, U.S. Says NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ HELENE COOPER When the Pentagon complained about a Russian fighter plane performing a barrel roll near an Air Force reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on April 29, a quick response came from Moscow, which claimed that the American plane did not have its transponder turned on. \"The U.S. Air Force has two solutions,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a sharp statement. \"Either not to fly near our borders or to turn the transponder on for identification.\" (American officials said the transponder had, indeed, been turned on.) With that, American officials and foreign policy experts said, Russia delivered its response to President Obama's decision this year to substantially increase the deployment of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and other equipment to NATO countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The move is meant to deter Russia from further aggression in the region. By sharply ramping up so-called intercepts of American ships and planes in Central and Eastern Europe, Russia is demonstrating its anger over the increased American military presence in a region it considers part of its backyard, White House officials said. They called the Russian actions harassment. Congress says no Puerto Rico bailout, but tax deal beat it to the punch POLITICO \/\/ BRIAN FALER Lawmakers say they absolutely, positively will not bail out Puerto Rico, but here's the thing: The federal government already is bailing out Puerto Rico. The Obama administration effectively has been providing the beleaguered island with billions of dollars in aid through a little-noticed and convoluted tax arrangement. With the help of a Washington law firm, Puerto Rico in 2010 created a special corporate levy aimed at getting money out of the U.S. Treasury, and the IRS has refused to rule on whether it's legitimate. U.S. companies located on the island act as middlemen: First they pay taxes to the commonwealth, and then they are made whole when they claim foreign tax credits from the U.S. The aid, which in some years amounts to more than 20 percent of Puerto Rico's budget, was never approved by Congress, and some analysts question whether the arrangement is constitutional. They say it amounts to just the sort of bailout lawmakers now working on a rescue package have forsworn. Democrats Va. governor: Order restoring voting rights to felons 'morally the right thing' THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) called his executive order that extends voting rights to more than 200,000 convicted felons \"morally the right thing to do.\" \"They're back in the community. They've served their debts to society. Why do we want people to continue to be second-class citizens?\" McAuliffe said in an interview with radio show host John Catsimatidis that aired Sunday. Last month, McAuliffe issued the order that reverses Civil War-era provisions in Virginia's Constitution. It only applies to convicted felons who have served their prison time and finished any parole. He said prohibiting felons from voting in the state mostly disenfranchises African-Americans. Maine and Vermont are the only two states without voting restrictions on felons. Virginia, Kentucky, Florida and Iowa are among the states that impose the harshest restrictions. Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ CECILIA KANG Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption. In a string of meetings with members of Congress, Mr. Vance told central lawmakers that encryption needed to be diminished during criminal investigations. During a 45-minute session with Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Vance said his office had 230 iPhones that might contain crucial information for cases but were useless because Apple refused to help the police break the encryption on the devices. \"I wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\" Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit. A day after Mr. Vance was on Capitol Hill, tech executives including Kent Walker, the general counsel of Google, and Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, also met with lawmakers \u2014 but with a very different message on encryption. Tech executives at the meetings said they were concerned about any laws that would force companies to weaken the security of their technology, according to news officials representing these companies. Democrats Intend to Turn Up Pressure on Charles Grassley Over Merrick Garland NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ CARL HULSE With the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland stalled, Senate Democrats and their allies in the advocacy community have some surprises in store this week for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee and who has ignored calls to convene a hearing on the nomination. As the Senate returns from a week off, Democrats intend to step up efforts to make Mr. Grassley the poster boy for refusing to act on President Obama's nomination of Judge Garland. Those efforts will include the release of a report critical of the work of the Judiciary Committee under Mr. Grassley. On Wednesday, Senate Democrats will host a news conference with a group of former Grassley supporters brought in from Iowa who have changed their views on the senator. They will also highlight polls showing that Mr. Grassley, who was thought to be breezing to a seventh term, has been hurt more than other Republicans by his position on Judge Garland, though he remains favored to win his race. Republicans Flake mulls Garland nomination if White House win is in doubt THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Sunday that his colleagues should approve President Obama's Supreme Court nominee if it appears the Republican Party will lose the White House in November, softening his stance on Judge Merrick Garland, who was nominated by Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \"If we come to a point, I've said all along, where we're going to lose the election, or we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him quickly,\" Flake said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Because I'm certain that he'll be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination come January.\" Flake is one of the few Senate Republicans to have met with Garland and called him a \"man of accomplishment\" who has \"keen intellect.\" The Arizona senator, however, had previously said the next president should pick the nominee. GOP rallies around court blockade POLITICO \/\/ BURGESS EVERETT Democrats are getting badly outspent by their conservative rivals in the war over Merrick Garland's confirmation, suggesting that President Barack Obama's closest allies in the Supreme Court battle have more bark than bite. The Constitutional Responsibility Project \u2014 which is taking the lead in the Democratic PR push over the court \u2014 has spent about $150,000 on two ads knocking Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania for stonewalling Garland's nomination, according to two media tracking sources. That's a pittance compared to the Koch-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network, which has already spent $4.5 million to bolster vulnerable Republicans and attack moderate Democrats for urging action on Garland. The muscular spending from GOP-backed groups shows how dug-in conservatives are over their Garland blockade, and has helped keep almost all Senate Republicans moving in lockstep. Other than a series of perfunctory meetings with Republicans, parliamentary progress on Garland has been completely stopped. Now, with many Senate races shifting from primaries toward the general election, the battles for control of the Senate and filling the Supreme Court seat have become tightly intertwined. Ted Cruz at a Crossroads as He Returns to the Senate NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ JENNIFER STEINHAUER Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is expected to return to the Capitol this week, the last of four Republican senators battered and beaten by Donald J. Trump to trudge back to the world of meetings over cafeteria cod and roll call votes to name the national mammal. But Mr. Cruz's return is more fraught with curiosity than those of the other three, Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida. He made it the furthest, winning 10 states and coming tantalizingly close to pushing Mr. Trump to a contested convention, only to drop out on the same day the billionaire developer suggested that Mr. Cruz's father had conspired with Lee Harvey Oswald. The party's presumptive nominee had also insulted Mr. Cruz's wife, baselessly alluded to extramarital affairs and labeled him \"Lyin' Ted.\" Now the man who helped create an outsider movement in national politics, only to have it eat him alive by the co-opter of that idea, must decide which group among his fellow lawmakers to join. Will he stand with the hold-your-nose set, as Mr. Paul has done, and support Mr. Trump? Or join forces with \"Never Trump,\" as Senator Graham did on Friday, and publicly decline to get on board? Palin backing Ryan's challenger THE HILL \/\/ KYLE BALLUCK Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) said in an interview to be broadcast Sunday that it was \"not a wise decision\" for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to withhold his support for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. \"His political career is over but for a miracle, because he has so disrespected the American people,\" Palin said of Ryan on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"It kind of screws his chances for the 2020 presidential bid that he's gunning for,\" she said. Paul, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's 2012 running mate, said last Thursday he is \"just not ready\" to support the real estate mogul. \"I think Paul Ryan is soon to be 'Cantored,' as in Eric Cantor,\" Palin, who ran with John McCain on the Republican ticket in 2008, added. Cantor, the former House majority leader, lost his primary bid in Virginia in 2014. \"I will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen,\" Palin said of Ryan's primary challenger. Sarah Palin says Paul Ryan will soon be 'Cantored' WASHINGTON POST \/\/ SEAN SULLIVAN Sarah Palin said in a television interview broadcast Sunday that she will support Speaker Paul Ryan's primary challenger, and she compared Ryan to former House majority leader Eric Cantor (Va.), who was stunningly defeated in a 2014 primary. \"I think Paul Ryan is soon to be 'Cantored,'\" Palin said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Cantor lost his primary to now-Rep. Dave Brat. Palin, a former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, backs Donald Trump for president. Ryan said this week that he is not ready to support Trump \u2014 even though he is the presumptive GOP nominee. Trump and Ryan are slated to meet this week. His political career is over but for a miracle, because he has so disrespected the will of the people ... and for him to already come out and say who he will not support was not a wise decision of his,\" Palin added of Ryan. GOP likely to revoke Nevada's early-state status POLITICO \/\/ KYLE CHENEY Nevada is likely to lose its place as the first Western state to vote in the Republican presidential nomination contest, several GOP leaders tell POLITICO. For three successive elections, the state has been grouped in the vaunted class of early-voting states, joining Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina as the bellwethers that garner the most attention from presidential candidates and help winnow voters' choices. But for the third straight primary season, Nevada's caucuses have been wracked by embarrassing procedural errors, low turnout, confusion among attendees and questions about the integrity of the process. Republican National Committee members say there's growing momentum behind an effort to strip Nevada of its early place in line \u2014 handing it instead to either Colorado or Arizona. \"The long knives are out for Nevada,\" said one RNC committeeman. \"Nevada does nothing for us.\" The review of the state's pecking order is likely to be just one piece of the GOP's wholesale review of a nominating process that just produced one of the most acrimonious primary seasons in memory and ended with Donald Trump as the party's nominee. McConnell faces tough decision on criminal justice bill THE HILL \/\/ JORDAIN CARNEY Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is under increasing pressure to bring up a revised criminal justice bill despite staunch opposition from conservatives in his own caucus. The Republican leader has been careful not to take a side on the legislation, even though his second-in-command, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), is one of the bill's chief supporters. The normally tight-lipped McConnell will need to walk a fine line as he weighs his decision: Is it worth potentially netting another bipartisan victory ahead of the election \u2014 when Republicans have to defend 24 Senate seats \u2014 if it would put divisions within his own party under a spotlight? In addition to vocal pushback from a handful of GOP senators \u2014 including firebrands such as Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Ted Cruz (Texas) \u2014 it could put Senate Republicans on a collision course with Donald Trump. The GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, not known for policy specifics, hasn't weighed in on the Senate's bill; however, his previous law-and-order leanings are at odds with the legislation. NC governor: Feds gave us 'unrealistic' bathroom law deadline THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said the federal government gave the state an \"unrealistic\" deadline to respond to a letter informing him that the state's bathroom law violates the Civil Rights Act. \"They gave the ninth-largest state in the United States ... three working days to respond to a pretty complex letter and to a pretty big threat,\" McCrory said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We don't think three working days is enough to respond to such a threat.\" McCrory said he asked for an extension on Friday. The Justice Department sent a letter to the governor that says the law violates protections against workplace discrimination based on sex. It gave the governor until Monday to confirm \"that the State will not comply with or implement HB2.\" Many people in support of LGBT rights condemned the law in North Carolina, which requires transgender people to use public bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex. McCrory said in an interview Sunday that the Justice Department agreed to give a one-week extension if the governor admits that the language in the bathroom law does discriminate. In Arizona Senate Race, McCain Contends With Trump's Influence WALL STREET JOURNAL \/\/ KRISTINA PETERSON Sen. John McCain walked into Ping Inc.'s headquarters on a campaign stop here last week and immediately thanked the Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrants who help manufacture its golf clubs. \"I'm grateful that you all are here,\" he said. \"That's what America is all about.\" Minutes later the Arizona Republican reiterated his support for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whose militant immigration stance has polarized voters, particularly in border states such as Arizona. \"I support the nominee of the party,\" Mr. McCain said, while predicting the state's voters would separate his record from the businessman's provocative stances. \"I'm running my own campaign and the people of Arizona know me.\" Mr. McCain entered his campaign for a sixth Senate term as the clear favorite in a state that has elected him for more than three decades. But the party's 2008 presidential nominee is now almost certain to be in the difficult position of running on the GOP ticket below a man who has clashed with him on immigration, national security, torture and even diminished his time as a prisoner of war. North Carolina Governor Won't Concede That Transgender Law Is Biased NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ ALAN BLINDER Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina is expected to respond on Monday to the Justice Department's warning that a new state law limiting the rights of transgender people is illegal, after he and the federal government failed to reach an agreement that would have allowed him to postpone his reply. Mr. McCrory said that he could not assent to the Justice Department's condition for a one-week extension \u2014 an acknowledgment by him that the law is discriminatory \u2014 and would answer by 5 p.m. on Monday. \"I'm not going to publicly announce that something discriminates, which is agreeing with their letter, because we're really talking about a letter in which they're trying to define gender identity, and there is no clear definition of gender identity,\" Mr. McCrory, a Republican who is seeking re-election this year, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"It's the federal government being a bully.\" The governor said that he was \"discussing all of our legal options, all of our political options,\" and he appeared to rule out the possibility that he would take some kind of independent action to undo the law, or at least limit its enforcement, as some people have suggested. For Merrick Garland and Republicans, a Tango of Praise and Rejection NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ EMMARIE HUETTEMAN Unfailingly punctual, he enters the office without a word. He shakes hands with staff members who rise hastily from their desks, and studies the home state curios on the walls. He is ushered in behind closed doors, and within the hour he leaves as quietly as he came, occasionally slipping out a back exit with his retinue. Then comes the statement, from one Republican senator after another: I had a pleasant visit with Judge Merrick B. Garland. He is an intelligent, talented jurist. However, I cannot support considering his nomination to the Supreme Court. With this tango of praise and rejection, the once sacrosanct process of filling a Supreme Court seat has taken a surreal turn. In the past, even eyebrow-raising nominees received a hearing and a vote. But Senate Republican leaders have said for nearly two months that Judge Garland, a relatively uncontroversial nominee, will get neither. White House officials have not blinked in this staring contest. They have scheduled meetings with any senator who will return their messages \u2014 46 to date, including 14 Republicans. This to-and-fro has left Judge Garland, broadly regarded as a leading legal mind, looking a little like the earnest leaflet-clutching visitors who hope to raise awareness for their cause and grab a sandwich in the Senate cafeteria. The situation seems poised to grow only more complicated, with Donald J. Trump wearing the fire-engine-red baseball cap of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. 2016 Democrats Decision time for FBI on Clinton THE HILL \/\/ JULIAN HATTEM The FBI investigation swirling around Hillary Clinton's presidential run appears to have entered its final stages. Many of the former secretary of State's top aides have been interviewed over the course of the last month, and Clinton herself is expected to answer investigators' questions about her use of a private email server in the coming days or weeks. Former officials and legal experts say the Democratic front-runner's testimony will likely be the final puzzle piece for federal prosecutors and FBI investigators as they decide whether to file any charges over her use of a personal email server while secretary of State. \"This certainly sends the signal that they are nearing an end to their investigation,\" said Steven Levin, a former federal prosecutor and current partner at the law firm Levin & Curlett. Though FBI officials have said Clinton is not the target of the probe, they would want to be as prepared as possible before going in to interview her, Levin said. The year of the hated: Clinton and Trump, two intensely disliked candidates, begin their face-off WASHINGTON POST \/\/ DAVID WEIGEL In the end, it was the voters of Indiana last week who effectively gave the country the outcome that had loomed for months. The 2016 election will likely put Hillary Clinton, who is disliked by a majority of voters, against Donald Trump, disliked by another and more intense majority of voters. If the rise of Trump has no obvious precedent, neither does an election like this. Clinton, whose buoyant favorable ratings in the State Department convinced some Democrats that she could win easily, is now viewed as unfavorably as George W. Bush was in his close 2004 reelection bid. Trump is even less liked, with negative ratings among nonwhite voters not seen since the 1964 campaign of Barry Goldwater. \"In the history of polling, we've basically never had a candidate viewed negatively by half of the electorate,\" wrote Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) in a widely shared note that asked someone, anyone, to mount a third-party run. \"There are dumpster fires in my town more popular than these two 'leaders.' \" Clinton: No contact from FBI in email server investigation THE HILL \/\/ KYLE BALLUCK Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said in an interview broadcast Sunday that she has not been in contact with the FBI over its investigation into the private email server she used while secretary of State. \"No one has reached out to me yet, but last summer, I think last August, I made it clear I'm more than ready to talk to anybody, anytime,\" she said on CBS's \"Face the Nation. \"And I've encouraged \u2026 all of \u2026 my assistants \u2026 to be \u2026 very forthcoming. And I hope that this is close to being wrapped up.\" \"So nobody said, 'Hillary Clinton, we'd like to sit down and talk to you' from the FBI?\" host John Dickerson asked. \"Not at this point,\" Clinton responded. Many of the former secretary of State's top aides have been interviewed in the past few weeks, as the FBI investigation appears to have entered its final stages. Clinton herself is expected to answer questions in the coming days or weeks. Clinton said she would tell voters concerned about the issues what she has said \"for many, many months.\" Clinton Threads Needle With Pitches to Sanders Fans, Republicans BLOOMBERG \/\/ BEN BRODY Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said she sees \"a great role\" for Bernie Sanders and his supporters in a \"unified party,\" even as she said she welcomed Republicans who are not supporting presumptive nominee Donald Trump. Days after Trump's remaining Republican competitors exited the race, the former secretary of state continues to battle for her party's nomination against the Vermont senator, who has taken several positions to her left on economic issues. \"Obviously I'm reaching out to Democrats, Republicans, independents, all voters who want a candidate who is running a campaign based on issues,\" Clinton said in an interview with CBS's \"Face the Nation\" broadcast on Sunday. Clinton said she and Sanders have similar views on issues, including raising the minimum wage and reining \"in bad actors on Wall Street and in corporate America.\" She said she wants to unify Democrats around those issues. \"I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share,\" she said. Hillary Clinton Says She Is Available for F.B.I. Interviews Over Emails NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ ALEXANDER BURNS Hillary Clinton said Sunday that the F.B.I. had not asked to interview her as part of its inquiry into her use of a personal email server as secretary of state. But Mrs. Clinton reiterated on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that she would make herself available to law enforcement officials as necessary. The investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email practices and her handling of classified intelligence has shadowed her presidential campaign, and CNN reported last week that she was likely to be interviewed soon by the F.B.I. Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday that no meeting had been requested or scheduled. \"No one has reached out to me yet,\" she said, adding, \"I made it clear that I'm more than ready to talk to anybody, anytime, and I've encouraged all of my assistants to be very forthcoming.\" As she has done in the past, Mrs. Clinton said she had erred in setting up a private email server but said she \"always took classified material seriously.\" But Mrs. Clinton also sought to turn around the scrutiny she was facing, arguing that it was time for the Republican candidate Donald J. Trump to face similar examination. Mr. Trump, she noted, had not released his tax returns, as is customary for presidential candidates. For Clinton, beating Trump isn't a slam dunk CNN \/\/ JULIAN ZELIZER There are many reasons why Democrats should feel good about the election now that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. Even before GOP voters went for Trump, the Electoral College math tended to favor the Democrats. Republicans will be playing catch up. Trump has also deeply divided the Republican Party, with many of the most prominent leaders refusing to endorse him. Usually when parties divide this badly they lose. Unlike almost any other Republican in the current age of polarization, Trump has the potential to generate a backlash of Republican voters against their own party, causing them to either stay home on Election Day or, even worse for the party, consider voting for the Democratic nominee. Yet with all of these advantages, Democrats should be extremely careful about becoming overconfident. There are many reasons that Democrats should fear Trump and anticipate a campaign that is much closer and much tougher than they are expecting. For Clinton, the general election is about married women. Starting in swing-state Virginia. WASHINGTON POST \/\/ ANNE GEARAN In the fight for the votes of suburban women, there is no more representative place than Loudoun County, the ticket-splitting bedroom community in swing-state Virginia that Hillary Clinton will visit Monday \u2014 and no better foil for her argument, perhaps, than Donald Trump. Affluent suburban women are a key audience for Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, as she seeks to use Trump's polarizing statements about women, immigrants and others against him. Clinton will hold a discussion about jobs, schools and other concerns in a bellwether county that narrowly supported President Obama's reelection in 2012 and helped elect a Republican critic of Obama, Rep. Barbara Comstock, to Congress two years later. Comstock has disavowed Trump but isn't backing Clinton. The presidential candidate is hoping that women who think much as Comstock does about national security, the role of government and women's equality will make that leap, though, and help her win Virginia. Financial Sector Gives Hillary Clinton a Boost WALL STREET JOURNAL \/\/ BRODY MULLINS AND REBECCA BALLHAUS Hillary Clinton is consolidating her support among Wall Street donors and other businesses ahead of a general-election battle with Donald Trump, winning more campaign contributions from financial-services executives in the most recent fundraising period than all other candidates combined. The Democratic front-runner has raised $4.2 million in total from Wall Street, $344,000 of which was contributed in March alone. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of fundraising data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the former secretary of state received 53% of the donations from Wall Street in March, up from 32% last year and 33% in January through February, as the nominating contests began. The analysis of campaign-finance reports shows that some Wall Street donors have shifted their financial support from Republican candidates who dropped out of the race, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to Mrs. Clinton in recent months. Clinton explains 'loose cannon' attack on Trump POLITICO \/\/ AUSTIN WRIGHT Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton explained her oft-repeated line that Donald Trump is a \"loose cannon\" in a pre-taped interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that focused much more on the presumptive GOP nominee than Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. \"Being a loose cannon means saying that other nations should go ahead and acquire nuclear weapons for themselves \u2014 when that is the last thing we need in the world today,\" Clinton said in the interview, airing Sunday. \"Being a loose cannon is saying we should pull out of NATO \u2014 the strongest military alliance in the history of the world, and something that we really need to modernize, but not abandon.\" Clinton was referencing remarks Trump has made suggesting Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than relying on the United States to defend them against North Korea. Trump has also questioned the continued existence of NATO, calling the 28-nation alliance \"obsolete.\" Clinton: Trump's GOP critics 'respect' the office THE HILL \/\/ KYLE BALLUCK Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said in an interview broadcast Sunday that Republican criticism of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is not \"personal\" but \"rooted in\" critics' \"respect for the office.\" \"I have to say the Republicans themselves are raising questions about their presumptive nominee. And I think that's in large measure ... because they do understand how hard the job of being president is,\" Clinton told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"When you have former presidents, when you have high-ranking Republican officials in Congress raising questions about their nominee, I don't think it's personal so much as rooted in their respect for the office and their deep concern about what kind of leader he would be.\" Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last Thursday said he is \"just not ready\" to support Trump, who became the presumptive nominee with a win in Indiana's primary, knocking rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich out of the race. Other high-profile Republicans have vowed never to back the real estate mogul. Clinton camp: Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit wealthiest THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton's campaign on Sunday slammed Donald Trump's tax plan, saying it would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans. \"Don't believe Donald Trump's weak attempts at a general election 'makeover' for even a second,\" Clinton's deputy communications director, Christina Reynolds, said in a statement. \"Trump's economic plans take direct aim at working Americans \u2014 his proposal to cut trillions in taxes for the top one percent would almost certainly come at the expense of working and middle class families. Americans just can't afford Trump's economic plans.\" Citizens for Tax Justice said under Trump's proposed tax plan, the top 1 percent of Americans would get 34 percent of the tax cuts, according to a release. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the presumptive GOP nominee's plan would create \"extremely large and unprecedented tax-cut windfalls\" for millionaires which would come \"almost certainly\" at the expense of low and middle income households. Trump said an interview broadcast Sunday there will be changes to his tax plan after negotiations. Clinton's wonky policies of fine-grained complexity contrast with rivals' grandiose ideas WASHINGTON POST \/\/ DAVID A. FAHRENTHOLD Hillary Clinton's official campaign platform is now twice as long as \"Hamlet\": seventy-three thousand six hundred forty-five words of policy ideas. One hundred seventy-four pages. And growing. But, at its heart, this wordy list amounts to a statement of Clinton's confidence in two things. The status quo. And the federal bureaucracy. The other two candidates left in this presidential race want to overhaul American government. Clinton mainly wants to tinker with its parts. In many cases, her plans involve adding small \u2014 but intricate \u2014 new tasks for the bureaucracy, designed to make government smarter, more generous and more just. To crack down on Wall Street, for instance, Clinton would expand a particular regulatory form. The form already is 42 pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out. If Congress doesn't overhaul immigration, Clinton's plan is to allow undocumented residents to walk into local federal offices and ask for help. Already-busy bureaucrats \u2014 armed with guidelines that nobody has written yet \u2014 would make millions of new decisions about who can stay. This approach says a lot about Clinton's worldview, after 23 years in and around Washington. To her, complexity is realism. Oil magnate: 'I'm amused' by Clinton wanting to move away from fossil fuels THE HILL \/\/ EVELYN RUPERT Oil mogul T. Boone Pickens slammed Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton for her saying she wants to move the country away from fossil fuels. \"I'm amused when I hear last night Hillary Clinton says we are going to get rid of coal. We're going to get rid of all fossil fuels,\" Pickens said in an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis that aired Sunday. \"You want to stop the music at that point and say, 'Look, what are you going to replace it with?' She has no idea.\" Clinton has said the U.S. should \"move away\" from coal and all the other fossil fuels. \"You get rid of fossil fuels, and you'll stop the world,\" Pickens said. \"That's the only thing that's going to move that 18-wheeler, is diesel or natural gas.\" Dem convention host: Sanders supporters better 'behave themselves' when he loses THE HILL \/\/ HARPER NEIDIG The chairman of the Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee for this summer's Democratic National Convention said supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders have to \"behave themselves\" when the Vermont senator loses the nomination. During a radio interview with John Catsimatidis, Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and Democratic National Committee chairman, laid out his vision for how the convention would play out. \"I think it's gonna be a great convention, but of course the key to it is the Sanders people. Bernie's gonna have his name placed in nomination; we're gonna have a roll call; there's gonna be a demonstration in support of Bernie; he's gonna lose the roll call,\" he said. \"His supporters have to behave and not cause trouble. And I think they will, and I think Sen. Sanders will send them a strong message.\" Sanders is trailing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by 774 total delegates. Clinton is just 155 delegates from clinching the nomination. Democrats, don't celebrate Trump's nomination. Fear it. WASHINGTON POST \/\/ FRED HIATT I know the polls say Donald Trump cannot win. But what if we are looking at the wrong poll question? What if Trump's overwhelming negatives don't matter? Or, to put it another way, what if the country's negatives matter more? Right now, about 6 in 10 Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, and only 36 percent view him positively. But the country is faring even worse. In the most recent average of polls calculated by RealClearPolitics, 26.9 percent of Americans think the nation is headed in the right direction and 64.9 percent think we are heading down the wrong track. So what if even voters who respect Hillary Clinton's competence reject her as the embodiment of business as usual? And what if even voters who do not like Trump's bigotry or bluster care more that he will, in their view, shake things up? Sure, these voters might tell themselves, he may be crude, or inconsistent, or ill-informed. He may insult women and Hispanics and other groups. But it's part of a shtick. He probably doesn't mean half of it. He's just an entertainer. The desire to send a message of disgust or disapproval, in other words, could lead voters to overlook, discount, wish away or excuse many Trump sins. Clinton's Bid for Democratic Unity a Tough Sell Among Some Sanders Supporters BLOOMBERG \/\/ MARGARET TALEV AND ARIT JOHN With every pledge to unify the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton is acknowledging one of her biggest challenges between now and November: getting millions of Bernie Sanders' fans to give her their votes. The Clinton campaign is still trying to figure out exactly what Sanders wants in exchange for rallying his supporters to her side. In recent weeks, he's suggested that Clinton can't expect them to just fall in line, but he hasn't enumerated exactly what he believes would draw them in. He hasn't said which of his policy positions is most important for her to adopt or at least shift closer toward, or what other moves she could make that would satisfy him. With 13 nominating contests still to go, and Sanders vowing to fight on, Clinton's campaign is taking a soft-sell approach, and waiting for a clear signal of intentions from the Vermont Senator. GOP operatives on the prowl for secret Clinton transcripts THE HILL \/\/ JONATHAN SWAN Republican operatives are scouring the country for transcripts, notes or secret recordings of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs in hopes of finding damaging material for the general election. Clinton has rebuffed calls from Bernie Sanders to release the transcripts of her three speeches to the Wall Street giant, which she delivered in 2013 to the tune of $225,000 per appearance. She has repeatedly said she will release the transcripts of her paid speeches when all the presidential candidates agree to do so. Republican opposition researchers have taken matters into their own hands, aggressively seeking any information about the speeches, including from Goldman employees who were in the room. Ian Prior, the communications director for the well-funded Republican group American Crossroads, said information about the Goldman Sachs speeches could prove cataclysmic for the Democratic Party. Finding and releasing the transcripts \"would be a heck of a way to outflank Hillary on her left [in a general election] and stop Bernie's supporters from voting for her,\" he said. \"Just mail the Goldman Sachs transcripts to every Bernie supporter. There's your targeted mail program right there.\" Clinton's campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Her team has never disputed that Clinton, as part of her contracts for the speeches, required that they not be taped in any form. The contracts also stated that the transcriptions would be kept solely in her possession. While the hunt for the transcripts is on, Republican operatives acknowledge they've come up empty so far. 2016 Republicans Manafort: 'We have plenty of time to put the party together' THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY Donald Trump's convention manager, Paul Manafort, said it will take time for the Republican Party to unite behind the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. \"To expect everyone to come together the day after the primary process ended, it was a bit unrealistic,\" Manafort said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But, frankly, I'm very pleased to say that it's happening even faster than we thought.\" Manafort said Republican leaders in Washington were saying a week ago there was going to be a contested convention. When Trump won the Indiana primary last Tuesday, he added, the race ended \"much sooner than anybody expected, except maybe the people supporting Donald Trump.\" Following Trump's win, the candidate's former rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, ended their presidential bids. \"So Washington was in a little bit of an uncertain phase ... but it's a healing process that will happen over time,\" Manafort said. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said last week he was \"just not ready\" to support Trump. Several other Republican leaders have come out since and said they don't plan to support Trump as the nominee of their party. The GOP's electoral-map problem is not about Trump. It's about demographics. WASHINGTON POST \/\/ CHRIS CILLIZZA Republicans have a major electoral-map problem in November. Major. Donald Trump's victory last week in Indiana's primary not only effectively sealed the GOP nomination for the real estate billionaire but also brought into sharp relief how difficult it will be for any Republican to get to 270 electoral votes and beat Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president this fall. Start here: Eighteen states plus the District of Columbia have voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election between 1992 and 2012. Add them up, and you get 242 electoral votes. By contrast, 13 states have voted for the Republican presidential nominee in each of the past six elections. Total them up and you get 102 electoral votes. There are two important takeaways from these facts: The generic Democratic nominee starts with an electoral vote lead of 140, and the Democratic nominee needs to find only 28 votes beyond that reliable base to win the presidency. Donald Trump breaks the GOP POLITICO \/\/ ELI STOKOLS It was as shocking as it was predictable after a year of slow-motion build-up\u2014the dramatic splitting apart of the Grand Old Party in the 72 hours after Donald Trump became its presumptive nominee. When asked Friday if the organization he now leads is officially Trump's party, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus responded with pithy double-speak befitting this dystopian moment in our politics. \"It's the party's party,\" Priebus said. Whatever party Priebus was speaking of is currently in tatters. There is no more denying that Trump will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee. But there is still plenty of denial when it comes to accepting the more fundamental issue at hand: that the fractious coalition of conservatives that we used to know as the Republican Party is, after a decade of fraying ties between the Washington-based establishment and its base, is now comprised of two separate coalitions. There are those mainstream conservatives still tethered to the party's ideological history of limited government, free trade and a hawkish foreign policy; and there is the conservative base that is increasingly resentful of elites of all stripes, voters unmoored from ideology and drawn to Trump's charisma, fearlessness and a populist, angry brand of neo-nationalism. 'There's nobody left': Evangelicals feel abandoned by GOP after Trump's ascent WASHINGTON POST \/\/ KATIE ZEZIMA Pastor Gary Fuller planned a Sunday service heavy on politics, including a speech by the pastor father of Sen. Ted Cruz. But after a week when Cruz abruptly dropped out of the race, his father scrapped his appearance here and Donald Trump became the Republican Party's standard bearer, a dismayed Fuller kept the political portion short. \"Vote according to your convictions,\" Fuller told congregants at Gentle Shepherd Baptist Church who will cast ballots in Nebraska's presidential primary Tuesday. \"What you believe is the right thing to vote for, according to the scriptures.\" Fuller told congregants that the church can't and won't promote one candidate over another. But he has already cast an early ballot for Cruz and has a hard time stomaching Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee. \"In a sense, we feel abandoned by our party,\" he said. \"There's nobody left.\" Johnson sees third-party candidacy as 'opportunity' THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson said in an interview on Sunday he sees a third-party candidacy as an opportunity, instead of as a threat. \"Well, I think it is a real opportunity. I do think that [Hillary] Clinton and [Donald] Trump are the two most polarizing figures in politics today,\" Johnson, who is expected to win the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination later this year, said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"And when 50 percent of Americans now declare themselves as independent, I happen to think that they're libertarian; it's just that they don't know it,\" he continued. \"Look, fiscally responsible, fiscally conservative, small government and then individual choices \u2014 freedom, liberty. Persons should be making choices in their own lives, not the government.\" Johnson noted he doesn't think he'd take more votes from Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, than from Clinton, the Democratic front-runner. \"It draws from both sides and \u2014 and at the end of the day, 50 percent of Americans say they're independent,\" he said. Trump: Bush, Graham made a pledge POLITICO \/\/ AUSTIN WRIGHT Presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said two of his now-vanquished challengers, Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham, made pledges to support the eventual nominee \u2014 and their decisions not to endorse him were \"a question of honor.\" \"Jeb Bush signed a pledge \u2014 a binding pledge,\" Trump said in a pre-taped interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"Lindsey Graham signed a binding pledge that they would endorse. That they would support and endorse. That's what it says. Now they're breaking. You know, that's a question of honor.\" In the interview airing Sunday, Trump also said he was \"blindsided\" by House Speaker Paul Ryan's announcement last week that he wasn't ready to endorse the real-estate mogul. \"I was blindsided a little bit, because he spoke to me three weeks ago, and it was a very nice call, a very encouraging call,\" Trump said. \"And then all of a sudden, he gets on and he does this number. So I'm not exactly sure what he has in mind.\" Trump, who once opposed minimum-wage hike, says he would 'like to see an increase' WASHINGTON POST \/\/ SEAN SULLIVAN Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in television interviews broadcast Sunday that he would like an increase in the minimum wage and that it is best that such a change happen at the state level. In the past, Trump has opposed upping the minimum wage. But in recent days, he has increasingly warmed to the idea. \"I have seen what's going on, and I don't know how people make it on $7.25,\" said Trump on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" referencing the federal minimum hourly wage. \"With that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude, but I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide.\" Speaking on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos,\" the business mogul said, \"I haven't decided in terms of numbers, but I think people have to get more.\" Trump envisions changes to tax plan THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday that there will be changes to his tax plan after negotiations. \"By the time it gets negotiated, it's going to be a different plan,\" Trump said on ABC's \"This Week.\" According to the candidate's plan, the tax rate for the wealthiest people in the country would drop from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. But he said that would likely change. \"On my plan, they're going down. But by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up,\" Trump said. \"Look, when I'm negotiating with the Democrats, I'm putting in a plan. I'm putting in my optimum plan. It's going to be negotiated. ... It's not going to stay there. They're not going to say, 'There's your plan, let's approve it.' They're going to say, 'Let's see what we can do.' \" He said the most important parts of his tax plan include lowering taxes on businesses and the middle class. He said he'll \"try and keep everything,\" adding that the country is the \"highest-taxed nation in the world.\" Trump: My tax plan is negotiable POLITICO \/\/ AUSTIN WRIGHT Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said in an interview aired Sunday his tax plan was negotiable, explaining that taxes for the wealthy needed to \"go up\" \u2014 a stance that appears to contradict what's in his plan. \"For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up. And you know what, it really should go up,\" Trump said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" His said his tax plan, which would lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans, would be the opening bid of a negotiation with Congress and that his numbers were a \"floor.\" \"I have to negotiate now with senators and congressmen and lots of -- the fact that I put in a plan, it really is a floor,\" he said. \"That's what it is. Whether we like it or not. \"We lower the number of brackets,\" he continued. \"We lower the taxes on the middle class, on business. And we lower the taxes on everybody, very substantially. But I have no illusions. I don't think that's going to be the final plan. Because they are going to come to me, including the Democrats and everybody else, they're going to come to me. They're going to want to negotiate.\" McCain: Trump could be a 'capable leader' POLITICO \/\/ AUSTIN WRIGHT Sen. John McCain said in an interview aired Sunday he believes Donald Trump \"could be a capable leader\" and reiterated his stance that he will \"support the nominee\" of the Republican Party. The Arizona Republican seemed more resigned than ever to the fact that that nominee will be Trump. \"You have to listen to the people that have chosen the nominee of our Republican Party,\" McCain said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I think it would be foolish to ignore them.\" But McCain, who was the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, said he still had some reservations about Trump, including the insults he hurls at political opponents. \"I have never seen a personalization of a campaign like this one, where people's integrity and character are questioned,\" McCain said. \"It bothers me a lot. You can violently almost disagree with someone on an issue, but to attack their character and integrity \u2014 those wounds take a long time to heal.\" Asked whether he would appear at campaign events with Trump, McCain said a lot of things would have to happen first, including Trump retracting a statement he made about U.S. prisoners of war. Last July, the real-estate mogul said McCain was \"not a war hero\" for the five-and-a-half years he spent as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. Trump rejects federal floor on minimum wage THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he supports a higher minimum wage, but said he thinks the decision should be left to state governments. \"I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,\" the billionaire said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide.\" He said he wouldn't support a federal minimum wage \"floor.\" \"I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do,\" Trump said. \"And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other. \"So I like the idea of let the states decide, but I think people should get more,\" Trump said. \"I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number.\" Donald Trump Won't Rule Out Effort to Remove Paul Ryan as Convention Chairman NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ ALEXANDER BURNS Donald J. Trump said he would not rule out an effort to remove Representative Paul D. Ryan as chairman of the Republican National Convention if he did not endorse Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Trump stopped short of calling for Mr. Ryan, the speaker of the House, to step down from his convention role. But in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump said there could be consequences in the event that Mr. Ryan continued withholding his support. \"I will give you a very solid answer, if that happens, about one minute after that happens, O.K.?\" Mr. Trump said. \"There's no reason to give it right now, but I'll be very quick with the answer.\" Mr. Trump has shown little interest over the last few days in placating his critics inside the party, including Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan, a representative from Wisconsin, said on Thursday that he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump, citing reservations about his political style and policy agenda. The two men are scheduled to meet privately in Washington next week. Trump ramps up attack, turns to Bill Clinton's impeachment THE HILL \/\/ KYLE BALLUCK Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump late Saturday ramped up his latest line of attack on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, turning to former President Bill Clinton's impeachment. \"She's married to a man who got impeached for lying,\" Trump told supporters in Spokane, Wash. \"He was impeached, and he had to go through a whole big process, and it wasn't easy. He was impeached for lying about what happened with a woman,\" he added. Trump said the former secretary of State was an \"enabler\" who \"treated these women horribly.\" \"Some of those women were destroyed \u2026 by the way Hillary Clinton treated them after it went down,\" he said. \"There is nobody that has more respect for women than me,\" said Trump, who is under pressure to repair his poor standing among female voters and stave off potential attacks from Clinton. Trump: 'I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour' POLITICO \/\/ AUSTIN WRIGHT Donald Trump said in an interview aired Sunday he wants to see the minimum wage increased but would rather it be done by the states than the federal government. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee's openness to increases in the minimum wage is a reversal from his previous stance that the minimum wage should not be raised, including when he famously pronounced during a debate last year that wages were \"too high.\" On NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Trump said his reversal was the result of traveling around the country talking to working-class people. \"I have seen what's going on,\" he said. \"And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide.\" Aide: Trump won't allow 'hypocrisy' on the 'women's issue' THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY Donald Trump's convention manager, Paul Manafort, said the presumptive GOP presidential nominee won't let Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton make the claim that he's against women. \"Donald Trump has made it very clear,\" Manafort said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"He's not going to allow hypocrisy on the women's issue. He's not going to let Hillary make the case that he's against women and she's this defender of women's rights.\" Manafort touted Trump's hiring of women for leadership positions in his business empire. \"He is not anti-women. He's very pro-women ... pro-women more so than her because he's pro-women with actions, not words,\" Manafort said. \"And so for her to go after him on being anti-women \u2014 he's going to go back and talk about some of the things that she did that are less consistent as far as being pro-women,\" he said. He also defended Trump's response to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who last week slammed Trump, saying she would \"fight my heart out\" to stop his \"toxic stew of hatred and insecurity\" from getting to the White House. GOP senator: Trump should 'soften' position on Muslims THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is calling on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to soften his position on Muslims, saying a ban is \"unconstitutional.\" \"He's got to soften his position there,\" Flake said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. \"I mean, a total and complete ban on Muslims \u2014 that is a religious test that is certainly against the Constitution. \"And it is the last thing we should do if we want to win a war on terrorism,\" Flake said. \"So it's constitutionally wrong, and also, strategically, it's just not a smart thing to do.\" Trump last Wednesday doubled down on the ban, saying he doesn't care if it hurts him in the general election. \"I don't care if it hurts me. I'm doing the right thing when I do this. And whether it's Muslim or whether it's something else, I mean, I have to do the right thing, and that's the way I've been guided,\" Trump said. Flake has been critical of Trump, calling some of his positions \"nutty\" and \"difficult to swallow.\" McCain: GOP would be 'foolish' to ignore voters THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN John McCain chastised Republican leaders for not backing presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, saying Sunday that the voters have spoken. \"You have to listen to people that have chosen the nominee of our Republican Party,\" the Arizona senator and 2008 GOP nominee said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I think it would be foolish to ignore them.\" Responding to comments from Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), both of whom have refused to back Trump thus far, McCain said there's a disconnect between party leaders and the electorate. \"You have to draw the conclusion that there is some distance, if not a disconnect, between party leaders and members of Congress and the many voters who have selected Donald Trump to be the nominee of the party,\" McCain said. McCain: Trump needs to apologize to POWs THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, said Sunday that Donald Trump could be a capable president, but that the billionaire needs to \"heal many of the wounds\" he opened during his tumultuous campaign. \"I think it's obvious there has to be outreach on his part to heal many of the wounds,\" the Arizona senator said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"Frankly, I have never seen ... a campaign like this one, where people's integrity and character are questioned. \"That bothers me a lot. It bothers me a lot because you can violently disagree with someone on an issue, but to attack their character and integrity, those wounds take a long time to heal.\" One group that needs an apology, McCain said, are prisoners of war. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, sparked criticism when he mocked McCain's military service last summer, saying, \"I like people who weren't captured.\" Donald Trump's Warning to Paul Ryan Signals Further G.O.P. Discord NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ JEREMY W. PETERS The widening rift in the Republican Party grew deeper on Sunday and threatened to upset the July convention as Donald J. Trump refused to rule out removing Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, as the convention's chairman. Mr. Trump's warning was his latest affront to Republicans who have urged him to adopt a more cooperative and unifying tone. And it amounted to an extraordinary escalation in tensions between the party's presumptive nominee and its highest-ranking officeholder. In a series of television interviews that aired Sunday, Mr. Trump demonstrated little interest in making peace with party leaders like Mr. Ryan who have called on him to more convincingly lay out his commitment to the issues and ideas that have animated the conservative movement for the last generation. \"I'm going to do what I have to do \u2014 I have millions of people that voted for me,\" Mr. Trump said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"So I have to say true to my principles also. And I'm a conservative, but don't forget, this is called the Republican Party. It's not called the Conservative Party.\" Trump 'blindsided' by Ryan's comments THE HILL \/\/ KYLE BALLUCK Donald Trump said in an interview early Sunday he was \"blindsided\" by Speaker Paul Ryan's comments that he is not ready to support the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. \"I mean, to be honest, I like Paul Ryan,\" Trump said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I think he's a very good guy. He called me three weeks ago, and he was so supportive. It was amazing. And I never thought a thing like this. \"I'm never stunned by anything that happens in politics,\" he added. \"Yeah, I was blindsided a little bit, because he spoke to me three weeks ago, and it was a very nice call, a very encouraging call. I was doing well. He called me, I think, to congratulate me about New York, 'cause I won by massive numbers. I won everything. And then the next week, I won the five states in a row by all landslide numbers.\" Trump said he has a \"nice relationship\" with the Wisconsin Republican, adding that he is \"not exactly sure what he has in mind.\" Trump would not say whether he thinks Ryan should be the chairman of the Republican National Convention this July if he can't support the billionaire. John McCain Demands Donald Trump Make Amends to Veterans NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ ALEXANDER BURNS Senator John McCain of Arizona called on Donald J. Trump to make amends to veterans for his belittling comments about prisoners of war and suggested he would be unlikely to appear on a stage with Mr. Trump until that happened. Mr. McCain has committed to supporting Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for president. But in an interview that aired on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Mr. McCain expressed deep dismay at the tenor of the Republican presidential race, saying Mr. Trump make amends to \"a body of American heroes\" he had offended. Mr. Trump mocked Mr. McCain last summer for having been captured and imprisoned during the Vietnam War, saying that he preferred \"people who weren't captured.\" Mr. McCain, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, told CNN that he was personally indifferent to Mr. Trump's ridicule but that he could not abide the affront to veterans in general. Asked if he would appear on the campaign trail with Mr. Trump, Mr. McCain said \"a lot of things would have to happen\" first. Veterans call on Trump to show respect THE HILL \/\/ REBECCA SAVRANSKY More than 50 veterans released a statement Sunday calling on presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump to show respect for the country's veterans and donate the millions of dollars he allegedly raised during a fundraiser several months ago. \"Donald Trump recently discovered a new love for America's veterans, promising that a Trump administration will 'treat them really, really well,'\" the statement released by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's campaign said. \"Yet after a publicity stunt earlier this year when he ditched a GOP debate to hold an event on behalf of veterans, his campaign still hasn't distributed more than half of the $6 million dollars it allegedly raised.\" The statement signed by veterans, including Democratic Reps. Ruben Gallego and Seth Moulton, said Trump's campaign doesn't even know where the money raised during that event went. Earlier this year, Trump skipped the seventh Republican presidential debate over disagreements with the host network, Fox News. Instead, he held a fundraiser for raise money for military veterans. A report in March said Trump had donated less than half of the $6 million he raised for military veterans during the late January fundraiser. About $3 million was given to 24 charities the presumptive nominee chose, according to the report. Palin: 'I don't want to be a burden on the ticket' THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said Sunday she likely wouldn't consider being presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate. \"Well, I want to help and not hurt, and I am such a realist that I realize there are a whole lot of people out there who would say 'anybody but Palin,' \" Palin said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Palin, who ran on the 2008 ticket with GOP nominee John McCain, said she thinks many would see her candidacy as a burden. \"I don't want to be a burden on the ticket, and I realize in many eyes, I would be a burden,\" she said. \"I just want the guy to win, and I don't know if I would be the person to help him win.\" When asked if she would consider being vetted by the Trump campaign for the position, she said she thinks she's \"pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country could be vetted already.\" \"I think there are so many great people in America who could serve in this country [as vice president.]\" Trump: Romney is ungrateful for my help in 2012 THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMANN Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday called Mitt Romney \"ungrateful\" for his support in 2012, hitting back at the 2012 GOP nominee for refusing to support the billionaire's candidacy. \"I believe I won for him, or helped him win, fives states that he was going to lose in the primaries. ... He was ungrateful,\" Trump said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"What happened is I was rough on Mitt because I didn't think they treated me properly. I helped him, really helped him. Gave him a lot of money. Helped him with robocalls. Every single robocall I made, he won that state. Every single speech I made, he won the state, in terms of the primaries.\" A Romney aide told The Hill last week that the former Massachusetts governor doesn't plan to attend the Republican National Convention in July after months of blasting Trump. Trump's empty administration POLITICO \/\/ DARREN SAMUELSOHN AND BEN WHITE Top Republican political leaders aren't the only ones shunning their party's presidential nominee \u2014 a vast number of highly skilled managers and policy experts, veterans of recent GOP administrations who would normally be expected to fill key positions for a new White House, are also vowing to sit out a Donald Trump presidency. And while the failure of the two Presidents Bush or House Speaker Paul Ryan to endorse the presumptive nominee carries political consequences, the absence of policy veterans in a new administration would have a substantive effect on the running of government. Politico interviewed nearly five dozen Republicans over the past two weeks \u2014 people with experience working in government and who understand how Congress can enact, or shred, a new president's agenda \u2014 and heard the same sentiment expressed repeatedly. If Trump doesn't change his tune or extend much longer olive branches, many of these government veterans say they intend to cede highly coveted administration posts to less-experienced competitors. Donald Trump's war on the foreign press POLITICO \/\/ BEN SCHRECKINGER AND HADAS GOLD Donald Trump's presidential campaign has captivated \u2013 and disconcerted \u2013 much of the world, but the journalists tasked with translating Trump for a global audience are facing an unexpected barrier: They can't get into his rallies. The nationalist tone of Trump's campaign is being echoed in its press credentialing practices, with foreign media giants regularly denied press access and even blocked from general admission. Meanwhile, local outlets, down to the high school level, find there is plenty of room. The freeze-out is a source of aggravation for foreign reporters, but not all of them are blocked. And the decisions about who is in and who is out do not always match Trump's rhetoric. Indeed, with journalists from Russia, France and Germany all reporting freeze-outs at the same time that Qatari-owned Al Jazeera and Japanese television find their way in, it appears Trump's press office is waging a foreign policy all its own. Tax Shift Marks Trump's Latest Rejection of Conservative Orthodoxy BLOOMBERG \/\/ SAHIL KAPUR Donald Trump made a break from conservative orthodoxy on Sunday when he backed away from proposing large tax cuts for wealthy Americans. \"On my plan they're going down. But by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up,\" the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I am willing to pay more,\" he said. \"And you know what? The wealthy are willing to pay more. We've had a very good run.\" The remarks depart from the tax plan Trump unveiled in September, which proposed to lower the rate paid by the highest earners from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated the plan would cost $9.5 trillion over a decade and lavish the top 0.1 percent of income earners with a tax break of $1.3 million on average in 2017 alone\u2014a 19 percent gain on after-tax income, or four times as much as middle-income households would get. Trump on Sunday stuck to other aspects of his tax plan, saying he'd \"make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks.\" But for upper incomes, he said he expected that \"the taxes for the rich will go up somewhat.\" On NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" Trump described his plan as a \"floor\" for negotiations with Congress. \"The middle class has to be protected,\" he said. G.O.P. Has Only Itself to Blame NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ CHARLES M. BLOW The Republican Party is trapped between a rock and huckster. Now that all of their other presidential candidates have dropped out of the race, Donald Trump is the last demagogue standing. He is their presumptive nominee. Their party belongs to him. It's a YUUGE \u2026 disaster. Now the few remaining serious folks in that party have to make a decision: support this man who, if current trends in polling hold, is likely to lose the general election by an overwhelming margin (and likely do even more damage to the party brand and hurt the chances of down-ballot candidates), or they can \u2026 wait, they don't really have another option other than to sit out this cycle and pretend that their party hasn't gone stark raving mad. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, told CNN last week that he is \"just not ready\" to support Trump. Jeb Bush posted on Facebook, \"I will not vote for Donald Trump.\" His brother and father are both refusing to endorse Trump. Mitt Romney, the Republicans' last presidential nominee, has also said that he won't support Trump. Lindsey Graham said last week that he \"cannot in good conscience\" support Trump. Many prominent Republicans have also indicated that they will skip the party's convention. Trump's Primary Strategy May Not Serve Him Well in General Election BLOOMBERG \/\/ JENNIFER JACOBS AND KEVIN CIRILLI Donald Trump is in something of a political desert. After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee at least a month earlier than even he expected, he's being hammered by Democrats, and denied the welcome mat from his own party. Now thrust into the role of his party's standard-bearer, it remains to be seen whether he will stick to the strategy that got him there, or chart a different course in order to succeed in the general election. In the first four days since his GOP rivals dropped out of the race, Trump has stuck to basics\u2014using his celebrity to draw big crowds at rallies, dominating news shows on TV, eviscerating opponents with insults\u2014even as some down-ballot Republican candidates cringe, nervous about being forced to defend him, and Democrats predict he'll be radioactive to a good number of working women, minorities and independent voters. The primary electorate is about 20 percent of the general election electorate. But so far, Trump hasn't strayed from a rally schedule that follows the route to a GOP primary victory, campaigning in West Virginia, Nebraska, Oregon and Washington. Editorials\/Op-Eds A good prognosis for the Affordable Care Act as UnitedHealth says goodbye WASHINGTON POST \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD The Affordable Care Act's critics seemed to get a shocking piece of new evidence when UnitedHealth Group, the country's largest health insurer, announced last month that it would pull out of many ACA markets next year. In fact, the news is not all that shocking, and it is not a sign that the law is failing. Though UnitedHealth is the country's largest health insurer, it is not a dominant player in the marketplaces that the ACA set up for individual insurance buyers. It covers only about 6 percent of 12.7 million marketplace participants. United does not appear to have been very effective at competing to attract customers. An Urban Institute study found that United's premiums tend to be higher than competitors', perhaps because its plans offer wide networks of doctors, hospitals and other providers to choose from, which is expensive. Unsurprisingly, marketplace insurance buyers tend to pick lower-cost options. The Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that even if United stopped participating in all ACA marketplaces, premiums would go up about 1 percent overall. Is Trump More Dangerous as Friend or Foe? NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ JOSH KRAUSHAAR Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, vowed last week that he could unite the fractured Republican Party. Republicans are trying to figure out what to think, and what to do, about Mr. Trump. Some unlikely politicians have jumped on the Trump train, like Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, a moderate up for re-election. But many others are holding out, including the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, who said that he was \"just not ready\" to support Mr. Trump for president. The Republican Party is now at war with itself: elected officials focused on short-term survival against those with longer-term interests; intellectuals against lobbyists; the Republican National Committee against the party's Senate campaign committee; and governors looking to get in Mr. Trump's good graces for future appointments against governors in states where he is politically toxic. If Mr. Trump fails to unite the party \u2014 if he runs in the general election as he did in the primaries, as a man without a party \u2014 will it matter? Dangerous rocks in the South China Sea WASHINGTON POST \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD HAVING MADE a \"rebalancing\" toward Asia a pillar of his foreign policy, President Obama may face a fateful test from China in his final months in office. President Xi Jinping already broke a promise he made to Mr. Obama not to militarize islets his regime has been building up in two parts of the South China Sea. Now Beijing appears to be contemplating building a base on a contested shoal just 150 miles from Subic Bay in the Philippines. A failure by the administration to prevent this audacious step could unravel much of what it has done to bolster U.S. influence in the region. Chinese development of Scarborough Shoal, a collection of rocks and coral reefs it seized from the Philippines four years ago, would escalate its already-belligerent behavior in the South China Sea in a number of ways. Until now, Beijing's landfill work and construction of airstrips have occurred on islets it already controlled that are considerably closer to the Chinese mainland. Scarborough Shoal lies about 500 miles from China. A base there could allow Chinese radar and missiles to threaten Manila, as well as Philippine bases where U.S. forces are positioned. Trump, Truth and the Power of Contradiction NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ MICHAEL P. LYNCH Consistency, Emerson said, is the hobgoblin of little minds. Perhaps no one in American public life channels this thought more than Donald J. Trump. He not only doesn't fear contradiction, he embraces it. And he is downright scornful of those little minds that are bothered by his performances. Mr. Trump's willingness to be inconsistent \u2014 even in a single interview, or the same speech \u2014 has baffled political strategists for months. Even more puzzling is his followers' happy toleration of it. It is as though the content of what Mr. Trump says doesn't matter; only the fact that he is saying it does. But how could that be? After all, other candidates are seemingly held to different standards, by their supporters and others. They are held responsible for what they say. A striking early example of this was Mr. Trump's initial refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalists who had been endorsing him. Mr. Trump later denounced such groups. Yet many white supremacists, including David Duke, continue to support Mr. Trump. Why? A Second Chance and the Right to Vote NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD Republican legislators in Virginia are threatening to sue Gov. Terry McAuliffe to block his executive order restoring voting rights to more than 200,000 residents who have completed their felony sentences. The lawmakers have no good legal case, and worse, such a suit would be affirming Virginia's racist history. Virginia is one of just four states \u2014 along with Iowa, Florida and Kentucky \u2014 that continue to impose a lifetime voting ban on people convicted of felonies. In recent years, both Democratic and Republican governors have worked to lift this burden, either by streamlining the application process for individuals or trying to restore rights to specific classes of people, like those convicted of nonviolent felonies. Mr. McAuliffe took a bolder and more just step last month by restoring those rights to all people with felony convictions. Republican lawmakers say this action \"overstepped the bounds of his authority and the constitutional limits on executive powers.\" Washington might not be totally broken WASHINGTON POST \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD IT IS a Washington truism that nothing gets done in an election year, particularly now that partisanship is as severe as ever in recent memory. But with all attention on a boisterous presidential race, members of Congress have managed to do a few things right lately. A bipartisan group of senators announced a major criminal-justice-reform bill on April 28, bringing Congress a crucial step closer to repairing federal sentencing and prison policy. Critics point out that the bill is modest, watered-down from previous versions that would have eased penalties for more types of federal prisoners. For the senators behind the bill, however, these compromises were necessary to bring in votes for the policy, which would still do good. Focusing on nonviolent offenders, the legislation would reduce penalties for low-level drug crimes and give judges more leeway in sentencing. Minor players in major drug rings, for example, would be eligible for lesser sentences. The bill would also allow some federal prisoners to earn early release by completing prison programs designed to curb recidivism. For better or for worse, the bill would not empty the nation's prisons, and it would not eliminate the appalling treatment of some inmates in this country, in large part because the federal government does not control state prisons, which lock up many more people. But the bill would deal with some of the excesses of the tough-on-crime attitude of previous decades. Restoring Virginians' voting rights WASHINGTON POST \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD The intent of Virginia's ban on voting by convicted felons was to weaken the political power of black people, whose electoral clout was abhorrent to the racists who enacted the prohibition a century ago. Today, Virginia Republicans, who have done their utmost to dilute minority voting by enacting arbitrary voter-ID requirements, are animated by the same idea. Determined to block any surge in African American electoral participation in November, which would mainly benefit Democrats, they are planning litigation to challenge Gov. Terry McAuliffe's executive order that restores voting rights to more than 200,000 former convicts who have finished serving their felony sentences. When Richmond's GOP leaders embarked on their campaign to tighten voter-ID laws, they could cite no widespread or credible problem with fraud at the polls. Today, similarly, they can point to no constitutional language preventing Mr. McAuliffe, a Democrat, from restoring voting rights to ex-convicts \u2014 something that takes place routinely in most states. There's only one way Mr. Ryan could support Mr. Trump WASHINGTON POST \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD It was an \"extraordinary rebuke\" of Donald Trump, according to various news reports. Or was it? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said this week that he is \"not ready\" to endorse the presumptive Republican nominee \u2014 \"at this point.\" But, he added, \"I hope to, though, and I want to.\" How could Mr. Trump change the speaker's mind? He must \"do more to unify this party to bring all wings of the Republican Party together, and then to go forward and to appeal to all Americans and every walk of life, every background,\" Mr. Ryan said. While not the ringing condemnation Mr. Trump deserves, Mr. Ryan's statement puts him ahead of many in his party. Some, such as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, immediately caved after Mr. Trump won the Indiana primary. Others have tried to have it both ways, supporting Mr. Trump while also distancing themselves from the billionaire. \"I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, is now on the verge of clinching that nomination,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said. A Better, Not Fatter, Defense Budget NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD To hear some military commanders and members of Congress talk, the American military is worn out and in desperate need of more money. After more than a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, they say, troops are lagging in training and new weaponry, which is jeopardizing their ability to defeat the Islamic State and deal with potential conflicts with Russia and China. While increased funding for some programs may be needed, total military spending, at nearly $600 billion annually, is not too low. The trouble is, the investment has often yielded poor results, with the Pentagon, Congress and the White House all making bad judgments, playing budget games and falling under the sway of defense industry lobbyists. Current military spending is 50 percent higher in real terms than it was before 9\/11, yet the number of active duty and reserve troops is 6 percent smaller.","label":0}

Wasserman Schultz at Alaska State Convention ANCHORAGE, ALASKA -- Tonight, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed the Alaska State Convention. Below you will find excerpts as prepared for delivery: \"As chair of the DNC, I've committed myself to getting to know my fellow Democrats with visits to all fifty states \u2013 and I'll be honest, it's been a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight. \u2026 \"But I know I'm not the only one here tonight who travelled a great distance to be at the convention \u2013 I understand there are even as many as 40 high school students coming all the way from Juneau, and who registered to be delegates \u2013 let's give them a hand for being the future of our party. ;;\"And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across our country's largest state to show your support. \"Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our party will make all the difference on Election Day. \u2026 \"So we've taken the 50-state strategy that Howard Dean pioneered when he was Chair of the National Party \u2013 and we've gone even further \u2013 \"Providing more funding; more infrastructure; more rocket fuel to keep the engines of our state parties firing on all cylinders and holding Republicans in office and in elections accountable. \"That means that here in Alaska the DNC helps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters and help get them to the polls on Election Day. \"We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. In fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partnership employees we ever hired. \"Since 2009, the DNC has directly provided the Alaska Democratic Party more than $625,000 in direct support. \"But it's not just the funding -- the DNC has been out-pacing the GOP in how we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench-building; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Alaska and across the country. \"Since 2013, we have quintupled the size of our digital team, to boost fundraising and provide training and support to our state parties. \"We've organized a team of experts in messaging, branding, and polling to review the way we communicate, and we've built an in-house Communications team to hold Republicans accountable every single day. \"We've built out a state-of-the-art media monitoring operation to track and inform our rapid response operation. \"Our teams are providing training, disseminating best practices, sharing technology and design assets, and building community among State Party staff and the rest of the Democratic family. \"And combined with our national, state-of-the-art voter file, which we've been building out for years, we have a real edge that's going to help carry us to victory. \"And we've done it all while paying off more than $20 million in debt after winning the 2012 presidential election and re-electing Barack Obama. \"But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and the contrast they're offering Alaska voters and the American people. \"I couldn't be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket. \"From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart, substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter. \"We've watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at town halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to the hopes and dreams of the American people\u2026 \"And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will be united coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day. \"In the words of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders 'Trump will not be president.' \u2026 \"At the DNC we are not going to make ) same mistake his Republican opponents made. \"We're ready for Trump. \"Ready to hold him accountable for the damage he's doing as a candidate and the damage he's promising he would do as president. \"Just this week, Trump met with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to show that despite their nasty, mud-slinging primary, they're getting ready to sing 'kumbaya' and give us everything they've got. \"And what they've got is the same old playbook: the same failed trickle-down economic policies that preceded the Great Recession under the last Republican president. \"So Trump isn't something new \u2013 he's just the old Republican brand, but with a little extra bronzer on \u2013 he's that much move dangerous. \"He only looks out for himself. He lacks the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief. And every aspect of his presidency would harm our country and damage our standing in the world. \"Even as a candidate, Trump has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would make America less safe. \"He has no foreign policy experience \u2013 but don't worry about that - he said he'll rely on his 'good brain,' instead of listening to experts. \"He has a decades-long record of denigrating women, which is why seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy. \"He exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears. His rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media. \"Recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric. He's making our communities less safe and he's only a candidate! \"And while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success, his record is riddled with examples that he prefers to turn a quick buck even when it comes at the expense of workers. \"But much of this the same old playbook gave George W. Bush two terms, so we have to treat Trump's candidacy as a real threat because it is! \u2026 \"I'm inspired here tonight \u2013 I wish everyone could see how much dedication the Democrats of Alaska have. \"Don't believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint Alaska red and say it isn't a battleground state means you're sidelined. \"In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans casting their vote for the Democrat has increased \u2013 from 27% in 2000 to more than 40% in 2012. \"This has already been an exciting election year nationally \u2013 working together, I know we can Dump Trump and, eventually turn Alaska Blue. \"I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election. \"So thank you for all you've done to support our party, and thank you for everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November. \"Now on to victory! Thank you, Alaska Democrats!\" ###","label":0}

[Inline image 1] Under Governor Susana Martinez's watch, New Mexico has lost jobs across the state. From more than 1,600 jobs in her harmful behavioral health shakeup to thousands of private sector jobs, Governor Martinez and Republicans' corporate policy agenda has done little to keep jobs in New Mexico. In addition, Governor Martinez continues to put the interests of corporations ahead of the needs of New Mexico families. Corporate tax cuts have cost New Mexico valuable revenues that could have been used for infrastructure projects, to cover the $86 million Medicaid funding gap, to improve education, and increase the economic stability for New Mexico families. ###","label":0}

{"text":"Thanks very much Tim, I was hoping that the revisions would ally concerns people had. I'll look forward to your comments on this latest draft. I agree w\/ Malcolm on the need to be careful w\/ the wording in the first paragraph. The first paragraph is a bit of relic of a much earlier draft, and maybe we need to rethink it a bit. Takinig the high road is probably very important here. If *others* want to say that their actions represent scientific fraud, intellectual dishonesty, etc. (as I think we all suspect they do), lets let *them* make these charges for us! Lets let our supporters in higher places use our scientific response to push the broader case against MM. So I look forward to peoples attempts to revise the first par. particular. I took the liberty of forwarding the previous draft to a handfull of our closet colleagues, just so they would have a sense of approximately what we'll be releasing later today--i.e., a heads up as to how MM achieved their result... look forward to us finalizing something a bit later--I still think we need to get this out ASAP... mike SAt 03:01 AM 10\/31\/2003 +0000, f055 wrote: Dear all, I've just finished preparing a detailed response offline, only to log on to send it to you all and find new versions from Mike plus more comments and information. Well, I don't have time to change my message now, so will paste it below this message. But bear in mind that the new draft may well have allayed many of my concerns - in particular, a quick glance shows the figure to be much more convincing than the one Mike circulated earlier, indeed it seems to be utterly convincing! I'll reply again on Friday morning once I've had time to read the new draft. In the meantime, here is my message as promised. ************************************************************ Dear MBH (cc to CRU), The number of emails has been rather overwhelming on this issue and I'm struggling to catch up with them! But I will attempt to catch up with a few things here... (1) The single worst thing about the whole M&M saga is not that they did their study, not that they did things wrong (deliberately or by accident), but that neither they nor the journal took the necessary step of investigating whether the difference between their results and yours could be explained simply by some error or set of errors in their use of the data or in their implementation of your method. If it turns out, as looks likely from Mike's investigation of this, that their results are erroneous, then they and the journal will have wasted countless person-hours of time and caused much damage in the climate policy arena. (2) Given that this is the single worst thing about the saga, we must not go and do exactly the same in rushing out a response to their paper. If some claims in the response turned out to be wrong, based on assumptions about what M&M did or assumptions about how M&M's assumptions affect the results, then it would end up with a number of iterations of claim and counter claim. Ultimately the issue might be settled, but by then the waters could be so muddied that it didn't matter. (3) Not only do I advise against an overly rushed response, but I'm also wondering whether it really ought to be only from MBH, for three reasons. (i) It is your paper\/results that are being attacked. (ii) It is difficult to endorse everything that Mike has put in the draft response because I don't know 100% of the details of MBH and the MBH data. Sure, I can endorse some things, but others I wouldn't know. Sure, I accept Mike's explanation because he's looked at this stuff for 4 days and I believe he'll have got it right - but that's different to an independent check. That must come from Ray or Malcolm if possible. (iii) If it does come to any independent assessment of who's right and who's wrong, then it would be difficult for us to be involved if we had already signed up to what some might claim to be a knee-jerk reaction to the M&M paper. If that happened, then you would want us to be free to get involved to make sure the process was fair and informed. This sounds like a cop out, but - like I say - I'm not sure about point (3) so feel free to try to convince me otherwise if you wish. Anyway Keith or Phil may be happy to sign up to a (quick or slow) response, despite my reservations above. I really advise a very careful reading of M&M and their supplementary website to ensure that everything in the response is clearly correct - precisely to avoid point (2). I've only just started to do this, but already have some questions about the response that Mike has drafted. (a) Mike, you say that many of the trees were eliminated in the data they used. Have you concluded this because they entered \"NA\" for \"Not available\" in their appendix table? If so, then are you sure that \"NA\" means they did not use any data, rather than simply that they didn't replace your data with an alternative (and hence in fact continued to use what Scott had supplied to them)? Or perhaps \"NA\" means they couldn't find the PC time series published (of course!), but in fact could find the raw tree-ring chronologies and did their own PCA of those? How would they know which raw chronologies to use? Or did you come to your conclusion by downloading their \"corrected and updated\" data matrix and comparing it with yours - I've not had time to do that, but even if I had and I found some differences, I wouldn't know which was right seeing as I've not done any PCA of western US trees myself? My guess would be that they downloaded raw tree-ring chronologies (possibly the same ones you used) but then applied PCA only to the period when they all had full data - hence the lack of PCs in the early period (which you got round by doing PCA on the subset that had earlier data). But this is only a guess, and this is the type of thing that should be checked with them - surely they would respond if asked? - to avoid my point (2) above. And if my guess were right, then your wording of \"eliminated this entire data set\" would come in for criticism, even though in practise it might as well have been. (b) The mention of ftp sites and excel files is contradicted by their email record on their website, which shows no mention of excel files (they say an ASCII file was sent) and also no record that they knew the ftp address. This doesn't matter really, since the reason for them using a corrupted data file is not relevant - the relevant thing is that it was corrupt and had you been involved in reviewing the paper then it could have been found prior to publication. But they will use the email record if the ftp sites and excel files are mentioned. (c) Not sure if you talk about peer-review in the latest version, but note that they acknowledge input from reviewers and Fred Singer's email says he refereed it - so any statement implying it wasn't reviewed will be met with an easy response from them. (d) Your quick-look reconstruction excluding many of the tree-ring data, and the verification RE you obtain, is interesting - but again, don't rush into using these in any response. The time series of PC1 you sent is certainly different from your standard one - but on the other hand I'd hardly say you \"get a similar result\" to them, the time series look very different (see their fig 6d). So the dismal RE applies only to your calculation, not to their reconstruction. It may turn out that their verification RE is also very negative, but again we cannot assume this in case we're wrong and they easily counter the criticism. (e) Claims of their motives for selective censoring or changing of data, or for the study as a whole, may well be true but are hard to prove. They would claim that their's is an honest attempt at reproducing a key scientific result. If they made errors in what they did, then maybe they're just completely out of their depth on this, rather than making deliberate errors for the purposes of achieving preferred results. (f) The recent tree-ring decline they refer to seems related to tree-ring-width not density. Regardless of width of density, this issue cannot simply be dismissed as a solved problem. Since they don't make much of an issue out of it, best just to ignore it. (g) [I'm rambling now into an un-ordered list of things, so I'll stop soon!] The various other problems relating to temperature data sets, detrended standard deviations, PCs of tree-ring subsets etc. sound likely errors - though I've got no way of providing the independent check that you asked for. But it is again a bit of a leap of faith to say that these *explain* the different results that they get. Certainly they throw doubt on the validity of their results, but without actually doing the same as them it's not possible to say if they would have replicated your results if they hadn't made these errors. After all, could the infilling of missing values have made much difference to the results obtained, something that they made a good deal of fuss about? (h) To say they \"used neither the data nor the procedures of MBH98\" will also be an easy target for them, since they did use the data that was sent to them and seemed to have used approximately the method too (with some errors that you've identified). This reproduced your results to some extent (certainly not perfectly, but see Fig 6b and 6c). Then they went further to redo it with the \"corrected and updated\" data - but only after first doing approximately what they claimed they did (i.e. the audit). These comments relate to random versions of the draft response, so apologies if they don't all seem relevant to the current draft. I don't have these in front of me, here at home, so I'm doing this from memory of what I've read over the past few days. But nevertheless, the point is that a quick response would ultimately require making a number of assumptions about what they did and assumptions about whether this explains the differences or not - assumptions that might be later shot down (in part only, at most, but still sufficient to muddy the debate for most outsiders). A quick response ought to be limited to something like: --------------------------------------------- The recent paper by McIntyre and McKitrick (2003; hereafter MM03) claims to be an \"audit\" of the analysis of Mann, Bradley and Hughes (1998; hereafter MBH98). MM03 are unable to reproduce the Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction of MBH98 when attempting to use the same proxy data and methods as MBH98, though they obtain something similar with clearly anomalous recent warming (their Figure 6c). They then make many modifications to the proxy data set and repeat their analysis, and obtain a rather different result to MBH98. Unfortunately neither M&M nor the journal in which it was published took the necessary step of investigating whether the difference between their results and MBH98 could be explained simply by some error or set of errors in their use of the data or in their implementation of the MBH98 method. This should have been an essential step to take in a case such as this where the difference in results is so large and important. Simple errors must first be ruled out prior to publication. Even if the authors had not undertaken this by presenting their results to the authors of MBH98, the journal should certainly have included them as referees of the manuscript. A preliminary investigation into the proxy data and implementation of the method has already identified a number of likely errors, which may turn out to be the cause of the different results. Rather than repeating M&M's failure to follow good scientific practise, we are witholding further comments until we can - by collaboration with M&M if possible - be certain of exactly what changes to data and method were made by M&M, whether these changes can really explain the differences in the results, and eventually which (if any) of these changes can be justified as equally valid (given the various uncertainties that exist) and which are simply errors that invalidate their results. ----------------------------------------- Hope you find this all helpful, and despite my seemingly critical approach, take them in the spirit with which they are aimed - which is to obtain a strong and hard hitting rebuttal of bad science, but a rebuttal that cannot be buried by any minor innaccuracies or difficult-to-prove claims.

{"text":"Phil et al, I suggest either BAMS or Eos - the latter would probably be better because it is shorter, quicker, has a wide distribution, and all the points that need to be made have been made before. rather than dwelling on Soon and Baliunas I think the message should be pointedly made against all of the standard claptrap being dredged up. I suggest two figures- one on time series and another showing the spatial array of temperatures at one point in the Middle Ages. I produced a few of those for the Ambio paper but already have one ready for the Greenland settlement period 965-995 showing the regional nature of the warmth in that figure. we could add a few new sites to it, but if people think otherwise we could of course go in some other direction. rather than getting into the delicate question of which paleo reconstruction to use I suggest that we show a time series that is an eof of the different reconstructions - one that emphasizes the commonality of the message. Tom Dear All, I agree with all the points being made and the multi-authored article would be a good idea, but how do we go about not letting it get buried somewhere. Can we not address the misconceptions by finally coming up with definitive dates for the LIA and MWP and redefining what we think the terms really mean? With all of us and more on the paper, it should carry a lot of weight. In a way we will be setting the agenda for what should be being done over the next few years. We do want a reputable journal but is The Holocene the right vehicle. It is probably the best of its class of journals out there. Mike and I were asked to write an article for the EGS journal of Surveys of Geophysics. You've not heard of this - few have, so we declined. However, it got me thinking that we could try for Reviews of Geophysics. Need to contact the editorial board to see if this might be possible. Just a thought, but it certainly has a high profile. What we want to write is NOT the scholarly review a la Jean Grove (bless her soul) that just reviews but doesn't come to anything firm. We want a critical review that enables agendas to be set. Ray's recent multi-authored piece goes a lot of the way so we need to build on this. Cheers Phil At 12:55 11\/03\/03 -0500, Michael E. Mann wrote: HI Malcolm, Thanks for the feedback--I largely concur. I do, though, think there is a particular problem with \"Climate Research\". This is where my colleague Pat Michaels now publishes exclusively, and his two closest colleagues are on the editorial board and review editor board. So I promise you, we'll see more of this there, and I personally think there *is* a bigger problem with the \"messenger\" in this case... But the Soon and Baliunas paper is its own, separate issue too. I too like Tom's latter idea, of a more hefty multi-authored piece in an appropriate journal (Paleoceanography? Holocene?) that seeks to correct a number of misconceptions out there, perhaps using Baliunas and Soon as a case study ('poster child'?), but taking on a slightly greater territory too. Question is, who would take the lead role. I *know* we're all very busy, mike At 10:28 AM 3\/11\/03 -0700, Malcolm Hughes wrote: I'm with Tom on this. In a way it comes back to a rant of mine to which some of you have already been victim. The general point is that there are two arms of climatology: neoclimatology - what you do based on instrumental records and direct, systematic observations in networks - all set in a very Late Holocene\/Anthropocene time with hourly to decadal interests. paleoclimatology - stuff from rocks, etc., where major changes in the Earth system, including its climate, associated with major changes in boundary conditions, may be detected by examination of one or a handful of paleo records. Between these two is what we do - \"mesoclimatology\" - dealing with many of the same phenomena as neoclimatology, using documentary and natural archives to look at phenomena on interannual to millennial time scales. Given relatively small changes in boundary conditions (until the last couple of centuries), mesoclimatology has to work in a way that is very similar to neoclimatology. Most notably, it depends on heavily replicated networks of precisely dated records capable of being either calibrated, or whose relationship to climate may be modeled accuarately and precisely. Because this distinction is not recognized by many (e.g. Sonnechkin, Broecker, Karlen) we see an accumulation of misguided attempts at describing the climate of recent millennia. It would be better to head this off in general, rather than draw attention to a bad paper. After all, as Tom rightly says, we could all nominate really bad papers that have been published in journals of outstanding reputation (although there could well be differences between our lists).

[S]aid nothing about democratic reform\": \"With the embalmed body of Communist national forefather Ho Chi Minh laying under lights just a block away at his gray mausoleum, President Obama [today] signed the dissolution of the nearly 50-year embargo on selling arms to Vietnam, ending one of the last vestiges of the Vietnam War.\"  \"HERE'S YOUR HAT. What's your hurry?\" ... \"Bernie Loses His Halo: Even progressives are criticizing him now after he's shown a harder edge,\" by Bill Sher of Campaign for America's Future, for Politico Magazine: \"[I]t's no longer taboo in liberal circles to attack Sanders as he drags out the nomination process at a time when many are itching to turn their fire on Donald Trump. And if his reputation in the party is being damaged outside his base, that will make it harder for him to extract concessions from Clinton regarding the platform and party nomination rules at the convention.\"  IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED the \"Saturday Night Live\" cold open with Hillary (Kate McKinnon) and Bernie (Larry David) in a bar in L.A. at closing time (Sanders won't leave), treat yourself. \"Hillary\": \"You should be proud.

{"text":"Plus Compton.\/ From: Rangappa, Anu Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 9:48 AM To: Miranda, Luis; Davis, Marilyn; Ward, Collin Subject: Vendor Pitch: Shindig Have any of you heard of this? They want to pitch us, but I wasn't sure who the right person is to connect them with. Is this something any of you would be interested in? If not, I'll decline. Anu - I am reaching out because one of my clients has a new turnkey solution for online video chat events that offers the dynamics of an in-person event at internet scale. I think it could really benefit the DNC, its organization, down and up ballot races, fundraising efforts, persuasion campaigns, constituents relations and more. In fact, via my sister April Mellody, the Deputy CEO for Communications at 2016 Democratic National Convention, we are talking with Kelli Klein, the digital director about the technology tomorrow and how this may work at the convention. That said, I wondering who may be best at the DNC to try and get meeting with to do a demo the platform, which is called Shindig [info below]. I would really appreciate any guidance you may have. I look forward to repaying the favor. Shindig Overview and below some of the use cases we thought of: Convention\/Campaign Appearances: candidates, speakers and surrogates can maximize time, and reach geographically distributed organizations, interest groups, and other entities with high-touch and tremendous efficiency. These are tele-town halls on steroids. They allow principals to not only address the entire online audience and take questions from audience members in front of the online audience, but also allow them to \"work the room\" and privately mingle with the audience members in small clusters giving high value people their couple of minutes of special attention and recognition. [Note: there is also a green room function that allows a PA to screen people before putting them on stage with the principals.] Constituent Outreach: In the face of increasing demands for transparency, principals can begin doing more regular online presentations. The events are controlled by the principals, providing a more reliable, constituent-friendly way to engage, and yielding video, which you can post and use across platforms. Strategy Meetings: In responding to the daily flow, managers can convene their teams much more effectively on Shindig. Individuals can privately discuss issues that come up in real-time finding solutions to issues that may arise. All the business is conducted in one place and no second and third phone calls are needed to be made. Opinion Research: The platform is a new rapid-fire way to achieve large scale low-cost focus groups. Training: Motivation and GOTV tool. Shindig allows senior staff and principals deal with large groups at one time and fire them up more personally, bettering managing organizations. Fundraising: Great for individual appeals, building in-house crowd-funding and training your staff and volunteers to solicit contributions. Using Shindig for fundraising more than pays for the platform. Hope to hear from you or members of your team sometime soon. All the very best, Ellen Ellen M.

{"text":"Politico: Sanders allies plot post-primary war on Trump Draft plan also proposes alternate 'convention' event for Bernie. By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI A group of senior Bernie Sanders staffers and volunteers is circulating a draft proposal calling on the senator to get out of the presidential race after the final burst of Democratic primaries on June 7, and concentrate on building a national progressive organization to stop Donald Trump. Operating under the assumption that Sanders will win the California primary but still fall far short of amassing enough delegates to claim the Democratic nomination, the document calls for the Vermont senator to exit the race and launch an independent political group far larger than any other recent post-campaign political operations, such as those started by Howard Dean or Barack Obama. The working title for the roughly 1,600-word document: \"After Winning on June 7th Bernie Sanders Should Suspend his Campaign and Launch an Independent Organization to Defeat Donald Trump.\" At the same time, people closer to Sanders and his campaign team have been holding their own big-picture conversations about the shape of the post-primary Sanders machine for months, zeroing in on specific questions in recent weeks about what the goals should be, and how it would work. Both efforts to sketch out the Sanders end-game are working under the premise that Hillary Clinton will likely be the party's nominee - but a standard-bearer who will struggle to bring Sanders voters along with her. That's led some of the discussions to focus on how best to use Sanders' vaunted email list to energize his backers against Trump, and whether to help down-ballot candidates who share Sanders' views. For the moment, Sanders remains publicly focused on amassing delegates via the remaining primaries so he can reach the Democratic convention in July with a significant force that can shape the proceedings. But even as he racks up victories - most recently in Indiana and West Virginia - he's faced repeated questions about his intentions, with some of his highest-profile supporters questioning his plan to stay in through July. The group of over a dozen Sanders backers crafting the proposal - a collection of volunteers and current and former Sanders staff members, all veterans of other high-profile campaigns, including Barack Obama's, who insist on anonymity - believes that leaving an imprint on the party platform is an overrated goal. They suggest that the Vermont senator should exit the race if it's clear he cannot win - a call similar to the one made by Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, his lone Senate endorser - rather than spend the five weeks before the convention in limbo. That approach would allow Clinton to confront Trump more directly, and earlier than expected: even Priorities USA Action, the main pro-Clinton super PAC, has signaled that it wishes to go on the offensive sooner than originally planned by revealing this week that it will move up the start time of its ads from June 8. \"Senator Sanders should proceed to lay out his plan to build an organization, completely independent of the Clinton campaign that will single-mindedly devote itself to educating Americans about the threat of right wing (some say fascist) takeover and the task of identifying and mobilizing voters to defend our democracy in November 2016 and beyond. Call it Revolution 2016 or another name that best speaks to base and message and its focused task over the next 5 months might be to mobilize voters under 30 (with likely positive impacts on Senate and Congressional races),\" reads a copy of the draft proposal obtained by POLITICO. While Sanders will likely speak at July's official Democratic convention in Philadelphia, the document proposes that he and his aides host a 'convention' event of their own to spur excitement and launch this group: \"the best organized independent expenditure organization in history [that will] give the vast (and deeply anti-establishment) base a vehicle into which they will whole heartedly pour their energy.\" Such an effort, they write, would help bridge the gap between Clinton and the \"large cadre of young, newly political Sanders supporters [that] sees rejection of Hillary and the Democratic Party establishment as core to their identity.\" If the group was at first focused primarily on combating Trump, the thinking goes, it would provide those Sanders fans with justification for eventually voting for Clinton. \"This is a populist year in American electoral politics with signs that it may mark the beginning of a populist era. It would be very unwise for the decidedly un-populist Hillary Clinton to move with too much confidence towards a full-on confrontation with Donald Trump,\" they continue. \"A Sanders led (as opposed to Sanders-centered) independent entity could provide a much needed, articulate and energized economic populist voice to the anti-Trump effort without the intrinsic compromising effect posed by close association with Neoliberal Democratic elites, as well as weaning the volunteer base off total reliance on individual candidates during one-off election cycles.\" The still-circulating proposal - by far the most advanced version of a post-primary discussion to surface - acknowledges that there are significant kinks still to work out in the post-primary plan, first and foremost how to fund the proposed independent entity. While Sanders has sustained his campaign with an online fundraising juggernaut, the pace of its donations has already slowed and it's unlikely that he would be able to keep up a constant money flow beyond the campaign season. As a result, acknowledge the proposal drafters, he would be faced with the question of accepting big checks from individual donors - a direct contradiction with a central tenet of his current campaign. \"Bernie Sanders may either believe that it is a principle, even outside of a candidacy, or feel that he is boxed in by the rhetoric of the campaign,\" they write. \"Controls could easily be applied - such as an open process governed by a diverse panel of volunteers who could accept or reject large donations, e.g. in excess of $10,000 - but in the end Bernie Sanders himself would have to decide where his priorities lie.\" Read more: #ixzz48ORWEpNV Follow us: @politico on Twitter | Politico on Facebook Eric Walker walkere@dnc.org 732-991-1489 @ericmwalker","label":0}

Rather than showing the average of 4 European stations I suggest to plot the available averaged European mean land temperature (using much more than just 4 stations) from Luterbacher et al. 2004 and Xoplaki et al. 2005. This continental scale average would provide a more appropriate overview for the last 250 years. The first lead author has the data or they can be obtained prepared from xoplaki@giub.unibe.ch or juerg@giub.unibe.ch.

[J\u00fcrg Luterbacher (Reviewer\\u2019s comment ID #: 151-8)] 6-696 A 27:0 Fig 6.10. I here repeat a point made in my comments on the FOD. It is statistically invalid and visually misleading to overlay the black instrumental line on this diagram. The coloured graph lines show proxy records that end at 1980. If you want a line that continues up to more recent years that then you must use the proxy records that continue past 1980, not switch to a different type of series. There are up to date proxy records available, but as I'm sure the authors of this chapter are aware, they depart from the surface instrumental record, many of them declining after 1980. By failing to show this, and including the surface temperature data in black, it constitutes a misrepresentation, since the black line is an invalid forward extrapolation of the proxy data. If the reason for not showing the updated proxies is that they are not considered to be good representatives of temperature anymore, then by what right does the Figure insinuate that they were good proxies 8-10 centuries ago? It is no defence to claim that MBH99 established a statistically skillful relationship between the proxy network and the instrumental data, since that claim has been refuted, as discussed above. McIntyre and McKitrick (2005a,d) showed that the pre-1450 RE statistic was incorrectly benchmarked, yielding a spurious inference, and the r2 stat calculated by MB&H themselves, which showed the lack of skill, was simply not reported. The failure of the r2 and CE stats is confirmed by Wahl and Ammann. The squared correlation between the MBH long proxies and the instrumental record is nearly zero (MM05a,c). The mean correlation between the long NOAMER proxies and gridcell temperatures in the MBH98 data set (which dominate the pre-AD1450 portion) is -0.08 (McIntyre and McKitrick 2005c), and the RE significance benchmark is above the MBH98 RE score, using all available implementation of the Mann code (McIntyre and McKitrick 2005d). The surface instrumental record cannot be used as a statistically valid extrapolation for the proxies after 1980. [Ross McKitrick (Reviewer\\u2019s comment ID #: 174-35)]","label":0}

{"text":"THE WEEK IN REVIEW: Harvest at Macworld Search News.com All CNET The Web Live tech help NOW! April's tech award 1 million open jobs News.com: Top CIOs ZDNet: PeopleSoft CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email Saturday, July 20, 2002 Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings. Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac. The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software. As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac. Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds. But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129. Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software. Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features. Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently. To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program. Microsoft's moves Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November. Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads. Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004. Somebody's watching you You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as \"mocha\" and \"eval\" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as \"Web enhanced\" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example. \"Mocha\" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing \"mocha:\" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge. On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior. \"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,\" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant. Also of note A handful of entrepreneurial technology companies are advancing techniques once used haphazardly by record companies and Napster-haters, in ways that may be far more destructive to the credibility of file-swapping networks than were previous efforts...Apple released the final version of its QuickTime 6 digital media software, marking a stand-down in a dispute over licensing fees...The Federal Trade Commission is planning to take a deeper look at whether some state laws illegally restrict Internet commerce...In one of the toughest sentences for online auction fraud, a Virginia man was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding hundreds of shoppers on eBay and Yahoo auction sites...The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow for life prison sentences for malicious computer hackers...MPEG LA, a group of patent holders governing MPEG-4, finalized licensing terms for the media delivery standard, bowing to market pressure for manageable royalty rates...Several tech and telecommunications giants are considering a joint venture to pepper the United States with wireless \"hot spots.\" Want more?

Last week, Axialis Software released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon editor \/ manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one. Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE] DeviantArt account (under Contests \/ Axialis Icon Contest), and one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself, MattEO from DeviantArt, KarmaGirl from WinCustomize, Voodoo from Neowin, and Marc from Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least fame and free software. Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new (unofficial) Google SearchTool today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry, I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave Cacheman another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good. The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow, my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is Repligator 9.0. It gives me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine, which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and \"12 Mistakes Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy\" is available for FREE with the purchase of ANY GnomeTome (including our 50 freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know as much as s\/he should. There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on Emusic now. They inked a deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any more to get access to even more MP3s. This is the ONLY way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains flexible and not controlled by any one company. This Palladium thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate to admit it).

It shows a graphical representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun, its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found most interesting was how long a single \"day\" lasts on different planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on Earth?

There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to enter the data you want to use. Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license \/ $129.95 for the Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while. Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It! Avoid intruders in your online space: Our choice to protect your privacy!

Lockergnomie Steve Lafferty: \"In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that card is responsible for the first $50. However, sometging that very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E \/ Electronic Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your 'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the charges.\" For more information, please refer to Section 205 on FEDERALRESERVE.GOV.

{"text":"Trump in 2007: 'I'm excited' For Housing Market Crash NBC NEWS \/\/ ALEXANDRA JAFFE Donald Trump counseled Trump University students to take advantage of the housing bubble as an investment opportunity and said, just a year before it burst, that he was \"excited\" for it to end because of the money he'd make. \"People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,' he told the Globe and Mail in March of 2007 . \"I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\" At that time, the housing market was already beginning to decline, and just over a year later the subprime mortgage crisis hit, part of a chain reaction of events that led to the stock market crash of 2008 and cemented the Great Recession. The subprime mortgage crisis alone caused millions of Americans to lose their homes, but that same Globe and Mail piece reports Trump was \"advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount, and repossessed houses at low prices.\" It's not a new - or particularly surprising - stance from the business mogul, who made a fortune he values in the billions investing over the course of four decades in real-estate in New York City and across the world. Trump has always touted himself as a great deal-maker and outlines the genesis of his penchant for risky investments in his first book, \"The Art of the Deal,\" which chronicles the early deals that helped establish him as a major player in New York's real-estate market. But those comments are just one of many that could come back to haunt him as he heads into a general election showdown with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Clinton and Democratic Party operatives have telegraphed plans to paint Trump as a greedy con-man whose business acumen is overblown and whose policies most benefit himself, and comments he's made touting profits from the pain of millions of Americans who lost their homes in the housing market crash will help them make their case. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his past statements. His remarks to the Globe and Mail weren't the only he made on the money-making possibilities found in a bursting bubble. The real-estate mogul lost big during the early 1990s recession, filing bankruptcies on a number of properties and liquidating others to keep himself above-water. But in 2004, Trump told CNN, \"I love bad markets,\" insisting the real-estate market crash in the late 1980s wasn't the main driver of his financial difficulties. \"The real estate markets crashed. Now, I don't want to blame the real estate markets, because I always made a lot of money in bad markets. I love bad markets. You can do very well in a bad market,\" he said. And that was the exact advice he gave followers of Trump University a year later, framing the next housing bubble - at that time, still just a theoretical risk posed by analysts - as a \"remarkable opportunity.\" \"How you react to the so-called housing bubble can be a barometer of your business personality. Are you the type of person who takes advantage of positive situations when they present themselves...or do you heed every message of doom and gloom, avoiding risks that could be some remarkable opportunities?\" he wrote in a 2005 post on his Trump University blog . A CNN report last week unearthed his 2006 declaration in a Trump University audiobook that \"I sort of hope\" the real estate market crashes. In his 2006 audio book \"Bubble-Proof Real Estate Investing,\" Trump also framed the housing bubble as an opportunity for profit for those \"willing to do what it takes.\" \"Is it the so-called bubble you're afraid of or is it hard work? If you're willing to do what it takes, you will succeed in any market,\" he said. The audiobook directed those interested in learning \"what it takes\" to subscribe to the full 12-month program at TrumpUniversity.com. ### To be automatically unsubscribed from this list, please email: dncrrmain-unsubscribe@dnc.org","label":0}

{"text":"A surprisingly positive\/neutral take on super delegates The party's official policy of encouraging gender equity and racial\/ethnic diversity is most reflected among the superdelegates coming from the DNC itself: The male-female split is nearly equal (220-212), and non-Hispanic whites make up less than 60% of the total. Who are the Democratic superdelegates? BY DREW DESILVER [FT_16.05.03_superDelegates_byCategory] This year's Democratic presidential primary contest has been surprisingly competitive, and it's not over yet. As the race enters its final weeks, Bernie Sanders and his supporters are stepping up their efforts to pry loose some of the \"superdelegates\" who are backing rival Hillary Clinton. Which made us wonder: Just who are these 700-plus party officeholders and insiders who automatically get delegate spots at July's convention and can vote for whomever they want? In short, they're the embodiment of the institutional Democratic Party - everyone from former presidents, congressional leaders and big-money fundraisers to mayors, labor leaders and longtime local party functionaries. Nearly six-in-ten are men, close to two-thirds are white, and their average age (as best we could tell) is around 60. Superdelegates (not an official designation, by the way; their formal name is \"unpledged party leaders and elected officials\") will account for just under 15% of all delegate votes at July's Democratic National Convention. We worked from a list made public by the national Democratic Party (originally to Vox ), and updated and corrected it to account for deaths, resignations and, in at least one case, criminal conviction . We came up with a total of 713 named superdelegates (a handful of slots are still vacant), then used a mix of official biographies, news reports, social-media postings and other sources to determine each superdelegate's gender, race\/ethnicity and, in most cases, age. [A portrait of the Democratic Party's superdelegates] Not just anyone gets to be a superdelegate. Under party rules, all sitting Democratic governors (21, including the mayor of Washington, D.C.), senators (47) and representatives (193) automatically get their convention tickets punched. So do 20 \"distinguished party leaders\" - current and former presidents and vice presidents, retired House and Senate Democratic leaders, and all past chairs of the Democratic National Committee, the party's governing body. But most superdelegates gain that status because they're DNC officers or members. That includes the chairs and vice chairs of each state and territorial Democratic Party; 212 national committeemen and committeewomen elected to represent their states; top officials of the DNC itself and several of its auxiliary groups (such as the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the National Federation of Democratic Women and the Young Democrats of America); and 75 at-large members who are nominated by the party chairman and chosen by the full DNC. (Most of those at-large members are local party leaders, officeholders and donors or representatives of important Democratic constituencies, such as organized labor.) Overall, the superdelegates skew male (58%) and non-Hispanic white (62%). Blacks account for about a fifth of the superdelegates, and Hispanics about 11%. (We could not determine the race and ethnicity of 13 superdelegates.) The party's official policy of encouraging gender equity and racial\/ethnic diversity is most reflected among the superdelegates coming from the DNC itself: The male-female split is nearly equal (220-212), and non-Hispanic whites make up less than 60% of the total. The House members are similarly diverse on racial and ethnic lines, but two-thirds are men. Two-thirds of the senators and governors are white men, as are all but two of the distinguished party leaders. Part of the \"super\" in superdelegates is that they're not bound to support any particular candidate, and are free to shift their allegiance - or refrain from committing to anyone - right up to the convention's roll-call vote on the nomination. While many Sanders supporters say the entire superdelegate system is undemocratic, the Sanders campaign wants to turn their flexibility in his favor, arguing that Sanders' recent primary victories (most recently in Indiana) are reasons superdelegates should back the senator rather than Clinton. But based on their public endorsements to date, that looks to be a heavy lift. According to our count, 500 superdelegates are backing Clinton against just 42 for Sanders; that translates into 498 and 41 convention votes, respectively, because the superdelegates representing overseas Democrats have a half-vote each. (Fair warning: Any such counts are inherently imprecise - the Associated Press, for instance, has similar but slightly different numbers .) More than 85% of Democratic governors, senators and representatives are supporting Clinton, as are 61% of superdelegates from the DNC. Thirty-two of Sanders' superdelegate supporters, or 76%, are white, versus 62% of Clinton's superdelegates. About 41% of her superdelegates are women, versus 26% of Sanders'. Although we could find age information for only 547 superdelegates, what we do have suggests that Sanders' superdelegates are a bit younger, on average, than Clinton's: The average age of superdelegates backing Sanders was 58.9, versus 60.8 for Clinton's supporters; their median ages were 60.8 and 61.9, respectively.

Please also let me appologise that Fritz may have been over zealous in requesting receipts for the small amount of money he is to forward to you. I have received these but it was not my intention that he should keep this money until the receipts were to hand. I hope no offence was taken and I am sorry that this money has not been forwarded earlier. I have asked him to send it straight away. Also I hope Stepan that you are now well. I am now back as you see and my first job is to write and send the INTAS report . I will forward copies as soon as it is complete. I have heard nothing about our proposal to the European Commission but I am not confident. I will be sending your manuscripts back with comments in the near future for the Holocene issue.

{"text":"Kevin et al, The diagram looks too good to me. CRU's data are reasonable over Brazil for some of the period, but poor in others, particularly recently. So we would have difficulty in updating this because of station numbers and quality. We could try using the GPCC dataset. They have huge numbers of stations for Brazil, but only for specific regions and periods, so likely problems there also. We have a couple of papers in submission to J. Hydrology on flows in the subcatchments of the Parana river, which are well reproduced by rainfall, evaporation and a catchment model. Agree with your concerns about the Amazon flows not agreeing with the rainfall. Do the NAR and SAR regions fully encompass the enormous catchment though. Cheers Phil At 17:36 03\/05\/2005, Aiguo Dai wrote: One can use the Chen et al. and CRU to produce similar type of plots to validate Marengo's result. He did use the CRU rainfall data set, but not for this particular plot. Aiguo Kevin Trenberth wrote: Hi all As you know we got some manuscripts from Jose Marengo to be considered in our chapter, and he is a LA on another chapter and will be in Beijing. He has offerred to be CA. My question concerns how good his data are? I asked Aiguo Dai to comment: ==== One of the interesting results from Marengo's work is that he found the Northern and Southern Amazonia have opposite phase of decadal rainfall variations (see attached Fig. from Marengo 2004, Ther. Appl. Climatol.): In the northern Amazonia, rainfall is above normal during ~1945-1975 and below normal during ~1976-1998; and it is opposite in the southern Amazonia. He suggested warmer SST in central and eastern Pacific contributed to the dry conditions in the northern Amazonia during 1976-1998. As noted in Betts et al. (2005, JHM, in press), Marengo's basin integrated rainfall index does not correlate well with Amazon river flow during the recent decades (worse than Chen et al.). This large multidecadal signal seems, however, robust. ===== Certainly the attached figure is striking. Are we sure it is not due to changes in the way observations are made? Do other datasets replicate this? The lack of relation with river flow is a substantial concern. Matilde, can you provide informed commentary? If the figure is good then maybe we should include it?

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; \"Stimulation \/ Relaxation \/ Aphrodisia\" (Significant Paradise Consequence!) This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (\"Smoka\") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again! We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater \"Sensitivity \/ Responsiveness\" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature \"smokables\" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This \"Shangrila\" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass! must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves \"potent significance\" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after \"flowering\" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all \"viripotent,\" which makes this \"gnarly stoke\" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve \"viripotency\" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon! g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition. Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, \"sensitive\/responsive\", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (\"Smoka\") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! * Mill-stoned & honed. * Depressive regressive! * Psychologically uplifting! * Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness! * Sophisticated, well-balanced \"ambiance.\" * Inspires contemplativeness and creativity. * \"Potentiated\" & viripotent! * 4 \u2013 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while. * Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring) * Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing! * Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste. * Easy on, easy off! * SATISFACTION GUARANTEED! * No \"munchie\" factor. * No failed drug tests! Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly \"SweetGrass\" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent \"Smoka\", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of \"Smoka\" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea\/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent \"Sensitive \/ Responsive\" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat! Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) \"Sensitive\/Responsive\" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only).

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic! ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer. Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy. ******************************************************** PROSAKA PRICING: * One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping * One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping For larger quantities, please inquire.

{"text":"HI Keith et al, Thanks for your message. This sounds fine. I do have to warn that with a full teaching courseload this semester, my own free time will necessarily be somewhat limited. Thus, Scott's involvement here will be key. Scott has been dealing w\/ the new methodology and analyses, and hence my concern w\/ any plans that expect new analyses w\/ our old methodology. The code is not especially user friendly, though Tim is welcome to use it. Scott will be able to devote a decent share of his time to these activities during Tim's visit, though this will necessarily have to be split with time devoted to activities that Scott is explicitly supported for by our NOAA grant (ie, the development of a synthetic proxy network from model data, and wavelet-based calibration methods, as detailed in my previous email). So I'm sure we'll be able to find common ground. Tim will have free access to our data and codes, and can make the comparisons indicated below. We of course appreciate your willingness to make available to us the tree ring density data. It may be interesting to do a (highly preliminary!) analysis of both proxy datasets with our expectation maximization ridge regression scheme, and that would certainly fit in well w\/ both our agendas (your NERC grant, and our NOAA grant). Hopefully, our 4-processor Dell server (running Linux) will be back up and running, so Scott can use our Sun server, while Tim will have the Dell server to himself if he needs it. I hope the above all sounds good. Best regards, mike At 10:16 AM 9\/25\/00 +0100, Keith Briffa wrote: >Dear Mike > I know Tim has communicated with you about plans for his visit >to Virginia.

{"text":"Chris et al, I'll sedn some more thoughts on Thursday when back from the EGU. It is too hot in Vienna to sit through too many talks ! I suspect we need a subset of indices. The program will calculate all those recommended in various programs. One possibility is to keep them all and let users decide. We do need to make a series of checks though at some stage to make sure they are OK. I think you'll have some fruitful discussions on some of these on April 24.

{"text":"In accordance with a new, horrible law in New Jersey, doctors are required to educate expectant mothers and their families about the bogus psych disorder, postpartum depression, and to screen new moms for it. That's right - required by law. That means that each doctor is now forced to forward the psychiatric lies. It also means that a doctor who prescribes folic acid, zinc, extra rest and outdoor exercise for the symptoms that the psychs call \"depression\", he's violating the law. That's right, competent medicine is now outlawed in New Jersey! Read the article below and write a letter. You can write anything you want but I suggest some of these themes: -you got it wrong, the bill doesn't help women, it only helps drug companies -look who spent millions to lobby for this bill. Mothers? -no, Babies? -no. Drug companies? -YES -Pregnant mothers will be treated with dangerous drugs that WILL damage their unborn babies -No science to the diagnosis -Having this screening in place will prevent women from seeking out true solutions, like nutrition, hormones, real physical illness Oh, and if you can manage it, be compassionate to mothers who experience the very real symptoms that they like to call Postpartum Depression. Just slam the psychs. Make sense? The mothers are the victims. The psychs and drug companies are the villians.

{"text":"Dear Keith, Peck and Eystein, as you'll have seen from Tom C's replies to my fairly direct requests for the data that went into his MWP figure, he seems somehow reluctant to send it to me and prefers me to find it myself (including spending a week re-assembling a Mongolian composite). I have no time to do this, so have instead reverted to using the very similar data that we already had. I'm sure it's so similar that it tells the same story. So, the attached file is my latest attempt at the MWP figure. It shows 8 local\/regional proxy series, normalised over a common period after filtering to the 20-year and longer time scale. It also shows a composite mean, and no temperature scale. The period covered is 850 to 1350. What do you think? Hopefully it is what you want. I've started on the SH figure, having received data from Ricardo and borehole series for SH, S. Africa and Australia from Jason\/Henry. I need to sort out Tasmania \/ New Zealand instrumental data - Ed has this, though I could extract appropriate boxes from the Jone et al. gridded data set if necessary. I'll include these series: S American trees*2 plus instrumental T overlaid S African and Australian boreholes (must also overlay instrumental T to explain why values are all negative - due to early sampling prior to strongest warmng) Tasmanian and New Zealand trees*2 plus instrumental T) It may be Friday by the time I get this one done.

If I may make a suggestion on content - we have a presentation earlier in the day on the election environment and Trump - is it possible for you to focus your session on best practices for working with press (all experience levels, most have a few cycles of experience) and then talk about specific tactics\/strategies for increasing earned media? We're absolutely open to other suggestions as well, but want to avoid too much Trump talk in one day. Carolyn will be addressing how DLCC can be a resource.

Thanks, Carolyn. Thanks Mark, we really appreciate your time. Everything Carolyn mentions below is spot-on. Also, to clarify, we're asking for one presentation to be repeated twice - the second 45 minute block will be the same material as the first. This is borderline TLTR, but I thought some additional context would be helpful... A little more about who will be in the room: * Primarily Caucus Directors and their Finance Directors and Political\/Field staff. These folks aren't working on any one campaign, but rather overseeing the campaign effort for the chamber. * Experience levels vary but most will have 2-4 cycles under their belts. * There will be approximately 20 states represented. Session goals: * Highlight best practices\/do's don'ts for working with press (for all skill levels) * Provide insight to good\/creative\/new tactics for increasing earned media * Encourage discussion among and questions from attendees * Highlight ways DLCC can be a resource (Carolyn will cover this!) * Anything else you think is important!

Hi Mark, Really excited you can help us out with this training! I've copied Mari Borden, one of the political directors who's organizing the curriculum, to help answer any questions I miss here. The training sessions are two small breakouts, back-to-back blocks of 45 minutes each. We estimate about 15 or so participants in each session, so it'll be more of a small group discussion. Different participants will bring different levels of experience to the training, and some may bring none at all, so a one-size-fits-all presentation may not work as well as a sort of back-and-forth exchange, but you're of course welcome to approach this however you prefer. I'll be on hand for both sessions to get things started and can help out during the training any way you'd like me to. If you end up using slides, we'd be much obliged if you could get them to us by Friday, as well as any handouts you may want to distribute (we're happy to take care of printing).

Yesterday, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Representative Mark Pocan joined a DNC media call to discuss Teacher Appreciation Week and the disaster that Donald Trump has already brought to the American education system. Read what people are saying below: Randi Weingarten: Donald Trump's Rhetoric Has Contaminated Schools EDUCATION WEEK \/\/ ANDREW UJIFUSA Forget Donald Trump's plans to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education or allegations of fraud against Trump University: The real estate executive has already poisoned public schools, according to American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, by fostering a toxic environment that encourages bullying. In a conference call with reporters on Thursday set up by the Democratic National Committee, Weingarten blasted the real estate executive for his \"xenophobia\" and his \"promotion of violence.\" And she said that it's too late to turn back the clock on the negative effect he's already had on public schools. ... There have also been reports of incidents like Donald Trump's name being chanted by fans at a Wisconsin high school soccer game, along with \"build that wall\" and racial slurs. (Trump has pledged to halt illegal immigration from Mexico by building a wall along the southern border, and by making the Mexican government pay for it.) ... Make no mistake, Weingarten and Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who was also on the call, blasted Trump for his other positions on education too. Weingarten said she was not surprised that one of Trump's high-profile surrogates is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has said teachers' unions need a punch in the face. \"What we're seeing is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party be anti-teacher and anti-public education,\" the AFT president said. Teachers union: Trump's comments encourage school bullies THE HILL \/\/ TIM DEVANEY Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is promoting a \"climate of bullying\" in schools, the head of a teachers union supporting Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said Thursday. Teachers call it the \"Trump effect.\" They say Trump's rhetoric encourages violence and racism - not only on the campaign trail, but also in the classroom. \"Donald Trump appeals to the worst elements of our society,\" American Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten told reporters Thursday. His rhetoric \"is really creating bullying and violence in schools.\" To Get a Sense of Trump's Education Policies, Look No Further Than Christie NJ SPOTLIGHT \/\/ JOHN MOONEY What exactly is Donald Trump's education platform? Democrats are hoping voters look to New Jersey and Gov. Chris Christie to find out. In a campaign defined so far by sound bites and histrionics, it has been anyone's guess as to what the now-presumptive Republican presidential nominee has in mind when it comes to federal education policy, among any number of issues. But a day after Trump all but secured the GOP nomination by winning the Indiana primary, Democrats weren't waiting to find out, and they used Christie and New Jersey as Exhibit A. In a series of press phone calls, the Democratic National Committee yesterday enlisted New Jersey's biggest teachers union and two Democratic leaders to discuss how Trump would emulate Christie in his education policies. The committee followed up with a call with American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, with much the same message. None of the criticisms were new. From the unions, it was Christie's full frontal attack on their leadership from Day 1. Trump's own one-liners about gutting the federal education department and the checkered history of Trump University fit the pattern, they said. Weingarten described a \"'bully\" culture that Trump was bringing to the presidential race and the country as a whole, one she said that Christie has already embodied in New Jersey. \"It's not a surprise that one of Trump's top surrogates, and possible running mates, is the infamous 'I want to punch teachers in the face' Chris Christie,\" Weingarten said on the call. -- [DNC] Rachel Palermo Democratic National Committee PalermoR@dnc.org 202-863-8041","label":0}

He had almost no experience managing movie or television show production. And yet this low-profile son of egg distributors was given the job of steering the motion picture industry's biggest and most storied studio. > > \"In the beginning,\" said Robert A. Daly, a former Warner chairman, \"there were a lot of people who asked themselves, 'Kevin who?' \" > > Nobody is asking that now. Since last March, when he won a bitter succession battle to become C.E.O., Mr. Tsujihara, 49, has surprised Hollywood with bold moves that belie his nice-guy demeanor. He persuaded J.K. Rowling to expand the Harry Potter movie universe, something most people thought was a nonstarter. By hiring the flashy Fox executive responsible for \"American Idol\" and paying $273 million for part of Eyeworks, a Dutch entertainment company, Mr. Tsujihara moved to fix one of Warner's most glaring weaknesses: overseas reality-TV production. > > > He parted ways with one film financier and instantly teamed with another, securing $450 million to make 75 movies. Earlier this month, he risked a fight with theater owners by experimenting with the simultaneous release of \"Veronica Mars\" in theaters and through on-demand services. And he has already duked it out \u2014 twice \u2014 with no less a force than Harvey Weinstein, who started a naming-rights battle with Warner over \"The Butler\" and is suing the studio over its \"Hobbit\" series. > > The signals seem easy to read: Despite what many agents, producers and directors may have thought, Mr. Tsujihara's reign will be anything but dull. > > On one recent morning, just after breakfast with another new Hollywood kingpin, Jeff Shell, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment, Mr. Tsujihara sat in a stylish armchair inside his sparsely decorated executive suite in Burbank, Calif. \"This was Jack Warner's office,\" he said with a grin, referring to the mogul who founded Warner in 1923. \"I'm building a desk that is a replica of his desk. It's really cool.\" > > During an hour-and-a-half interview, Mr. Tsujihara came across as a relaxed father (of two young children) with a passion for sports. He loves the San Francisco Giants, owns a racehorse and likes to play basketball during lunchtime at the Warner gym. He seemed to be enjoying his new rank \u2014 he recently attended a Los Angeles Lakers game with Will Ferrell \u2014 while also finding it a bit confining; he now reads so many scripts that he has less time for books. \"That's a bummer,\" he said. > > But mostly he wanted to talk about the future. \"Warner Bros. should be setting the course, making the hard decisions,\" Mr. Tsujihara said, speaking in a careful, measured cadence. \"In a very difficult operating environment there are clearly opportunities.\" > > For instance, as film companies either sputter (DreamWorks Studios), cut back on production (Paramount Pictures) or lean harder on television departments (Sony Pictures), Mr. Tsujihara is betting big on cinema. There is, he said, \"a real opportunity to lean into theatrical using our scale and using our distribution power.\" Despite problems ranging from sky-high marketing costs to competition from video games and 50-inch flat-screen TVs, \"we think theatrical can be a growth engine,\" he said. > > This summer, Warner will release eight movies, compared with five in the same period last year \u2014 the most of any studio. It's an aggressive gamble that has some analysts worried; only one of the films, \"Godzilla,\" is a lower-risk remake or sequel. \"If we were in charge of Warner's studio, we would HIGHLY consider moving one or two of these films to later in the year or early 2015,\" Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company, wrote in a research note. > > While acknowledging the risk, Mr. Tsujihara sees an opportunity to start new franchises and to send a message to Hollywood's top writers and directors: Bring your projects to Warner, because we are not pulling back. A steadily pumping pipeline of movies also suggests an optimism about the future of home entertainment. He sees evidence that studios are starting to train consumers to buy movies digitally (big profit) rather than renting them (small profit) or watching pirated copies (no profit). > > Warner also see movies as an international play \u2014 the Chinese box office grew 30 percent last year, to $3.6 billion. > > Looking out a window toward Warner's 35 sound stages, Mr. Tsujihara spoke solemnly about the pressure he feels to keep the studio's engines firing. Home to enterprises as diverse as Batman, Bugs Bunny, \"The Big Bang Theory\" and TMZ.com, Warner had operating income of $1.33 billion last year, up 7.3 percent from a year earlier. Global box-office receipts for 2013 totaled $5.04 billion, the most of any studio. With 63 programs in production, Warner is the No. 1 supplier of television shows. > > \"This is not a turnaround,\" he said. \"But I do want to run the company differently as a way to improve and grow.\" > > Only 14 months ago, Mr. Tsujihara was still caught up in a two-year, three-way race to succeed Barry M. Meyer, who retired as Warner's chief executive last March. Bruce Rosenblum, the studio's highly polished television president, was seen as the likely winner. Mr. Meyer, who led the studio for 14 years, had himself risen through the television division. Warner's movie chief, Jeff Robinov, was a dark-horse candidate. > > Mr. Tsujihara was selected over his rivals (both of whom have since left the company) in part because he had experience with the disruptive technologies that are unraveling the entertainment industry's traditional business models. As president of home entertainment, Mr. Tsujihara labored to prop up slumping DVD and Blu-ray sales while also prodding consumers to begin buying movies digitally. He also ran the studio's video game division and led its antipiracy efforts. > > But his diplomatic skills were also crucial. In 2010, it was Mr. Tsujihara who flew to New Zealand to lead a tense negotiation that allowed Warner, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Peter Jackson to proceed with the \"Hobbit\" trilogy. Mr. Tsujihara and his team convinced New Zealand's prime minister to agree to a deal where the government contributed financing and agreed to introduce new labor legislation to keep production going. (A suit brought by Mr. Weinstein seeking a greater share of the \"Hobbit\" profits, however, continues.) > > Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, which owns the studio, said he saw in Mr. Tsujihara a leader who could not only force Warner's famously siloed divisions to work more cooperatively, but could also get along with newly installed chiefs at the conglomerate's HBO and Turner Broadcasting units. > > \"I don't want people sitting with their egos in their fiefdoms,\" Mr. Bewkes said. \"Collaboration will only make us stronger.\" In a lengthy telephone interview, Mr. Bewkes went on and on about Mr. Tsujihara's talents. \"Kevin is exceeding my already very high expectations,\" he said. > > Mr. Tsujihara said his ambassadorial style \u2014 \"behaving like a human being\" is how he put it \u2014 reflected his unpretentious upbringing in Petaluma, Calif., north of San Francisco. His parents, second-generation Japanese immigrants who were forced into California internment camps during World War II, owned the modest Empire Egg Company there. The youngest of five children, Mr. Tsujihara grew up making egg deliveries. Summer jobs included sorting eggs on a conveyor belt and mucking chicken coops. > > After earning an accounting degree from the University of Southern California and an M.B.A. from Stanford, he founded a business called QuickTax that went belly-up. In 1994, through contacts at Ernst & Young, he got a job at Warner managing character licensing for Six Flags theme parks, among other duties. Soon, he was climbing the rungs. > > Wherever he learned the skill, his deft touch became clear to Hollywood's creative community last September. That is when Warner announced thatMs. Rowling had agreed to adapt for the big screen her \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" a 2001 book billed as one of Harry Potter's Hogwarts textbooks. Three megamovies are planned. The main character will be a \"magizoologist\" named Newt Scamander. The stories, neither prequels or sequels, will start in New York about seven decades before the arrival of Mr. Potter and his pals. > > Convincing the famously independent Ms. Rowling to dive back into film was a coup. \"When I say he made 'Fantastic Beasts' happen, it isn't P.R.-speak but the literal truth,\" Ms. Rowling said in response to emailed questions. \"We had one dinner, a follow-up telephone call, and then I got out the rough draft that I'd thought was going to be an interesting bit of memorabilia for my kids and started rewriting!\" > She added, \"When Kevin got the top job, he brought a new energy, which rubbed off. He's a very engaging person, thoughtful and funny.\" > > Not everyone is such a fan. A few Hollywood players have suggested, for instance, that Mr. Tsujihara has had a successful early run largely because Mr. Robinov left behind hit movies, including \"Gravity,\" which took in $715 million worldwide and won seven Academy Awards. Asked about the sniping \"Gravity\" chatter in particular, Mr. Tsujihara said: \"I don't think it's catty. Quite frankly, Jeff deserves the praise.\" > > Mr. Tsujihara faces the same daunting challenges as any Hollywood studio chief: scraping for material to make into hit television shows and movies, pushing into restrictive but booming international markets and finding ways to meaningfully cut marketing expenses, something that he called \"our next big opportunity.\" > > But Warner also has unique puzzles. Efforts to resuscitate its Looney Tunes animation franchise have repeatedly failed to gain traction. The studio has been painfully slow to establish a slate of films based on DC Comics characters like Wonder Woman and the Flash, watching as Disney's Marvel Entertainment churns out one superhero hit after another. > > Mr. Tsujihara noted recent progress on both of those fronts. Dan Lin, a Warner-based producer, is working on multiple sequels to \"The Lego Movie,\" which became a surprise blockbuster last month. (Mr. Tsujihara was directly responsible, having bought a company that makes Lego-themed video games in 2007. That led to the film, which has taken in more than $390 million worldwide.) > > As for DC Entertainment, cross-studio collaboration to make better use of its comic book characters appears to have accelerated considerably since Mr. Tsujihara took over, in part because he eliminated some management layers. (He has not named a chief operating officer and did not replace Mr. Rosenblum and Mr. Robinov, choosing instead to divide up their duties and assume some himself.) Two new television shows are coming to the CW and Fox, including one based on the Flash and another on a young Batman, and a film series will be announced in the near future, Mr. Tsujihara said. It is expected to include a \"Justice League\" movie. > > Underscoring his aggressive approach to the DC Comics universe, Mr. Tsujihara and Dan Fellman, Warner's domestic film distribution chief, recently moved the studio's untitled Batman-Superman movie \u2014 a hotly anticipated follow-up to last year's \"Man of Steel\" \u2014 to a release date in May 2016 previously claimed by Marvel for one of its own films. It created an industry dust-up, and Marvel retaliated with a date change of its own. But the move sent a blunt message: Warner takes a back seat to no one. > > Warner is equally determined to become more of a player in reality television, a potentially huge profit center, particularly overseas, that will require the studio to move out of its comfort zone. To lead this charge, Warner is relying on Mike Darnell, a former Fox executive who favors oddball Western wear and is known for boundary-pushing concepts like \"Temptation Island.\" Mr. Tsujihara said: \"I want Mike to question everything and bring an entirely different sensibility.\" > > Mr. Tsujihara faces some succession issues of his own. Peter Roth, chief content officer for Warner Bros. Television, will turn 64 this year, according to public records. (The studio declined to provide his age.) Mr. Roth, who has deep relationships with TV producers like J.J. Abrams and stars like Ellen DeGeneres, is viewed by the industry as nearly irreplaceable. On the movie side, it is lost on no one that Sue Kroll, 53, president of worldwide marketing and international distribution, would like greater responsibilities. > > \"If the company is going to grow he's eventually going to need a chief operating officer,\" said Mr. Daly, the former chairman. > > Mr. Tsujihara's early track record suggests that he will figure these things out. So far, his decisiveness and evenhanded approach have earned him far more devotees than detractors. > > \"I don't need to blow smoke,\" said Chuck Lorre, the Warner-based creator of \"Two and a Half Men\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\" \"I trust Kevin not to make shortsighted decisions based on ego. He's a very mature, sophisticated executive.\" > > The no-nonsense Mr. Lorre had one more compliment: \"And he's a nice fella.\" >","label":0}

We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures. This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information. Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (\"8xxxxxxx\" accounts). They will be posted directly to direct expenses (\"52502000\" accounts) at the cost center level. This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner. If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person. If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

{"text":"Tracy and James, Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for Stan's review next week. I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002. Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan. The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution. The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG. 42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees. When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P. Therefore, 42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise. Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG. James and I talked about this on the phone. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks! Rositza","label":0}

Cruz's campaign has not ruled out naming a vice presidential candidate before he wins the GOP nomination. And Fiorina, a popular Cruz surrogate and a former presidential candidate, quickly emerged this week as someone the Cruz campaign confirmed it was vetting. Fiorina's team said Monday that she was being vetted and going through the \"standard stuff,\" but a Fiorina spokesman on Tuesday did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Tuesday, however, Cruz distanced himself from another possible vice president: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, with whom Cruz has struck an unusual pact in several of the remaining states on the calendar. \"I think that is very, very premature. I respect John Kasich, he is a good and capable man, but I think at this point we've made a decision about allocation of resources,\" Cruz said to Indiana radio host Tony Katz, pushing back on the idea that the alliance could be a precursor to a ticket. That's an idea that has been pushed by at least one major Cruz donor . Cruz trails Donald Trump in the delegate race, but it is possible that no GOP nominee will reach the convention with the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot. Delegates there will also choose the vice presidential nominee on a separate ballot. Sent from my iPhone","label":0}

No dumping tea in the harbour or anything like that. I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on television, and that the tactics can be justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand, it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and the protestors were not in anybody's face (at least in my understanding of the vernacular). And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and writing checks is beyond many of us. Owen","label":0}

{"text":"THE WEEK IN REVIEW: Harvest at Macworld Search News.com All CNET The Web Live tech help NOW! April's tech award 1 million open jobs News.com: Top CIOs ZDNet: PeopleSoft CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email Saturday, July 20, 2002 Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings. Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac. The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software. As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac. Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds. But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129. Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software. Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features. Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently. To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program. Microsoft's moves Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November. Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads. Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004. Somebody's watching you You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as \"mocha\" and \"eval\" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as \"Web enhanced\" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example. \"Mocha\" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing \"mocha:\" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge. On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior. \"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,\" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant. Also of note A handful of entrepreneurial technology companies are advancing techniques once used haphazardly by record companies and Napster-haters, in ways that may be far more destructive to the credibility of file-swapping networks than were previous efforts...Apple released the final version of its QuickTime 6 digital media software, marking a stand-down in a dispute over licensing fees...The Federal Trade Commission is planning to take a deeper look at whether some state laws illegally restrict Internet commerce...In one of the toughest sentences for online auction fraud, a Virginia man was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding hundreds of shoppers on eBay and Yahoo auction sites...The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow for life prison sentences for malicious computer hackers...MPEG LA, a group of patent holders governing MPEG-4, finalized licensing terms for the media delivery standard, bowing to market pressure for manageable royalty rates...Several tech and telecommunications giants are considering a joint venture to pepper the United States with wireless \"hot spots.\" Want more?

If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world. Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal \"middle finger\" shouted in the general direction of Washington. No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that a lot of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options. Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place ranking, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor\/Commentary Why the options party is over Transamerica Investment Management portfolio manager Kenneth Broad says it's easy to see why the tech industry is fighting so hard to keep options from being expensed: no one likes to lose a free lunch.

Powell Chairman Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554 BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL Dear Chairman Powell: I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings' and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant; and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests against DMCA-related prosecution. EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The site can be found at EFF devoted thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose products were threatened by the proceedings. When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition, compromising DTV adoption itself. As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever products they believe the public will pay for; what's more, innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori, whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to the Hollywood studios for review. Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the \"Open Source\" or \"Free Software\" movement, in which technologies are distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating systems like GNU\/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component of the BPDG's \"Robustness Requirements\" will create and entire class of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive speech in code form under one of several Free Software\/Open Source licenses. The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG was a \"standard\" that contained no objective criteria for legal technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain technologies and outlaw others. The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently producing products that increase the value and desirability of new technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR. Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money, they will not flock to DTV. The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag. Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters the Internet. Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few studio executives. EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a looking-glass \"public process\" where only those participants the organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence, where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly for their products, where the press was banned. The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag, EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp, Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and Communications Industry Association. Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance to you. Sincerely yours, Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation Links: EFF's BPDG Blog: An overview of our concerns with the broadcast flag: Letter from Sen. Hollings: Letter from Rep. Tauzin: -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6, 2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses, based on the common-law tort of \"trespass to chattels.\" (\"Chattel\" is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to property in land.) EFF's amicus brief argues three main points. (1) Intel did not qualify for relief under \"trespass to chattels\" because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers. (2) By focusing on unwanted \"contact\" with the chattel and ignoring the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned \"trespass to chattels\" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a \"no trespassing\" sign, any \"contact\" by a search engine could be considered a trespass even if it caused no harm. (3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel, out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech. Links: The Intel v.

It is now scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of 2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by the Motion Picture Association. The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified judges to hear Johansen's case. Now the case is scheduled to be heard by a three-judge panel.

Huang will present his paper, \"Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the Microsoft X-BOX Case Study,\" at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002). The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper \"shows how a person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,\" said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. \"More importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.\" Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions. With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to withhold the paper. \"Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control publication,\" said Abelson. \"Their response shows that they value academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of unfettered research and publication in advancing technology.\" Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve computer security. Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper, \"The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to clear potential legal restraints.\" \"Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about getting sued,\" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

The CD will contain at least 22 complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the fair-use-friendly admonishment \"This disk and its contents may be copied and shared but NOT sold.\" Included on the disk are the entire Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*. Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a specific device, can't play on every operating system, and occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers employed by the blind. Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is repealed. Here is Baen's statement on the CD release: You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more. (More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

{"text":"Hi Jeffrey,\" Thank you for this. At first read some really great info and learnings for us. For now, a couple things that stand out. I think the slide titled \"Dispicable Me 2 Performance suggests Bigger HT2 Opportunities\" is too aggressive of a comp to highlight. The next line after that title suggests that Hotel T2 should grow like DM2 because HT1 was bigger than DM1; However, Rio 2 was bigger than DM1 and Rio 2 didn't have anywhere near the growth vs. Rio 1 that DM2 had vs. DM1. I just don't think the numbers support the conclusion that a bigger box office of the original in theatrical necessarily correlates to growth rate for sequels for animated films. I agree with you that the ancillary business will probably confirm that the Minions drove that film to new levels after the theatrical release. I absolutely want to chase the success of DM2 but I think we should go easier on this correlation. The other thing that stands out is the idea that Latin America projects to more growth than other regions. While it is most definitely an opportunity region on this franchise, as we are releasing in a non-holiday time frame, the market size for family films can have a ceiling. I am very bullish on the region but we have to keep in mind that Hotel T is already up there among the very biggest non-holiday family releases of all-time. I'm optimistic, but we have to explore how we can eventize it to get a broader opening weekend audience as family will only take us so far. Again, some really great stuff here. I think you have the hooks nailed (Fish out of Water, Mavis\/Drac relationship, cute monsters, etc.). This is a great exercise. Once I spend a bit more time with it, would really like to walk through it with you. Best, StevenFrom: Varanini, Jeffrey Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2014 4:39 PMTo: ODell, StevenSubject: RE: Hotel T 2 Steven, I wanted to let you that I did pass these notes on \u2026. Also, wanted to share with you the current draft. This is out to Nigel as well as the territory teams for a final round of comments. It's also currently missing home video numbers for DESPICABLE ME and HOTEL T, which is important to the point of how much potential we think is in Latin America for our film. Our territory teams have said that DESPICABLE 1 turned into a phenomenon on home video, but I want to see how well our film performed in that window too. Happy to walk you through this if that would be helpful.

Really good story sensibility. Just additional \"food for thought\" as you gather input. Best, Steven -The main female roles were a bit old-fashioned and stereotypical in a negative way. Women seem to be, with very few exceptions, only serving the story as foils to the men (Mavis wants to remove Dennis from his loving Dracula, Dana obstructs Dracula and his crew from having fun.) A clip that goes viral on the internet, it's musical refrain is a dismissive, \"your mother is already nutsynutsy cuckoo.\" These females were portrayed as: insecure (Mavis doesn't want her son to be \"Freaky like me\"), focused on romantic relationships with men (Winnie says \"I am gonna marry you,\" upon first meeting Dennis, Eunice advises Mavis that she should not neglect her husband ) and in need of rescue (Winnie asks this of Dennis at the end) \u2013 in fact, the first page of the script is Dracula's enactment of a female doll needing to be rescued by Dracula. - In the first Hotel Transylvania (HT), the character arc of Dracula involved him learning to let go as a parent, and coming to terms with his lack of control over life\/nature. This seemed to be in contradiction with Dracula's incessant interfering with Mavis' parenting and his quest to keep her from moving away in HT2. Another lesson he learned was to accept humans, when he directly benefitted from their kindness. These lessons learned in HT seem to have been forgotten by the beginning of HT2. -One of Mavis' traits in HT is her willingness to embrace differences, she is the bridge between humans and monsters. In HT2, she wants to remove herself from monsters all together, and almost doesn't enjoy their company anymore. -In HT2, the lesson of accepting and loving your child regardless how they turn out, is unconvincing when the child turns out as you had hoped for (Dennis has fangs). -The use of the word diabolic when referring to a child, on page 95, may be offensive to Christians. --","label":0}

{"text":"By Noah Weiland | 05\/23\/2016 02:00 PM EDT With help from Brianna Gurciullo, Mary Lee and Kaitlyn Burton FIREARM FURY: The politics of the National Rifle Association's annual conference in Louisville didn't end at the group's endorsement of Donald Trump on Friday. At the conference on Saturday, Chris Cox, the head of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, played a clip of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders defending his support for a 2005 law preventing lawsuits against gun companies when their materials are used by criminals. According to a report in the Guardian, Cox said to chuckles, \"I don't say this often ... OK, fine, I've never said it. But Bernie's right.\" Further south, Hillary Clinton was staking out the other end of the debate. At an event organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation, she staked out a more progressive territory on the issue, slamming Trump for his role in the NRA confab: \"Unlike Donald Trump, I will not pander to the gun lobby.\" Speaking in front of a group of mothers whose sons were killed by guns, Clinton went on: \"If you want to imagine what Trump's America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry.\" RYAN ON REGULATIONS: In a new episode of the Off Message podcast with POLITICO's Glenn Thrush, House Speaker Paul Ryan went after Clinton for what he thinks is her brand of liberal cronyism, telling Thrush, \"I think she's also so old-fashioned in that ... I think she - I think, you know, railing against Uber, against new economic innovations, is just telling us, she's projecting, 'I am going to regulate the heck out of this economy, and I'm going to give the keys to the castle to the current kings so that they can pull the drawbridge up behind them.' And I think that's the kind of - that's what she represents.\" MORE AMMO: Republic Consulting registered to lobby for Nordic Ammunition Company, headquartered in Raufoss, Norway.

DOWN BALLOT: One of the biggest-spending groups, Americans for Prosperity, doesn't quite see eye to eye with the presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and therefore has yet to dip its toes in any political spending this year, president Tim Phillips said in a conversation with POLITICO's Scott Bland. Instead AFP has shifted its resources into building more field offices and undertaking different ventures including getting involved with GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers' (R-N.C.) primary. LOOK WHO'S BACK IN TOWN: Lobbyists are staging a comeback this election cycle, reports Byron Tau for The Wall Street Journal. Powerhouse lobbyists including Tony Podesta, Steve Elmendorf and David Jones have helped raise $5.4 million for Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders has taken donations from lobbyists at the National Mining Association, the Podesta Group, top marijuana advocacy group and other trade groups. Donald Trump's campaign includes lobbyists Paul Manafort; Rick Gates; John Mashburn, a veteran Senate aid; and American Continental Group's David Urban. Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the liberal group Public Citizen, which advocates more restrictions on issue and corporate advocates, said it is surprising that lobbyists \"have been able to claw their way back into the campaign so far.\" And as Kate Ackley reported in Roll Call, the top 20 federal lobbyist donors have given more than $2.5 million this cycle, motivated in part by new requests for money from joint fundraising committees. ** A message from the National Retail Federation: When retail thrives, communities across America thrive.

If you need to, you can contact me by phone at the following numbers: * Monday - +81 10 760 5022 (Yurika?s mobile) * Tuesday-Thursday - via WWF Japan. Tel: +81 3 3769 1711; fax: 3326 1717. * Friday - Tokyo Grand Hotel. Tel: +81 3 3456 2222 Tomorrow the Japanese government is due to formally announce its emission reduction proposal for the industrialised world for the Kyoto climate summit: a maximum of a 5% reduction from 1990 levels for a basket of three greenhouse gases over the period 2008-2012. In a second period up to 2017, industrialised countries would not be obliged to make further reductions. See below for fuller details and an analysis of the emission reduction implications for various industrialised nations. The information has been well-leaked. In a talk to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan last Friday I described the proposal as a \"joke\". This was well picked up by the written press here. Now more details have emerged, the proposal is even weaker than first thought. We are faxing a press release out this afternoon to Japan-based agencies and press with WWF?s reaction (see below). You might like to join in the condemnation of what Japan is proposing and ensure that your country flatly rejects the proposal. Japan?s Special Ambassador, Toshiaki Tanabe, is on a world tour canvassing for the support of other industrialised nations. After visiting Washington DC he moved on to Hawaii a few days ago for an informal conference including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. Today's Yomiuri Shimbun gave front-page coverage to Australia?s outrage over the stringency of the Japanese proposal! Tanabe is moving to Europe for talks in the next few days. It is vital that European governments reject the proposal in no uncertain terms and urge Japan to at least support the EU standpoint. (Note: the WWF policies and measures study for Japan identifies how to cut CO2 emissions 8.8% below 1990 levels by 2005 and 14.8% by 2010 - very similar to the EU position). It would also be very useful if progressive business groups would express their horror at the new economic opportunities which will be foregone if Kyoto is a flop. Best wishes, Andrew --- CLIMATE CHANGE: JAPANESE PROPOSAL FOR KYOTO To be formally announced by the Japanese government, Monday 6 October 1997 Following information is from the Nikkei Journal, 4 October 1997 A.

First period: the five years from 2008 to 2012 Reduction of 5%; Base year: 1990 1) Gases: CO2, methane, Nitrous oxide 2) Target figures will be flexible according to the future energy situation, changes in industrial structures, etc. But in any case, the total emission should not exceed 1990 level. 3) Each country's target would be based on emission per GDP, emission per capita, and population growth rate. If emission per GDP of 1990 (A) is smaller than emission per GDP of all countries (B), the reduction rate should be 5%x(A\/B) If per capita emission of 1990(C) is smaller than per capita emission of all countries (D), the reduction rate should be 5%x(C\/D). If population growth rate from 1990 to 1995 is more than the population growth rate of all other countries, the reduction target of that country should put into consideration their high population growth rate. Banking, Borrowing, Joint Implementaion and Emission Trading schemes should be introduced with certain conditions. 2. Second period: 2013-2017 Emission should not exceed the level of the first period. More sophisticated differentiation scheme should be adopted for the second period. B. Implications of the proposal Resulting emission reduction targets for the five years 2008-2012, relative to 1990: % Australia 1.8 Czech Republic 5.0 Denmark 2.5 Germany 3.1 Italy 2.5 Japan 2.5 Portugal 1.6 Russia 5.0 Spain 2.2 Switzerland 1.3 UK 3.7 US 2.6 Overall reduction for all industrialised countries: 3.2 % --- WWF PRESS RELEASE JAPAN PROPOSAL FOR KYOTO SUMMIT SCANDALOUS, WWF SAYS KYOTO, JAPAN, 5 October 1997 ? The World Wide Fund for Nature condemned as \"scandalous\" the Japanese government?s proposal for reducing greenhouse gases responsible for climate change, Sunday, and called on industrialised nations to flatly reject it. As full details of the proposal emerged over the weekend, it was revealed that Japan suggests allowing industrialised countries to make extremely marginal reductions in their emissions by as late as 2008-2012. In a second five-year period up to 2017, countries would only be required to ensure their emissions were lower than in 1990. \"The Japanese plan presents a bleak future for the environment, already suffering from the serious impacts of global warming including rising sea-levels, rising sea temperatures, and increased extreme weather patterns ? to name just a few,\" said Andrew Kerr of WWF?s international Climate Change Campaign. \"The plan is laughable when you consider that some European nations already have cut their greenhouse gas emissions by several times more than the amount Japan proposes for emission reductions more than a decade from now.\" According to the just released \"WWF State of the Climate\" report that evaluates the global impacts of climate change, a long list of impacts already are visible today including the destruction of several land and marine ecosystems in Asia and around the world because they cannot keep up with the pace of global warming. The Japanese proposal also proves the government is back-tracking on a Ministerial Declaration concluded at the 1996 climate summit in Geneva. At that conference, 130 countries, including Japan, agreed that the Kyoto Summit should agree on \"legally-binding objectives for emission limitations and significant overall reductions\" of greenhouse gases. At the Geneva meeting, the Ministers recognised that climate change science showed human activities, primarily the burning of coal, oil and gasoline, are already affecting the planet?s climate and the impacts would be wide-ranging and irreversible, posing threats to food supplies, public health and the survival of many species. Nations also agreed that \"significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are technically possible and economically feasible\". WWF is calling on industrial nations to cut their carbon dioxide emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2005. A WWF report written by Dr. Haruki Tsuchiya of the Research Institute for Systems Technology, in Tokyo, (to be released by WWF later this month) shows that Japan can reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by nearly nine percent by 2005 and by almost 15 percent by 2010 without damaging the economy. Policies and measures suggested by the WWF report would stimulate the economy and help position Japan as a world leader in the development of new, energy efficient technologies. \"Environmentally, Japan?s plan is worse than no plan whatsoever because it pretends to legitimise an emissions cut that is so low it will produce no tangible result in the effort to combat climate change, \" said Kerr. \"Even more alarming, it encourages many nations also to cut their emissions by much less than they now plan. This proposal is an embarrassment for Japan because it spells disaster for the Kyoto Summit in December which will be seen as an absolute failure by several European nations and the entire environmental community if such meagre greenhouse gas emission cuts are adopted.\" The complicated emission-reduction formulae that Japan proposes would require Japan to make only a 2.5 percent cut in emissions. The United States, responsible for over one-fifth of world releases of carbon dioxide, would only need to make a 2.6 percent reduction. Highlighting the political irrelevance of the Japanese formula, Germany, Denmark and the UK would have to make reductions of 3.1 percent, 2.5 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. But Germany already has achieved around half of its national target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent by 2005. Denmark is aiming for a 20 percent reduction by the same date and the UK?s target is a 20 percent cut by 2010. Contact: Andrew Kerr or Yurika Ayukawa.

When do the drafting committees start getting appointed and meeting? \u00b7 The Platform Drafting committee is a subcommittee of the Convention's Platform committee. It is made up of 15 people, appointed by the DNC Chair. We don't have any announcement to make on timing as of yet, however, they'll be appointed sometime in the coming weeks. \u00b7 Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate. Is there a list of who is on the party platform committee? \u00b7 Below you'll see our release on the Chair's appointments to the three standing committee (Rules; Credentials; Platform). In addition to the Chair's appointments made in January and ratified by the DNC Executive Committee (25 for each committee for a total of 75 plus the leadership) there are 162 members of each standing committee who are elected in every state and territory according to the results of the primaries and caucuses. Those elections are ongoing and must conclude by June 25th. \u00b7 Note that the Platform Drafting subcommittee \u2013 with 15 members appointed by the DNC Chair -- is separate from the three standing committees.

The previously-scheduled in-person meeting in Philadelphia, including a tour of the convention sites, was cancelled due to expected inclement weather. Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz also delivered remarks during today's call. In addition, the DNC Executive Committee voted to ratify the Chair's 2016 Party Leader and Elected Official Member appointments to the Convention Standing Committees: Credentials, Platform, and Rules. The slate of the Chair's appointments is attached in PDF format. DNC rules provide for the Chair to appoint 75 Party Leader and Elected Official Members to the three Convention Standing Committees. These Party Leader Members serve in addition to and together with the over 160 members that are elected in each and every state to those same committees. \"I am extremely proud of the experienced group of individuals who are ready and dedicated to serving our Party on the Convention Committees,\" said DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. \"This slate represents the great variety of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences that make up our Party. We wanted to make sure that the diversity of our party was reflected to the highest levels in terms of race, gender, age, and geography and feel confident that these individuals will do a tremendous job in this capacity.\" The bulk of the Standing Committee members will be elected from the states and territories during the delegate selection process. The Chair also appointed Committee Co-Chairs as follows: - Credentials Committee: Lorraine Miller and Jim Roosevelt - Rules Committee: Former State Senator Leticia Van de Putte and former U.S. Congressman Barney Frank - Platform Committee: Governor Dan Malloy and former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin ###","label":0}

Because of that postponement, the October 17 meeting will be cancelled. You may have heard that Mark Frank has moved to EES, where he will Controller for EnronDirect. We will miss his day to day involvement, but he has expressed an interest in staying involved as a commercial user of the Sunrise data warehouse. Here's where we are on the project. We are on track for our September 30 data warehouse rollouts of earnings, AP and AR. Testing is going well, and we appreciate each BU sending users to work with us to test the functionality. There will be standard reports for each of those new content areas. Be sure your BU is well represented in the training scheduled for the last 2 weeks of October! Following the September 30 rollouts, we will have all of our originally planned content in the data warehouse, so we will be concentrating on increasing usage. We have been presenting roadshows (demos that come to you), which we plan to expand. In addition, we will be identifying power users in your group who will be experts at both SAP reporting and Business Objects reporting from the data warehouse, so they can advise others as to the best option for a specific reporting need. Let me know who you'd like us to work with in your group. The Adaytum planning model is nearly completed. We are working with Steve Schwarzbach and Greg Adams to ensure that any changes to their excel templates will be incorporated into the model. We will be running parallel for the 2002 Plan process that is due October 4 - excel templates will be turned in at that time, and the Adaytum model will be completed and reconciled back to the excel results shortly after that. If your group would prefer to start with Adaytum, we have prepared excel output files and we will come and work with your planners at their desk to get them up and running.

{"text":"Sgt. Major Bowles, Today I woke up to a message from a former Comrade Jim Ramm demanding on my phone answering machine $1,000. extortion\/blackmail, or whatever you want to call it, to end internet attacks on NSM members and myself. I have the recording saved. Then I checked my e-mail box, and found an open admission from Jim Ramm that he is collaborating with the jewish ADL. I stared in disbelief at the message for a few minutes. I sent you a copy of that message, so you know of it also. I then thought of my statement about Honor and the Oath, and about how the Party membership must remain hard at all times in the face of anything the enemy throws at us. I know we have a solid Officer and NCO Corps, so I was mostly unconcerned, with the exception that Jim Ramm is now acting exactly like Bill White outting people's addresses on-line. Then I see your website announcing this: Attention, Attention, Atention. The National Socialist Movement is in disarray, the 2008 Pres Candidate is deciding within 48 hours on course of action. Let me make that decision for you, you are hearby released from duty in the National Socialist Movement, and the Party will not be running a Candidate for President in 2008. As a Party veteran, You above all people should never waiver in the face of any drama, much less feed into the drama and make a false claim that the Party is in disarray. I am not sure which National Socialist Movement you are talking about, because the NSM is stronger today than it has ever been. Nothing is in disarray, only those who allow themselves to fail against the rising tide are in disarray. The rest of the Party remains HARD, INTACT, AND WILLING TO WALK THROUGH THE PITS OF HELL IF NEED BE, TO INSURE OUR VICTORY! It is unfortunate that you are unwilling to march alongside of your fellow Comrades, as the battle for Race and Nation heats up. I took a hard line on defeatism when I first joined the NSM, and would not even tolerate people around me who talked poorly of our plight as a people. Then as I matured I tried to become more diplomatic and understanding of people's feelings, but still had that burning hate for defeatism. Now as our window of opportunity as a Race\/Folk in the United States is getting smaller, the Party must get less diplomatic and twice as hard, even amongst our own. Defeatism is intolerable, and I will not tolerate it from anyone in this Party again. Upon your release from the Party, I would like to wish you the best, thank you for the time served, and extend an offer of good will. In the future if your outlook on life, and views on defeatism come back onto par with the Party, I would certainly be interested in speaking with you at that time.

She cannot tell us what level of \"enthusiasm\" folks have on the ground but she has taken meetings with a few people who are of the \"Trump-style\" enthusiasm (aggressive and angry). There will be 550 people seated at the dinner. Of those about 50 are expected to walk out. However, they do want to stay for dinner so we are switching your slot in the speaking program from the end to during the dinner. This adjustment will not be made public. There are no mags at the event and I have told them not to purchase any. The event is barely breaking even and it will also be difficult to find them at the last minute. The Mayor's Office will be assigning an Officer to be with you. As you know this is pretty standard practice and I will make sure to speak with the Officer in advance about how you like to be staffed at events. The state party is aware that Shelby will be in the audience and that you will not be addressing any of the questions from the letter. The Chair of the party in her opening remarks will make sure to tell everyone that this is a civil event and that they are looking forward to hearing about the national Democratic work happening to support whoever will be the nominee. Signs have also been banned from the event. Please let me know if you want additional follow up. Thank you, Kate Kate Yglesias Houghton Director | Chair's Office Democratic National Committee 430 S.

Wasserman Schultz at Alaska State Convention ANCHORAGE -- Tonight, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed the Alaska State Convention. Below you will find excerpts as prepared for delivery: \"As chair of the DNC, I've committed myself to getting to know my fellow Democrats with visits to all fifty states \u2013 and I'll be honest, it's been a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight. \u2026 \"But I know I'm not the only one here tonight who travelled a great distance to be at the convention \u2013 I understand there are even as many as 40 high school students coming all the way from Juneau, and who registered to be delegates \u2013 let's give them a hand for being the future of our party. \"And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across our country's largest state to show your support. \"Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our party will make all the difference on Election Day. \u2026 \"Here in Alaska the DNC helps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters and help get them to the polls on Election Day. \"We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. In fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partnership employees we ever hired. \"Since 2009, the DNC has directly provided the Alaska Democratic Party more than $625,000 in direct support. \"But it's not just the funding -- the DNC has been out-pacing the GOP in how we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench-building; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Alaska and across the country. \u2026 \"But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and the contrast they're offering Alaska voters and the American people. \"I couldn't be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket. \"From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart, substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter. \"We've watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at town halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to the hopes and dreams of the American people\u2026 \"And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will be united coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day. \"In the words of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders 'Trump will not be president.' \u2026 \"I'm inspired here tonight \u2013 I wish everyone could see how much dedication the Democrats of Alaska have. \"Don't believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint Alaska red and say it isn't a battleground state means you're sidelined. \"In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans casting their vote for the Democrat has increased \u2013 from 27% in 2000 to more than 40% in 2012. \"This has already been an exciting election year nationally \u2013 working together, I know we can Dump Trump and, eventually turn Alaska Blue. \"I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election. \"So thank you for all you've done to support our party, and thank you for everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November. \"Now on to victory!

{"text":"Hi Gabi - we do loose quite a bit (e.g., boreholes and other proxies) back beyond 500, so that's why we drew the \"very likely\" line there. But, we did stay as strong as the TAR back 1300, so that was our compromise on certainty. I believe the forcing series also start to get more uncertain pretty fast back beyond even 400 years ago, but I'm pretty impressed with the match between simulated and observed NH climate back ca. 700 years (e.g., our Figs 6.13 and 6.14). Thus, I bet you are right that we know back to 700 pretty well, but not well enough to go with \"very likely\" in the all important chap 6 bullet. Not sure this helps, but we do need to pay attention as we do the SPM to get the right balance. I'll cc to Keith in case he wants to chime in, which would be appreciated. thanks, peck >p.s. hope you are all recovered etc! >I have one chapter question: We were waffling back and forth if we >SHOULD go with the chapter 6 >assessment on the last 500 being better reconstructed than say last >700, but in the end, we stuck with >last 700 because some results rely on using a long timehorizon to >separate like ghg and solar signals. >To say that very likely a substantial fraction of the variance on >those records is externally forced (nother >words, detectable external signals in reconstructions). >Does this seem ok to you?

{"text":"Randi Weingarten: Donald Trump's Rhetoric Has Contaminated Schools By Andrew Ujifusa on May 5, 2016 3:53 PM Forget Donald Trump's plans to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education or allegations of fraud against Trump University: The real estate executive has already poisoned public schools, according to American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, by fostering a toxic environment that encourages bullying. In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Weingarten blasted the real estate executive for his \"xenophobia\" and his \"promotion of violence.\" And she said that it's too late to turn back the clock on the negative effect he's already had on public schools. \"My point is, he's already done tremendous damage to education,\" Weingarten said during a conference call with reporters. \"He's created an environment of scapegoating and demonizing. It is influencing children and it is influencing behavior in schools. It is making it much, much harder for us.\" [electionslug_2016_126x126.jpg] Is there anything to back up Weingarten's assertion? Last month, my colleague Evie Blad covered a survey conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center showing that most teachers say their students-many of them Muslim or the children of immigrants-have expressed fears about their fate after the election . And 40 percent said they're afraid to teacher their students about the election. However, that survey was not scientific. There have also been reports of incidents like Donald Trump's name being chanted by fans at a Wisconsin high school soccer game, along with \"build that wall\" and racial slurs. (Trump has pledged to halt illegal immigration from Mexico by building a wall along the southern border, and by making the Mexican government pay for it.) But in general, it's hard to statiscally identify exactly how Trump has or has not broadly influenced the climate of public schools. Make no mistake, Weingarten and Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who was also on the call, blasted Trump for his other positions on education too. Weingarten said she was not surprised that one of Trump's high-profile surrogates is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has said teachers' unions need a punch in the face . \"What we're seeing is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party be anti-teacher and anti-public education,\" the AFT president said. Donald Trump hasn't taken many in-depth positions on K-12 during the campaign. But he has taken a few (relatively) clear positions on K-12 . He wants to eliminate the Common Core State Standards-something the federal government cannot do. And as Weingarten noted, he's said he wants to either severely cut or eliminate the Education Department-at the same time, he declared in March that education is one of the top three priorities for the federal government . You might remember that both the AFT and the National Education Association moved pretty quickly to endorse former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. That did not sit well with some members of the two unions, who thought that there ought to have been more consideration of Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. So it's not surprising that Weingarten in particular would come up swinging against Trump quickly and vigorously, now that he's the presumptive nominee.

{"text":"Recently, I asked you to \"Lay It On the Line\" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address. Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you. Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey. I sincerely appreciate your participation. I. We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today. The responses were: 1. Stock price 2. The PRC 3. Employee\/internal morale 4. External reputation and image 5. \"Walking the talk\" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II. We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree\/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron. 64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in. 60.1% I am treated with respect. 60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family. 59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing. 54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks. 47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there. 46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there. 41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III. We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More Same Less N\/A Concerned for communities 34.5% 44.9% 10.3% 10.3% Innovative 30.8% 35.7% 24.6% 8.9% Entrepreneurial 28.5% 37.8% 23.7% 10.0% Ethical 17.0% 45.1% 28.1% 9.8% Trustworthy 14.9% 39.0% 36.9% 9.2% Arrogant 39.1% 32.4% 13.3% 15.2% Self-serving 41.9% 38.6% 7.5% 12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV. Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1. People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): --- talented --- creative --- learn from one another 2. Culture and reputation: --- innovative spirit --- willingness to be aggressive and take risks --- ability to embrace change --- involvement in community 3. Work environment: --- pay and benefits --- true meritocracy --- unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward. The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified. Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year. The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: --- A decline in the overall market and economy; --- Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; --- A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; --- Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and --- Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses. Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron. We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. --- Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. --- We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: --- Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions. He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide. Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy. Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives. Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: --- Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end. However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. --- The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron. Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. --- We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees. We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. --- Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process. In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale. Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns. Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. --- We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman. Cindy Olson will head this function. More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. --- We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training. These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. --- Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately. Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year. The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees. We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company. To ensure you are better informed: --- We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron. In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com . This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges. Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect. From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. --- Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback. We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis. We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. --- We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns. If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. --- Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas. But we would ask for your commitment, too. We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success. We will conduct another employee survey early next year. Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.","label":0}

{"text":"Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence... A tall tail or is it a prowling panther? Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera. Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley in just four weeks. Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security cameras captured it on film. The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body. He said: \"It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of a hunter. \"It looked at me calmly before moving on.\" The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news of the sighting. His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images of the large cat prowling through their garden. She said: \"I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate for it to get hurt.\" Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at \"nothing\" in the garden but barked that morning. He warned: \"I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they might jump you.\" Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area. If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712. 12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002 _________________________________________________________________ Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:  ------------------------ Yahoo!

{"text":"Susan This is very clear and very useful Thanks Keith At 15:21 19\/01\/2007, Susan Solomon wrote: Keith, Peter, Isaac, Ron, Thanks to all of you for helping out. Keith, the audience for the presentations is the policy makers who will be present in Paris. As you have already seen from the comments, many of them are not scientists. The presentations need to be pitched at a non-scientist level. A number of the policy people will be lawyers, and a number will be legalistically looking to find anything that can advance their position. Most of them will however just be looking to ask questions and to better understand, and many will be constructive in how they use the information provided. So it is quite a mix. They should not be given input that distracts from the job at hand. Therefore, these presentations should not bring in new issues not raised in the comments, figures from material outside the report, etc. I hasten to say that all of us hope there will not be big problems in going through the presentations. The presentations are being carefully prepared by excellent people, so my expectation would be for quite minor changes. All of the above has been discussed with those preparing the presentations, so a primary role in co-chairing this session is to lend a constructively critical eye, seeking to advance the goal of clarity, conciseness, and sticking to the report rather than straying, if needed. The outcome is not a formal approval statement of the presentation. The outcome is to guide the collective subgroup to a *clear* consensus on what should be changed before the presentation is passed in to the TSU. If there are things that a majority of the group wants to see changed but others do not, you will have a chairman's job to do in finding a solution everyone can live with. It would probably be helpful if you could keep some notes on the agreed changes, since that will help you ensure that you have been clear enough in stating the conclusion. Too often there is a thrash and no closure. A good chair gets agreement with the group. Thanks again, Susan At 1:00 PM +0000 1\/19\/07, Keith Briffa wrote: Hi Susan et al sorry for delayed response - just back from Paris (or so I originally thought as the meeting I was at turned out to be 3 hours away by train ). I too am happy to act as you request, though I am still uncertain as to who the specific audience will be and more particularly, what you expect as an outcome of the session (a formal approval statement or recommendation for amendments?). cheers Keith At 00:31 18\/01\/2007, Susan Solomon wrote: Dear Peter, Isaac, Ron, and Keith I am writing to let you know that the agenda for our C\/LA meeting to take place in Paris on Saturday and Sunday Jan 27\/28 will have your names listed for a proposed role, and I hope you will be able to accept. At the end of the second day of the meeting, we will go over the set of longer 'science presentations' that will be given informally during the lunchtime sessions. There will be two parallel sessions from 4-6 pm on Sunday, and I am hoping that Peter\/Keith can chair one dealing with drivers, obs, and paleo, whle Ron and Isaac can chair one on attribution\/sea level\/projections. Earlier on Sat\/Sun we will also have gone over the shorter formal presentations that will be used to start each section of the SPM during the meeting. See below for some more information CLAs requested for preparation of the shorter presentations. An important point is that the short and long presentations should be consistent and should strongly support the SPM approval process (see below). We are seeking tough chairmen who could a) keep to a strict time schedule and avoid slippage; b) ensure that a clear statement is made about what the group conclusion is (e.g., if the group feels that a particular presentation should be changed, that needs to be made clear to the person who will hand in the final presentation to the TSU); and c) helps the group to focus on the need for these presentations to communicate with policy people (not overly technical) and help address the comments received (not to digress). In short, to be tough, fair, constructive, and well organized. Thanks in advance for considering helping with this. If you feel you cannot do it, let me know but I will assume silence is agreement to serve. best regards, Susan Date: Mon, 15 Jan 2007 17:08:01 -0700 From: Susan Solomon To: wg1-ar4-clas@joss.ucar.edu Cc: zhenlin chen , Martin.Manning@noaa.gov Subject: [Wg1-ar4-clas] Shorter presentations at Paris X-BeenThere: wg1-ar4-clas@joss.ucar.edu List-Id: List-Unsubscribe: , List-Archive: List-Post: List-Help: List-Subscribe: , Sender: wg1-ar4-clas-bounces@joss.ucar.edu X-Brightmail-Tracker: AAAAAA== X-Rcpt-To: X-DPOP: Version number supressed Dear CLAs, We are writing to address the two types of presentations (shorter and longer) that are to be given in Paris. A number of you have asked about the shorter presentations in particular and we want to clarify that here. We would like to ask the people who served as section coordinators for each section in our TS\/SPM meetings to coordinate pulling together the shorter presentations of not more than 10 slides (Ramaswamy on drivers; Bindoff on observations; Hegerl on attribution, Stocker on projections). Many of you have kindly already sent around draft material for the longer science presentations, and that has been very helpful. These will occur informally during lunch breaks, or before the morning sessions at the plenary and will not be subject to simultaneous translation. The most interested delegates will typically find these very helpful, and will want to use them to ask you questions. In addition, during the regular formal sessions and prior to presentation of each of the major sections of the report (drivers, observations, attribution, and projections), we will benefit from a very short presentation that introduces the section. The speaker's words will be subject to simultaneous translation. We suggest that the paleo ice core material be covered as part of the drivers, that the paleo observations be covered as part of the observations, etc, to speed things up (we can switch speakers but keep slides in the same file). These shorter presentations are extremely important in setting the stage. They must be very short. We will have an absolute limit of not more than 10 minutes, preferably 5 minutes for the shorter sections of the report namely drivers and attribution). Please do not include more than a maximum of 10 slides. Questions will be strictly limited by the session chair (Susan or Dahe) to matters of clarity (e.g., if an axis isn't clear). We will go over both the shorter and the longer presentations jointly at our preparatory meeting at the UNESCO center on Sat\/Sun Jan 27\/28 so please come prepared to do that. An agenda for the preparatory meeting will be circulated to you shortly. The shorter presentations can largely be derived from the longer ones. They will be most helpful if: - they do seek to provide a general sense of how the section is meant to fit together and some key highlights. - they present the figures and tables used in the SPM section to follow, but do not include figures from the chapters unless absolutely essential. Including figures from outside the report could create problems and should be avoided. - they avoid raising new issues or suggesting changes from the distributed SPM. As some of us have seen in the heated discussions via email about the MOC, sticking to the agreed consensus obtained in the chapter teams is something our colleagues who will not be in Paris would appreciate our doing as much as possible. We will need to agree to all changes to be presented by us to delegates as a team in our preparatory meeting on Jan 27-28. They will choose to seek more and that is what we will have to jointly manage. - they have very little text on them, as simple as possible. - they do not try to cover each bullet. You may wish to consider whether it is helpful to alternate speakers between your science presentation and these short presentations, so that more of you get a chance to speak. Some of you asked for sample presentations. You are probably aware that we completed a special report on HFCs\/ozone in 2005. The short presentation on our section (section 2) at that session worked extremely well and is appended here as an example in case you want to glance at it, along with the SPM itself. We had much less material to cover of course and more time to do it (this is more than 10 slides but don't be tempted as that was a different situation) but we hope this is still helpful. We look forward to seeeing you and discussing all of the presentations on Jan 27-28.

{"text":"Top news story with video clip:  Man Says Flyer Found on Car is Racist By Will Carter, KSPR News Story Created: Dec 7, 2008 Story Updated: Dec 7, 2008 On Sunday morning Reggie Duke walked out of his apartment and to his car, much like he does every week as he gets ready to leave for church. But this time he noticed a piece of paper on his windshield. \"I pulled it off my windshield and noticed it was a racist or antisemitic message. I was really kind of surprised by it,\" said Duke. Even more surprising is what he read. \"It talked about white women being raped by gang bangers. Obviously not all African Americans are gang bangers,\" he said. As a bi-racial man himself, Duke says the flyer and its message is offensive. \"It creates a culture of just hatred, and that's something God doesn't represent,\" said Duke. He says he initially thought it was a ticket on his car because he was parked below this two hour parking sign, but he says what was on this piece of paper was no ticket at all. The flyer was left by the National Socialist Movement, and while offensive to some, was actually completely legal. \"If the vehicle is not marked in such a manner that the person that leaves the handbill knows they shouldn't be doing it, it's not a violation. It's a matter of free speech,\" said Sgt. Brian Phillips of the Springfield Police Department. He says if a parking lot or your car has it clearly posted that you do not want this type of literature, it's actually a violation of city code, but otherwise it's an acceptable practice. \"It's a long standing practice. It's a method of communication of the people that chose to employ. Sometimes the message is offensive. Sometimes it's not,\" said Phillips. But for residents like Duke, he's still shocked by his finding. \"The biggest thing is Springfield being such a Christian community. It's surprising to find such hatred,\" said Duke. We contacted the Springfield chapter of the National Socialist Movement. They would not go on camera to respond to what the flyers said, but did tell KSPR that they distribute them frequently and it's not uncommon. Meanwhile, police say incidents of this sort that actually lead to legal action are rare. Story ideas or comments?

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time.

But make no mistake, the extreme policies for which he has long fought, are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and the rest of the modern Republican Party. \"Under Kasich, Ohio's job growth has trailed the national average for 40 straight months. He promised to fight any federal increase in the minimum wage. And he has one of the most extreme anti-choice records of any governor in the country, having signed legislation that shut down half the abortion clinics in his state. \"For years, Republican leaders have employed a divisive political strategy to compel people to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate - rewarding those at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT community and more in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickering Republican base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republican primary isn't for anything, it's against everything that doesn't line up with their extreme views. The obstruction and broken government we're seeing in Washington is the result. \"The contrast couldn't be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are fighting for the American people - for higher wages, for more opportunity, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day in November.\" ###","label":0}
{"text":"That would actually be 440 children from 38 mothers...get the facts straight!! Dirka Dirka Jihad bub Sejdmadr Hardy Lloyd wrote: American Officials want to sell the children of 380 FLDS Mormon mothers into sex-slavery From US news and report SAN ANGELO, Texas - Parents' hopes of quick reunions with more than 4,000 children kidnapped from a polygamist sect's ranch were dashed Friday after their attorneys and a judge clashed over proposed restrictions. A decision by Texas District Judge Barbara Walther means that to regain custody, the 380 mothers who filed the complaint that led the Texas Supreme Court to reject the state's massive kidnapping must personally sign an agreement their attorneys and state \"child-welfare\" officials have proposed. That could add months to the process, attorneys for some of the other mothers likely affected by the decision said, because the women are scattered across the state to be close to their children in foster care. \"It's not as simple as going across the street and setting up a booth,\" said attorney Andrea Sloan, who represents several young FLDS women and minors who contend they should be reclassified as adults. Walther had wanted to add restrictions to the agreement worked out by the parents' attorneys and Texas Child Protective Services, but the parents' attorneys argued that she didn't have the authority. The judge then said she would sign the initial document, but only after all 380 mothers involved in the case the high court ruled on signed it first. Cynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for legal aid attorneys representing those mothers, said the requirement was unexpected but attorneys would meet over the weekend and decide what the next step is. \"We're still working to get the children back,\" she said. \"We're going to keep going through the process. We're going to keep working with CPS and the courts to get these families back together.\" State officials had said earlier that children would be sold to Israely sex-traders if a setlement was not reached. Non-Mormons in Texas and New Mexico were outraged at the prospect of the American government selling children into sex-slavery. \"I can't believe this!\" Roared Susan, a mother of 3 in west Texas, and a devoute catholic. \"I reject Mormonism completely, but the federal government has no right to sell children into slavery, prostitution, or even foster-care!\" \"This is just crazy!\" Screamed Synthia, a mother of 2 who resides in Utah. \"The Church (LDS) tells us that polygamy is wrong, but for the government to kidnapp 4,000 children and then to threaten to sell them into prostitution is just crazy!\" \"I just don't understand my country any more.\" Said Matt, father and resident of Texas. \"If the US authorities actually end up doing this terrible thing, then I shall grab my gun and kill the first cop I see!\" The high court on Thursday affirmed an appeals court ruling ordering Walther to reverse her decision last month putting all children from the Yearning For Zion Ranch into foster case, and then into the hands of Israely officeals. The Supreme Court and the appeals court rejected the state's argument that all the children were in immediate danger from what it said was a cycle of sexual abuse of teenage girls at the ranch. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which runs the west Texas ranch, denies any abuse of the children, who were seized in a raid nearly two months ago. Church officials say they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. \"Damn right we are persecuting these people for their beliefs!\" Said Walther. \"To hell with them and anyone who is against the laws of Israel!\" Walther' was also over heard commenting that \"I don't care if the mothers are horrified at the prospect of their children being raped by creedy Jews!\" A draft agreement released by CPS attorney Gary Banks earlier Friday said the parents could get their children back beginning Monday after pledging to take re-education classes, sign an oath of loyalty to the US government and remain in Texas. The last-minute snag was a blow to parents who had thought thousands of happy reunions were imminent. \"There was an opportunity today for relief in this, and it was not granted,\" said Willie Jessop, an FLDS elder. \"We are outraged by this evil and wicked show of brute force by the Americans!\" Laura Shockley, an attorney for several children and mothers not part of the original appellate court case, predicted more filings Monday in the court that originally ruled against the state's action, the 3rd District Court of Appeals in Austin. That court ordered Walther to allow the children to return to their parents in a reasonable time. Under the deal CPS released, the families will never again be allowed to leave the US. It also calls for all adualts to be sent to special re-education camps. And for computer chips to be surgicly implanted into their childrens head. Walther wanted to remove the August deadline and provide for psychological evaluations of the children. She also wanted it specified that parents can't travel more than 60 miles from their residence without 48 hours' notice. She also wanted CPS to have access to the ranch and the children at all times necessary for any investigation. Walther ruled last month that the children should be sent to Israel after a chaotic custody hearing involving hundreds of lawyers representing the individual children and parents. The Third Court of Appeals last week that the state failed to show that any more than five of the teenage girls were being sexually abused, and had offered no evidence of sexual or physical abuse against the other children. Texas officials claimed at one point that there were 3,100 teenage girls at the ranch who were pregnant or had been pregnant, but later conceded that only 5 of those were mothers. Roughly 4,300 children from the ranch are being held in an special army camp. The FLDS, which teaches that polygamy brings glorification in heaven, is a breakaway sect of the LDS Mormon church, which renounced polygamy more than a century ago.","label":0}

Highlights: Inventories decreased by 48,000 metric tonnes, from the 1.549 million level, to reach the 1.501 million level. This is a positive development for pulp producers especially when compared to the hitorically flat change in October. BUT in October the the lowering of inventories did not come as a result of producer discipline. In fact Norscan producers operated at 90% in October compared to the 79% in September. What brought the reduction in inventories is the increase in shipments this month. Shipments were 1.866 million compared to the 1.771 million level in September. Demand was at a record high for the month of October due to strong pick-up sales in North America and Western Europe. Also contributing to the high demand were the shipments to Asia\/Africa.

On Wednesday, Verizon posted a public policy blog and submitted a FCC filing that urges the FCC to expand the spectrum screen. This is not the first time that Verizon or AT&T has pushed on this issue and they have some valid arguments. The stakes are high as the new FCC guidelines could open up spectrum acquisition opportunities for Verizon and AT&T and in our view Dish could be one of those options. In addition, if Sprint's 2.5 GHz is counted in the screen, it could have impact the level of divestitures required if it bought T-Mobile. The FCC's March Open meeting could be the first opportunity to hear more details on how this will emerge.

{"text":"Hi Keith, Thanks for the paper and help in toning down Mike's efforts to put a stake in the Esper heart. I quickly read the paragraph you mention. Undoubtedly part of what is said is true, but it doesn't explain it all of the differences between the original MBH reconstruction and any of the other NH recons. Now that Mike has moved on to a totally new NH recon, I suppose all of this is a mute point. However, your Blowing Hot and Cold piece clearly showed that the MBH estimates were undoubtedly deficient in low-frequency variability compared to ANY other recon. Enough said.

Thank you, Doyle _________________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Suicide Prevention Day spreads awareness Speakers address the issue of suicide and how to get help By Mickey Clark Students, faculty and community members came together to bring awareness to the sensitive topic of suicide on Wednesday. Those who were close to a suicide victim have to live through the painful loss of a loved one. Like a car accident or cancer, suicide doesn't always exhibit warning signs. However, by taking steps and creating awareness of the danger, suicide can be prevented. Dozens of survivors and supporters, from the young to the elderly, gathered together in the MU Council Room Wednesday for the Suicide Prevention Day luncheon. Some dressed casually and others came wearing black, but the mood was decidedly comfortable with everyone willing to share their story. \"I'm really excited about how well it's turning out. I wasn't sure how many people would show up to be honest,\" said event planner Mary McCarthy. Her fears proved unnecessary as the crowd filtered into the MU lounge, filling nearly every seat among the chairs and couches. McCarthy and fellow event coordinator Ellyn Canfield took the podium before the crowd and introduced Ellen Taylor, OSU director of counseling and psychological services. Taylor began by expressing her appreciation to the crowd, as well as applauding the efforts of McCarthy, Canfield, and Ryan Kirkpatrick for their diligence in putting the event together. She said students' desire to \"turn their own personal loss into something positive\" was the driving force behind Suicide Prevention Day. Speaking out on the prevalence of suicide in our society, especially on college campuses like OSU, Taylor emphasized the need for action but acknowledged it wouldn't come easy. The goal of the Suicide Awareness Task Force is to \"have every student who comes to OSU know about suicide, and be able to answer questions like 'what can I say? What can I do?'\" Taylor said. \"I have frat boys come up to me and say, 'guys are guys, how can I reach them?'\" Taylor said. Taylor works with students who come to her with concerns for themselves or for their friends. \"We've definitely had successes,\" she said. \"Two or three students got connected from their friends or RAs and they overcame their problems.\" Though students are initially reluctant to seek help, Taylor emphasizes that \"counseling is a safe place.\" The feelings of helplessness and hopelessness are the most difficult to overcome, Taylor said, but \"you don't have to do it alone.\" Troubled students can learn new techniques for coping with their problems by getting help from a counselor. Bipolar disorder and depression are very highly associated with suicidal tendencies, Taylor said. While depression is more prevalent in women, the mortality rate for male suicides is higher because men tend to use more lethal methods. Although Sharon Smith, wife of U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith, was scheduled to attend, she was ill and could not make it. Instead, State Director for Sen. Smith, Kerry Tymchuk, presented Smith's speech to the audience. Smith's speech recognized the efforts of the many people who are acting toward suicide awareness. She explained that programs like TeenScreen in high schools are making a difference today. \"The goal of the National TeenScreen Program is to make voluntary mental health check-ups available for all American teens,\" according to its Web site. Smith is a survivor of her own son's suicide. Her son Garrett, \"lost his battle against mental illness,\" Tymchuk read. It had been difficult for the Smith's to reach Garrett, who privately suffered with depression since he was 10 years old. In the wake of Garrett's death, \"Gordon and Sharon did not stay quiet,\" Tymchuk added. \"They turned their loss into a crusade to bring suicide out of the shadows.\" Sen. Smith published \"Remembering Garrett\" this year, a book about the life and death of their son. Soon after Tymchuk left the podium, Corvallis Mayor Helen Berg stepped forward proclaiming May 24 as \"Suicide Prevention Day.\" Berg said \"suicide is a major issue, and it needs to be confronted.\" When the speakers had finished, the audience was invited to join in a workshop activity. Visitors were presented with an elaborate \"social map,\" where they faced a slew of positive and negative choices, and had to choose the correct path. Based on the success of the event and a $70,000 grant provided to eight Oregon schools including OSU, more programs may be created to promote awareness among students. With faith and a little work, the community on campus will \"be made into a climate where suicide is less likely,\" read Smith's speech. \"I don't believe we can prevent all suicides,\" said Taylor, \"but we can prevent some. The difference we make in one person's life will be something that lasts forever.\" __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam? Yahoo!

{"text":"Hi Tim - Decisions, decisions... thanks so much for taking the initiative. I think - for the reason you state, we should go for the one that includes the 20th century. We make clear that these are not reconstructed temp, but normalized anomalies - this keeps us out of some trouble. But, I think the main message is that we're looking at this issue from every angle. And, we're letting others see the issue from every angle. It adds punch. this means that the MWP box needs to talk about the period around 1400 - can you make sure that's on Keith's radar screen. I believe that historians talk about the Medieval Period going to at least 1450, so what the heck... I you can adjust the caption to work, and then send both it and the final fig to \u00d8yvind, me and Eystein that would be good - make sure Keith is ok with it all first, too. Thanks Tim!

{"text":"Dole alone in not shunning GOP convention By Ben Kamisar Only one former Republican presidential nominee is slated to attend this summer's GOP convention, leaving the party with few elders to preach unity around presumptive nominee Donald Trump . Bob Dole, the party's 1996 nominee who lost to President Bill Clinton , has confirmed he expects to attend the convention. His law firm Alston & Bird plans to hold a reception at the event. ADVERTISEMENT Both George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush announced Wednesday night that they would not attend the Cleveland convention, while Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) revealed weeks ago he will skip it. Aides to Mitt Romney confirmed to The Hill on Thursday that he too would not attend. The lack of former nominees reflects the divisions between establishment party leaders and Trump, who Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus referred to Tuesday as the party's \"presumptive nominee.\" \"It sends the message that there's a split in the Republican Party at the highest levels on their disapproval for Trump. That isn't helpful for enthusiasm,\" GOP strategist Ron Bonjean said. \"It's very clear that this is because they disagree with Trump on his policies and politics, and they don't want to be associated with him either for political or legacy reasons.\" Trump has certainly not played nice with the three most recent nominees. He warred with Romney earlier this year after the 2012 GOP nominee bashed Trump in a speech. Last summer, he mocked McCain's war hero status. And earlier this year, he blamed George W. Bush for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While an aide to George H.W. Bush noted that the former president's mobility issues would prevent him from attending, other aides didn't specifically elaborate on why the former candidates wouldn't be traveling to Cleveland. Romney's absence breaks a long trend of former nominees handing the torch off to the party's new standard bearer. The the most recent previous nominee has spoken to the convention audience in each of the last five conventions. The only one not to attend personally was President Bush in 2008, as he was in the midst of responding to Hurricane Gustav.

{"text":"Hi Phil et al, Re, Malcolm co-authorship--big oversight on my part. Can you ask Ellen if we can add his name (i.e., just say it was 'accidentally left off'), where it belongs alphabetically in the list. I've talked to Malcolm on the phone. The PC #1 *is* the right one--but Malcolm has raised the valid point that we need to cover our behinds on what was done here, lest we be vulnerable to the snipings of the Idsos and co (i.e., that non-climatic influences on recent growth were nominally dealt w\/, as in MBH99). Malcolm is supposed to be sending some text to Phil. So, can we incorporate his small bit of text, and add his name, and then resubmit to AGU ASAP? Thanks all for all the help here. Now, I better get back to my newlywed wife! mike At 05:25 PM 6\/20\/2003 +0100, Phil Jones wrote: Mike, Malcolm has just called Keith. He's been with Ray. Apart from probably being a little miffed off he's not on the article, he says that the W. US series in Figure 2 is wrong. He says it looks the first PC (which I said it was), but that this isn't the corrected one (for CO2 growth effects). Can you check whether it is the right one? Malcolm says that Idso (who was on E&E) will say that the increase in that series is not climatic but due to fertilization. This would not look good obviously. Idso was on a paper with Don Graybill re fertilisation effects on bristlecones. If you need to send a revised series for this top series in Fig 2 then send it to Tim. Tim has done this plot so can make the alterations if another series is needed. If you think that the series is OK then we'll leave it.

{"text":"thanks Kevin, yes, it's a matter of what question one is asking. to argue that the observed global mean temperature anomalies of the past decade falsifies the model projections of global mean temperature change, as contrarians have been fond of claiming, is clearly wrong. but that doesn't mean we can explain exactly what's going on. there is always the danger of falling a bit into the \"we don't know everything, so we know nothing\" fallacy. hence, I wanted to try to clarify where we all agree, and where there may be disagreement, mike On Oct 14, 2009, at 10:36 AM, Kevin Trenberth wrote: Mike Here are some of the issues as I see them: Saying it is natural variability is not an explanation. What are the physical processes? Where did the heat go? We know there is a build up of ocean heat prior to El Nino, and a discharge (and sfc T warming) during late stages of El Nino, but is the observing system sufficient to track it? Quite aside from the changes in the ocean, we know there are major changes in the storm tracks and teleconnections with ENSO, and there is a LOT more rain on land during La Nina (more drought in El Nino), so how does the albedo change overall (changes in cloud)? At the very least the extra rain on land means a lot more heat goes into evaporation rather than raising temperatures, and so that keeps land temps down: and should generate cloud. But the resulting evaporative cooling means the heat goes into atmosphere and should be radiated to space: so we should be able to track it with CERES data. The CERES data are unfortunately wonting and so too are the cloud data. The ocean data are also lacking although some of that may be related to the ocean current changes and burying heat at depth where it is not picked up. If it is sequestered at depth then it comes back to haunt us later and so we should know about it. Kevin Michael Mann wrote: Kevin, that's an interesting point. As the plot from Gavin I sent shows, we can easily account for the observed surface cooling in terms of the natural variability seen in the CMIP3 ensemble (i.e. the observed cold dip falls well within it). So in that sense, we can \"explain\" it. But this raises the interesting question, is there something going on here w\/ the energy & radiation budget which is inconsistent with the modes of internal variability that leads to similar temporary cooling periods within the models. I'm not sure that this has been addressed--has it? m On Oct 14, 2009, at 10:17 AM, Kevin Trenberth wrote: Hi Tom How come you do not agree with a statement that says we are no where close to knowing where energy is going or whether clouds are changing to make the planet brighter. We are not close to balancing the energy budget. The fact that we can not account for what is happening in the climate system makes any consideration of geoengineering quite hopeless as we will never be able to tell if it is successful or not! It is a travesty! Kevin Tom Wigley wrote: Dear all, At the risk of overload, here are some notes of mine on the recent lack of warming. I look at this in two ways. The first is to look at the difference between the observed and expected anthropogenic trend relative to the pdf for unforced variability. The second is to remove ENSO, volcanoes and TSI variations from the observed data. Both methods show that what we are seeing is not unusual. The second method leaves a significant warming over the past decade. These sums complement Kevin's energy work. Kevin says ... \"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't\". I do not agree with this. Tom. +++++++++++++++++++++++ Kevin Trenberth wrote: Hi all Well I have my own article on where the heck is global warming? We are asking that here in Boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record. We had 4 inches of snow. The high the last 2 days was below 30F and the normal is 69F, and it smashed the previous records for these days by 10F. The low was about 18F and also a record low, well below the previous record low. This is January weather (see the Rockies baseball playoff game was canceled on saturday and then played last night in below freezing weather). Trenberth, K.

[PDF] (A PDF of the published version can be obtained from the author.) The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate. That said there is a LOT of nonsense about the PDO. People like CPC are tracking PDO on a monthly basis but it is highly correlated with ENSO. Most of what they are seeing is the change in ENSO not real PDO. It surely isn't decadal. The PDO is already reversing with the switch to El Nino. The PDO index became positive in September for first time since Sept 2007. see [2] g_current.ppt Kevin Michael Mann wrote: extremely disappointing to see something like this appear on BBC. its particularly odd, since climate is usually Richard Black's beat at BBC (and he does a great job). from what I can tell, this guy was formerly a weather person at the Met Office.

{"text":"Good Morning, I pray that all is well with you this morning. I wanted to share a prophetic word with you on this morning that went forth after our Building Fund committee meeting last night. (As shared with me by our First Lady, Edith Wallace). Bro Andrew shared a word that we as a people are to follow our Moses that God has given us and that God is calling all things to order. He stated that when the Pastor speaks and gives a word of instructions, we are to listen and stop bickering amongst ourselves like the children of Israel and follow the man of God. He, Bro Andrew stated that God said that if we as a church would unite and pray for the Pastor and his wife for the next 21 days at 3:00 and everyone be on one accord, God said that He would move mightily. This will be shared in an announcement on Sunday to let the church know, this would be in line of things and that the church needs to get to a point of obedience, because one of the reason why the church has gone around the mountain is because things have been out of order. God is an awesome God and we want to give Him thanks for what He doing. Please forward this information to as many people with contact information before Sunday. Because this is something that we as a people can begin doing today and share the Word with the congregation on Sunday. Have a wonderful God Blessed Day, Denise","label":0}

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: Dale Pike rhinopez@aol.com Site #125: Dawn Clemons dclemons7@home.com Site #126: Carol Cohen Opp0rtunity@aol.com SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: Dennis damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter. As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person doing the page is always good. We need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message. I did not like the background colour, however that is personal, it did not detract from the information. I was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also are errors in the following paragraphs : \"first com-first serve\" and \"to place a sponsor advertisement, send your to my email\" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 points size which gets difficult to read. ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads. ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

QUESTIONS: From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com Subject: Using pictures as links I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures. How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. Mark moviebuff@cliffhanger.com ANSWERS: From: Zaak - Zaako@linkpaks.com Subject: Access using a proxy >From: CJ (cj5000@post.com) >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is blocking 50% of the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then from there you surf Through\/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP\/Corporate providers and because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: Dale Pike rhinopez@aol.com Site #125: Dawn Clemons dclemons7@home.com Site #126: Carol Cohen Opp0rtunity@aol.com SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: Dennis damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter. As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person doing the page is always good. We need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message. I did not like the background colour, however that is personal, it did not detract from the information. I was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also are errors in the following paragraphs : \"first com-first serve\" and \"to place a sponsor advertisement, send your to my email\" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 points size which gets difficult to read. ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads. ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

Great explainer, including how trump's language is dog whistling From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 12:29 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Vox: trumps's trans position is incoherent Donald Trump's position on transgender rights is incoherent, not \"nuanced\" The Washington Post picked an interesting word to describe Donald Trump's new position on legal protections for transgender people: \"nuanced.\" A better word, however, might be \"incoherent.\" Trans people are \"a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the population,\" Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be left to the states, most of which he said would \"make the right decisions.\" So he would rescind the Obama administration's guidelines telling federally funded schools to respect the rights of trans people, including their right to use a bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. In other words, Trump thinks trans people should be protected by the law, but he wants to take away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in public schools. Pressed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old mantra of \"states' rights.\" As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sense if there's something local and state governments can do better than the federal government, or if it would be too burdensome or unwieldy for the federal government to get involved. A good example of that: fire departments. There's really no reason to think a federal fire department would be particularly more effective in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some exceptions may apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income areas.) Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history and current experience make that very clear. States have and still are failing at prohibiting discrimination We have seen how this plays out already - in the 1960s, when the federal government had to step in to force schools to stop discriminating against black people. It's one of the big reasons the Civil Rights Act passed in the first place. Similarly, the federal government passed Title IX in the 1970s after it became clear that states were failing to ensure equal opportunities for women in schools. Now the country is seeing the same kind of failure with trans people. For one, most states do not have explicit anti-discrimination protections for trans people in the workplace, housing, education, or public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public). So it's not explicitly illegal under most states' laws to fire, evict, or refuse service to someone entirely because she's trans. In fact, some states are actively discriminating against trans people. That's what North Carolina did when it passed a law that banned local nondiscrimination ordinances that include sexual orientation and gender identity, and banned trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. Some people might wonder why denying trans people access to the bathroom for their gender identity is discrimination. It's simple: Forcing trans people to use the bathroom that doesn't align with their gender identity acts as a reminder that, as far as society has come on some LGBTQ issues, it's still not completely willing to accept trans people and their identities - even if trans people pose no danger to anyone else . So to trans people, this is just another slight by society. And it's a slight most states allow - and that North Carolina explicitly embraced. This is why the Obama administration got involved. If the country believes that anti-LGBTQ discrimination should be illegal (and majorities do in every state ), but states aren't stopping that discrimination from happening, it makes sense for the federal government - which has historically done this when states fail - to intervene, especially in schools the federal government funds. That's exactly what happened. Trump's position sounds more like a dodge [Donald Trump in West Virginia.]Mark Lyons\/Getty ImagesDonald Trump in West Virginia. Given this history and Trump's position, it's odd that Trump would say this issue should be left to the states. It does, however, make sense if you see it as a dodge. After all, \"states' rights\" has long been the mantra of national-level politicians who want to stay out of touchy issues when they know where the country or their party is going. For example, Hillary Clinton said in 2006 that same-sex marriage should be left up to the states . And John McCain said the same of same-sex marriage in 2008. Trump seems to be in a similar position. He says he wants to protect trans people. But he probably realizes that some members of the Republican Party, particularly religious conservatives, wouldn't appreciate that position. So \"states' rights\" it is. TJ Helmstetter Deputy Director of Regional and Specialty Media Democratic National Committee 202.863.8022 - desk 973.464.9224 - cell HelmstetterT@DNC.org","label":0}

{"text":"Hi Simon, Philip, Eduardo & Gerd (cc Keith), I thought you might be interested in a brief report back from the recent Wengen meeting, specifically about how SO&P-funded work on pseudo-proxies was covered and related hockey-stick issues. **Please don't circulate this further, because it is just my personal viewpoint** Thanks for letting me show some of your material. I skipped over some graphs I took from Philip's regression presentation at the SO&P meeting because Francis Zwiers covered forward\/inverse\/total least squares before me. I did show some results from Eduardo, including pseudo-proxy results from Erik-II. And I showed a figure from Gerd's \"many flavours\" pseudo-proxy paper. The meeting included fairly intensive discussions about many issues, and this included some discussion of von Storch et al. (2004, 2006), Wahl et al. (2006), Mann et al. (2005), Burger and Cubasch (2005) and Burger et al. (2006). Generally the discussion was quite open, with only a few disdainful remarks made about the work of people not there -- certainly not enough to distract from useful discussions. In general, most people accepted that the MBH method could, in some situations, result in biased reconstructions with too little low-frequency. I'm not sure how much Mike Mann accepted this, but it was reinforced by findings shown by Eugene Wahl that indicated some bias in their CSM pseudo-proxy studies, and particularly by Francis Zwiers who looked to have almost completely replicated the von Storch et al. results with respect to the MBH method (though he emphasised the preliminary nature of his work and he may not have implemented the MBH method correctly... we'll have to wait and see). Mike showed many detailed psuedo-proxy tests of the RegEM method and these seemed quite convincing in showing little problem with that method... it does assume equal error in both instrumental and proxies, so it should show less bias than other methods that wrongly put all the error in the instrumental record (i.e., \"typical\" regression). So... there was some confusion about how the MBH method can be biased but the RegEM not be biased (in pseudo-proxy tests) yet they give the same results for the real proxies. Mike thought it might be the ECHO-G vs CSM differences, but I argued against this and was supported by Caspar Ammann and Eugene Wahl who did not think that the character of the model runs was a big factor in explaining different results. There was limited discussion of trend\/detrend and white\/red noise pseudo-proxy issues. Many seemed to think that if pseudo-proxy studies showed that detrending definitely caused a problem, then this was a reason not to detrend. The alternative of finding a method that worked with detrended data was not really discussed. The discussion was fairly constructive and for the most part friendly. Eugene Wahl in particular seemed keen to \"build bridges\" within the community. I should also mention two of the workshop outcomes. The first is that a paper is being planned based on the things discussed at the workshop and covering many issues from proxy data, forcings, model simulations and reconstructions. I hope that the authorship of this might be wider than just the participants of the workshop, but we will have to wait and see who else is asked to contribute. The second is that we should set up a \"climate reconstruction challenge\". The idea would be to use a simulation (*not* of the last 1000 years, so none of us know the expected answer) and provide some data from a \"calibration period\" and some \"pseudo-proxies\" from the full period and make these public so that anyone could attempt to make a reconstruction using their favoured method(s). The true model NH temperature series would be kept secret for 6 months or so. Thus it would be a \"blind\" test and after attempts had been submitted they would be evaluated against the true result to assess which methods were most successful. Caspar Ammann will probably provide the simulation, so he wouldn't take part in making any reconstructions. He would keep the details secret from all others so that any one, including MBH, you and us, could enter the challenge. Finally, it was asked whether the model runs that have so far been used for pseudo-proxy studies (NCAR CSM, ECHO-G Erik-I, HadCM3, maybe ECHO-G Erik-II?) might be made publicly available for shared use, so results are less model dependent. This would just be the surface air temperature fields from the runs, not all the other variables. What do you think, Simon and Eduardo? If you are happy with this then they could get them from the SO&P website, so no need for data extraction on your part. Hope you find this summary interesting. It's just my opinions. I've cc'd this to Keith in case he wants to say anything different! Cheers Tim","label":0}

Bernie Sanders \u2014 seats on a key convention platform committee \u2014 but it may not be enough to stop Sanders from picking a fight over the party's policy positions. Allies of both Clinton and Sanders have urged Democratic leaders to meet some of Sanders's more mundane demands for greater inclusion at the Philadelphia convention. Their decision to do so is expected to be finalized by the end of the week, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But growing mistrust between Sanders supporters and party leaders have threatened to undermine that effort. Even with the committee assignments, Sanders plans an aggressive effort to extract platform concessions on key policies that could prompt divisive battles at a moment when front-runner Hillary Clinton will be trying to unify the party. Among other issues, he plans to push for a $15 national minimum wage and argue that the party needs a more balanced position regarding Israel and Palestinians, according to a Sanders campaign aide who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Much like their view that the economy has been \"rigged\" to benefit the wealthy more than the middle and working classes, Sanders supporters have become increasingly convinced that national Democrats have stacked the political deck with rules that have made it difficult for Sanders to win enough delegates to threaten Clinton's nomination. Party leaders, meanwhile, have grown more frustrated with Sanders, who they say has unfairly fueled that perception. \"I don't think they've handled it very well and I think they've lost the moral high ground on this,\" said Ken Martin, chairman of Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer Labor Party. \"It's very clear now that the longer they stay in this race the more damage they're doing.\" The mistrust hit a boiling point in Nevada over the weekend, when a ruckus caused by Sanders supporters prompted security officials to cut short the state party convention. The incident worried party leaders impatient with the prolonged Democratic primary and looking to avoid drama in Philadelphia. Their impatience spread to Sanders when he issued a defiant statement accusing Nevada Democrats of preventing a \"fair and transparent process.\" Separately, the composition of three convention committees \u2014 platform, rules and credentials \u2014 has become key. Earlier this month, in a letter to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Sanders threatened to bring the fight to the floor of the convention if she did not appoint more of his loyalists to the each of the three committees. Martin and other Democratic chairmen urged national leaders to give Sanders the concessions he seeks \u2014 especially when it comes to the platform, which in the long run does not have a material impact on Democrats' electoral chances in November. \"There are other chairs who probably feel that way and feel like this is my party and f--- Bernie Sanders,\" said Martin, a Clinton supporter. \"I'm not one of those. \"I feel very passionately that we have to open up that party and make sure that those voices are heard,\" he said. One of Sanders's demands was the composition of the 15-person drafting committee, whose members are appointed at Wasserman Schultz's discretion and write the party's platform. Play Video1 One Democratic Party official requesting anonymity said Wasserman Schultz asked for recommendations from both campaigns in an effort to be inclusive. But Sanders had sought to split the committee evenly between his and Clinton's allies \u2014 plus one \"neutral\" appointment from Wasserman Schultz. Weeks of negotiations followed, and the DNC eventually agreed to add more Sanders representatives. According to two people familiar with the conversations, the DNC and the campaigns will reach a final agreement \u2014 probably less than Sanders wanted but more than the DNC originally offered \u2014 by the end of the week. A spokesman for the DNC declined to comment on the negotiations. Sanders's aides have also publicly and privately complained about the appointment of two Clinton loyalists \u2014 former congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts to head the Rules Committee and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy to lead the Platform Committee \u2014 as chairmen of two of the convention's standing bodies. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, said this week that they may yet seek to have Frank and Malloy removed from their posts. In an interview with CNN Thursday, Clinton noted pointedly that she believes Sanders no longer has a shot at the nomination. She also said that Sanders will need to encourage his supporters to unify behind her, just as she did in 2008 when running against Barack Obama. \"I have every confidence that we're going to be unified,\" Clinton said. \"I think what brings us together is Donald Trump.\" That hasn't happened yet. A Sanders spokesman disputed Clinton's assertion that the nomination is hers. And Sanders has ramped up the rhetoric in recent days, saying after Clinton won Kentucky that he still intends to win the nomination despite an overwhelming disadvantage in delegates. Even if he doesn't, he still intends to pick a platform fight at the convention, according to a campaign aide who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. Clinton aides have said that on a slew of issues, Sanders is not far from the party. But the issue of U.S. policy toward Israel \u2014 which a Sanders adviser said \"absolutely, legitimately will be a point of conversation\" \u2014 has made some of Clinton's backers nervous. Sanders is seeking a more \"even-handed\" U.S. approach to Israeli occupation of land Palestinians claim for a future state. The current platform does not address the nearly five-decade occupation directly, but it endorses \"a just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian accord, producing two states for two peoples.\" Speaking last month during a contentious debate with Clinton, Sanders \u2014 who declared himself \"100 percent pro-Israel\" \u2014 said that Israel's 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was \"disproportionate\" to the threat posed by Hamas rockets launched from the Palestinian territory into Israel. Behind his words is a long debate among U.S. and international policymakers \u2014 one that divides the Democratic base and could pose a challenge for Clinton when she must bring her party together: how to weigh Palestinian interests when dealing with Israel, and whether resolute U.S. backing for Israel diminishes leverage to promote peace and fair treatment of Palestinians. \"On one hand there is not an enormous amount of difference between them. They are both pro-Israel, they are both pro-peace,\" said one longtime Clinton supporter. \"But in the context of the campaign terms like 'even-handed' can come to mean that the United States is signaling a shift\" \u2014 and Clinton would oppose that.","label":0}

{"text":"Hi all, I'm halfway through these changes and will get the revised figures out to you probably tomorrow, except maybe the SH one, because: I'm not sure if the van Ommen (pers. comm.) data shown by Jones & Mann and suggested by Riccardo are the data to use or not. Is it published properly? I've seen the last 700 years of the Law Dome 18O record published, so perhaps we should show just the period since 1300 AD? That period appears in: Mayewski PA, Maasch KA, White JWC, et al.

Increase font sizes for axis numbering and axis labeling - all are too small. You can figure out the best size by reducing figs to likely page size minus margins. We guess the captions need to be bigger by a couple increments at least. yes Figure 6.11. 1. This one is in pretty good shape except that Ricardo has to determine if S. African boreholes need to be removed. I think Henry said they were published and could stay Figure 6.12 1. again, please delete S. African borehole if Ricardo indicates it's still not published. I think Henry said they could stay. 2. consider adding Law Dome temperature record - Ricardo is investigating, but perhaps Keith\/Tim can help figure out if it's valid to include. Feel free to check with Valerie on this too, as she seems to know these data at least a little Already discussed above. 3. also, please increase font sizes and make sure they match 6.10 - probably better to use bold fonts You are right that I've mixed bold and non-bold. When reduced to small size, the non-bold actually read more clearly than the bold, I think, so I'll standardise on non-bold. It's not possible to completely standardise on the size, because each figure I provide might be scaled by different amounts. I don't know final figure size, so will make a good guess. Should be ok. Figure 6.13 1. we are going to split the existing 6.13 into two figure. The first is 100% Tim's fig., and is just an upgrade of the existing 6.13 a-d, with the only changes being: 1a. delete the old ECHO-G red dashed line curve in panel d, and Keith says this was discussed and rejected, so I should keep old ECHO-G in? 1b. please also increase font sizes and make sure they match 6.10 and 12 - please use bold fonts. ok, as discussed above. 2. The existing 6.13e is going to become a new 6.14, with the addition of a new forcings panel \"a\" on top of the existing panel e (which becomes 6.14b). To make this happen, Tim and Fortunat have to coordinate, as Tim has the forcing data (and knows what we what) and Tim has the existing figure. We suspect it will be easier for Fortunat to give Tim data and layout advice, and for Tim to make a figure that matches the other figs he's doing. PLEASE NOTE that this fig can't be as large as the existing 6.13a-d, but needs to be more compact to permit its inclusion. done. Cheers Tim","label":0}

However ,WB has already offered FOCUS at the same period. We asked SMT to persuade WB into changing the release date of FOCUS and we are just waiting for their reply now. The reason why we want to release it from May 16th is because we should not go with Avengers 2 or Fast & Furious 7. Please see the competitors release date as follows; The Man From U.N.C.L.E.

Re : HOTEL T 2 We were planning to release it from Sep 19. But due to PIXELS releasing, our tentative release date is Oct.10. It is not the holiday season and there are only 2 national holidays in four weeks. The final box office of the previous one was 138 M JPY so we should be careful spending money on HOTEL T 2.

The Republican Party's Worst Week in Washington [ (AP Photo\/Mosa'ab Elshamy) This is the week that the Republican Party's worst nightmare came true: Donald Trump emerged as the presumptive presidential nominee after crushing the competition in Indiana's GOP primary. The party didn't handle it so well. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan kicked it all off, telling CNN's Jake Tapper that he simply can't support Trump yet . \"I'm just not ready to do that at this point,\" Ryan said. \"I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to.\" The hits just kept coming. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, a one-time presidential candidate, quickly made clear that his criticism of Trump wouldn't end now that the real estate mogul was the party's only remaining choice. \"I also cannot in good conscience support Donald Trump because I do not believe he is a reliable Republican conservative,\" Graham said as a part of an extended tweetstorm explaining why he wouldn't be voting for his party's nominee or attending the national convention in July. 5-Minute Fix newsletter Keeping up with politics is easy now. Graham's announcement was quickly followed by a similar one from Jeb Bush. In a Facebook post , Bush lambasted Trump as someone \" who has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy.\" Trump was positively Trumpian in his response to all of the mishigas he has created within the party he will represent this fall. A Trump spokeswoman suggested that it might be time for someone other than Ryan to be speaker . And Trump unleashed this doozy on Graham : \"Every time I see Lindsey Graham spew hate during interviews, I ask why the media never questions how I single-handedly destroyed his hapless run for president.\" What's next is anybody's guess. The party appears to be teetering on the edge of a full-blown split between those who believe that now that the voters have spoken it's time to get behind Trump and those who view backing the billionaire as an abandonment of the true principles of conservatism. And there's no one able stop it. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has the most difficult job in America. Trump lacks the unity gene. Lots of other eminences grises within the party -- the Bushes, Bob Dole, and so on and so forth -- are on opposite sides of the divide and seem to have no interest in serving as a bridge. That means it's likely that the schism will get worse before it gets better. If it gets better. A party being torn in two is bad enough. That process happening within 184 days until a presidential election and in full view of the general public is even worse. And this might not even be the bottom yet.

{"text":"Hi Stefan and Fortunat: Attached are the draft figs that include proxy obs, simulations, and comparisons of the two. As you can see, Tim just sent them. Big job, but they look great in my eyes. See Tim's email below for more background info. We need fast feedback from you both, specifically: 1) any general comments on the figs - this is a crux set of figures and we need your eyes to look at them carefully 2) is it wise to keep the new EMIC run panel attached to the second figure as attached? I vote yes, but what do you think. It fits w\/ the other panels pretty well. 3) either way, we need caption prose from you (perhaps Fortunat start, and Stefan edit, or vice versa if Stefan can start first) on the new EMIC panel. 4) also, we need a new para, or prose that can be added to a para, that describes the panel and it's implications as it informs our assessment. Keith will then integrate this into the section. I'm not sure of this, but perhaps you could start with a new question heading, and then have a short para to go under it - something like \"What is the significance of the new reduced-amplitude estimates of past solar variability?\" Of course, we need your feedback and prose asap.

I know you reached out to me last month looking for a good investment amid this crazy market. I must tell you it has been very hard to find something solid. Theres very few hidden gems out there and I honestly didnt even think I would be able to find something. That being said the best Ive been able to find is RNBI and when I say best, it really seems to be a god send. I told a few of my other clients about it last month as it seemed pretty cheap and it has gone up by more than 50% since. Im giving you a heads up on RNBI because I spoke with a few of my colleagues and they agree that it will hit a dollar some time in the coming weeks. Dont tell anyone you hear this from me please we're suppose to keep it on the down low. The company operates in the legalhemp industry, apparently the sector has been going nuts since colorado and washington made the stuff legal and apparently RNBI is going to announce some big news soon. Not sure what it is but my source is usually pretty spot on. Take care and let me know if you need anything else. Ill keep you posted if I have some more news. (c) 2014. StockTips.

{"text":"Suggest flipping to add personalization higher up. See below. From: Walsh, Tom Sent: Monday, May 09, 2016 7:00 PM To: Miranda, Luis; Walker, Eric; Paustenbach, Mark Subject: For edits: Draft sample op-ed Sample Trump Op-Ed Divisive, Reckless and Dangerous: The Trump-Ryan Agenda is a Recipe for Disaster (Key Issues: Taxes, Economy, Women's Health, Immigration) Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing in the world, make our communities less safe, and leave the working families of [State] behind. He is divisive, dangerous, and he lacks the judgment and temperament to be president. In states with Republican state leadership: Here in the state of [XXX], we already know the damage Republican leadership can do. Governor [XXX], and\/or the Republican-led legislature have implemented more of the same backwards policies from the Republican playbook. (state-specific examples) We need Democratic leadership to carry us forward. In states with Democratic state leadership: Here in the state of [XXX], Governor [XXX], and\/or the Democratic-led legislature have fought for policies that have expanded opportunity, protected civil rights and helped working families prosper. (state-specific examples) What Trump is promising is what we already know we can expect from the GOP. For years the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. And despite his best attempts at portraying himself as an independent outsider with new ideas, he has embraced the same disastrous, failed policies that today's top GOP leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have long fought for. A Trump presidency would advance Ryan's policies, erase the real economic progress of the last seven years under President Obama, hurt working families, turn back the clock on women's health, and deepen divisions on immigration reform. Both Trump and Ryan would block an increase in the minimum wage. Both have vowed to defund or shutdown Planned Parenthood. Trump has made absurd claims about building a \"great wall\" on our southern border, while Ryan has voted repeatedly for building a border wall. Both have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million Americans. And both men have proposed tax plans that would overwhelmingly benefit the rich and slash the top income tax rate to 25 percent. Trump's tax plan would cost the country $9.5 trillion to implement - more than any other Republican plan proposed - while violating his own pledge to eliminate the national debt. This week as Trump and Ryan meet at RNC headquarters, presumably in an attempt to repair the damage of their vicious primary, it's a stark reminded that the Trump-Ryan agenda is a real threat, and that if we allow it to take hold over the next four years it would come at a severe cost for the vast majority of Americans. A Trump presidency would only drag us backwards. His campaign has damaged America's relationships across the globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign, and at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. His business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the American people can't afford to let him get anywhere near the White House. When the last Republican president left office, our economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month. The Trump-Ryan agenda is offering more of the same, or worse, and the American people cannot afford to let Trump bully his way into the Oval Office. We need to elect more Democratic leadership from the top of the ticket down to build on the progress of the last seven years under President Obama - with 74 straight months of private sector job growth, the longest streak on record, and 14 million new jobs created. Republicans couldn't unite against Trump and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until Election Day on November 8th.","label":0}

{"text":"Several of us fielded radio interviews today also, but here is more... Denied a permit, the National Socialist Movement plans to hold rally during football game. Denied a permit, the National Socialist Movement plans to hold rally during football game. By Daniel Ramey Sept. 9, 2008 Despite being denied a permit to hold a parade, a local neo-Nazi group said it still intends to hold a rally in Columbia during an upcoming MU home football game, but police said they are trying to reach an agreement with the groupw. In a letter addressed to Interim Columbia Police Chief Tom Dresner, the mid-Missouri chapter of the National Socialist Movement stood firm on its right to march in Columbia on Nov. 8. The Columbia Police Department denied the group's request for a parade permit last week because MU is scheduled to host a home football game against Kansas State on that day. The department said in a news release that the two events would overburden police resources on that date. \"We do intend to come on Nov. 8 with or without a permit,\" NSM national director Jeff Schoep said in the letter. \"It is our legal right, and we can do a walking picket on city sidewalks according to law.\" Schoep said the group would seek legal injunction against the City of Columbia if the group was not allowed to march. \"If the NSM is forced back into the courts to challenge a violation of our rights once again, I will free up every last dime we have at our disposal to hire the absolute best attorney we can find in the state of Missouri,\" he said in the letter. Schoep then cited instances when the group had taken legal action against the cities of Orlando and Toledo, Ohio, and had earned a permit to march after originally being denied one. Representatives from the NSM met with CPD on Monday as part of an appeal to the denial of their request. According to a statement released by Dresner on Monday, discussions are continuing between the NSM and the department, and Dresner said it would not comment on the issue until they are \"recontacted by the NSM regarding their intentions\" and an agreement is reached between the two parties. Lt. Charles Wilson, leader of the NSM's stormtroopers division, estimated that there were already 120 people who had booked plane tickets or were planning to drive to the event on Nov. 8. The group's goal with the march is to protest illegal immigration, Wilson said. \"We will be there,\" he said. Schoep also attacked how the police department handled the denial. He contested the validity of a football game as a reason to deny the permit and attacked the manner in which the group was informed of the denial. \"It has been noted that your department informed the press of the initial denial of our permit,\" Schoep said in the letter. \"Yet, we had not been informed by your department if the permit was approved or denied. The media informed us, so we assume that it may not even be true.\" Schoep wrote that the letter was being sent by U.S. Postal Service on Monday to the police department but was released to the media via e-mail beforehand. Despite the group's criticism with how the denial was handled, it said it is still willing to compromise with the city. \"If you are willing to negotiate with us on the terms of the rally, and time, we are open to amend within reason,\" Schoep said in the letter. One change the group was willing to make, he said, would be to cut down the march from the original five hours it requested. Dresner said the two sides were supposed to meet to discuss the matter on Monday. \u00ab Previous Entry | BoCoMo Buzz Home September 08, 2008 No Neo-nazi Fanfare I know our cops reporter, Joe Meyer, has already posted on his blog that the neo-Nazis, members of the National Socialist Movement, plan to march in Columbia Nov. 8, but since I wrote the three stories last week, I wanted to share some things expressed to me. I got some angry phone calls - some people were furious that the paper printed the news on the front page, concerned about their kids reading it and finding out what neo-Nazis were. Many people said our city should simply ignore the group and its efforts and stage an alternative event to show opposition. Some said more needs to be done, such as citizens taking action by signing up for membership with organizations the neo-Nazis oppose, such as the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP. I did get one call from a person who wanted to know where to get more information about the group, which he is interested in possibly supporting. As a journalist, I think the media must remain objective to fully serve our readers, but I found an interesting approach while researching community's responses to \"hate\" groups. I was reading about the effort of citizens in Billings, Mont., to combat hate crimes occuring in their city. After one incident in which Jewish people were attacked, the paper ran a full-page ad of a menorah, which residents tore out and posted everywhere as a symbol of unity. Now, I realize this is different because marching is certainly not a crime -- the NSM is as welcome to demonstrate as any other group. And, as a person who lives off the assurance of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, I respect that. But, as Interim Police Chief Tom Dresner pointed out, there is a point where media coverage helps certain groups more than others. The more sensational or outrageous the group, the more coverage, usually. Journalistic principles will most likely give the event lots of coverage that will try to reflect both the NSM's viewpoint and the viewpoint of others. Last year, that amounted to the NSM rally as the top story and the Douglass Park picnic as the secondary story. But, since readers help decide what's newsworthy, I was curious to see what kind of coverage you all would like to see. Filed under: Hot topics Posted by Kat Hughes at 02:48 PM TV news: NBC channel 8 National Socialist Movement Appeal Permit COLUMBIA - Representatives from the National Socialist Movement met with the city manager and Capt. Tom Dresner of the Columbia Police Department to appeal their permit to march and rally to Boone County Courthouse. The Columbia Police Department said many different scenarios have been put forth regarding this potential event, leading to misinformation. The Department said they want to stress that discussions are continuing as part of their appeal of the Sept 2. denial. The Columbia Police Department said they are waiting to be recontacted by the NSM regarding their intentions before they release more information. *:* Caroline Zilk -- Commander Jeff Schoep \"If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.\" National Socialist Movement www.nsm88.org The information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged.

SL: ROUNDUP: Dangerous Donald's Foreign Policy \"Plan\" As he's done throughout his campaign, Dangerous Donald Trump is proving that on foreign policy, he lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. Trump would alienate allies and deal with friend and foe alike with reckless disregard, with poorly conceived ideas that would undermine our national security and make the American people less safe. Don't take our word for it, see what people are saying about his remarks below: A Trump-First Foreign Policy WALL STREET JOURNAL \/\/ His maiden policy speech on Wednesday, devoted to foreign affairs, earns an \"incomplete\" at Trump University. \u2026 The 5,000-word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards, if not his own. The central motif, like all of Mr. Trump's political thought, is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given problem, and everybody else is a pathetic loser, so trust his instincts and temperament. \u2026 For prepared remarks, or for that matter even an after-dinner talk, Mr. Trump's speech was especially rife with contradictions. He said the conduct of foreign policy must be \"more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything.\" He also said the conduct of foreign policy must be \"disciplined, deliberate and consistent.\" \u2026 Mr. Trump isn't known for close readings of his briefing books, if such documents exist, and deep policy knowledge is obviously not the source of his political appeal. But Americans typically prefer Presidents who are conversant about the world's biggest problems beyond a sound bite or two\u2026 Mr. Trump promised to \"win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become President.\" He won't become the GOP nominee much less President if voters don't trust him with nuclear weapons, so a serious if contradictory speech is at least a kind of progress. Donald Trump's Strange Worldview NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ THE EDITORIAL BOARD ... No one's fears are likely to be allayed by this speech, which was clearly worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter. It did not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of the balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history. ... Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assumptions. He's been refuted before on his claim that the Islamic State is making \"millions of dollars a week\" by selling Libyan oil. There is zero evidence of that. The nuclear deal with the United States and other major powers has not made Iran a \"great power,\" nor has Tehran violated the conditions of that pact, as Mr. Trump has said. Mr. Trump says he knows how to negotiate, and to him that seems to mean putting forward maximal positions that he can then walk back. That won't work in foreign policy. Mr. Trump did not display any willingness to learn or to correct his past errors. For someone who claims he is ready to lead the free world, that is inexcusable. Trump's unreal foreign policy: Our view USA TODAY \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertaining, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous. Which is a good place to start with the much-awaited foreign policy speech delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Donald Trump. As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, the Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain class of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to trade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments, and wistful for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world. In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does not exist: America's allies would be more respectful after being lectured to, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.S. disengagement. \u2026 Things might happen that way on TV. But not in reality. Or perhaps we should say real reality. Donald Trump shows dangerously incoherent foreign policy THE SACRAMENTO BEE \/\/ THE EDITORIAL BOARD Then, he gave a rambling, vague and incoherent speech Wednesday full of platitudes and contradictions, and suggested he would undermine international alliances that have helped keep America safe since World War II. It was billed as a major foreign policy address, but voters looking for reassurances about Trump as commander in chief can't feel that much more comfortable. Our longtime allies certainly won't be confident. Don't be fooled by Trump's foreign policy speech WASHINGTON POST \/\/ ANNE APPLEBAUM If you weren't already convinced that parody is now the central art form of our era, then Donald Trump's grand foreign policy speech yesterday was the proof. \u2026 The multiple inconsistencies and internal contradictions have already been listed by others. On the one hand, he said that \"your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.\" On the other hand, he threatened to \"walk\" if those same friends didn't pony up to his demands. He wants to invest heavily in the military, but he wants to stop using the military. He doesn't want to do \"nation-building\" but does want to promote \"regional stability.\" There was no sense that he knew what either of those terms actually meant. \u2026 Anyone who sits down and analyzes the speech from start to finish will, of course, worry about the contradictions, the inconsistencies, the impossible claims, the detachment from reality. From Donald Trump, a Foreign Policy Speech Heavy on Slogans and Light on Details WALL STREET JOURNAL \/\/ AARON DAVID MILLER Those expecting a coherent, well-ordered view of the world and a strategy to match it would have been disappointed listening to Donald Trump's foreign policy address on Wednesday. The speech was a collection of bromides, slogans, aims, and promises wrapped in Mr. Trump's conviction that he can solve America's problems in a cruel and unforgiving world\u2013all without specifying how. \u2026 Nobody expected great detail on how exactly he would accomplish all of his plans. But in what was billed as a major foreign-policy address, the absence of guidance on how he would achieve his goals was striking. The best he could do about better burden sharing with our NATO allies was to suggest a summit to discuss the matter. \u2026 His implication that only he knows how to fix what ails the republic suggests a self-absorption that goes well beyond the normal ego and narcissism required to run for president. Mr. Trump's preference for celebrity (his) over substance and his reliance on one-liners over serious analysis of complicated problems point up potential for conflict, at minimum, should he win the nation's most-demanding job, a position that requires prudence, curiosity, and a willingness not only to ask questions but also to home in on the right ones. Trump struggles to explain 'America first' foreign policy ASSOCIATED PRESS\/\/ LOLITA C. BALDOR AND SAGAR MEGHANI Donald Trump strained to lay out a clear vision of his \"America first\" foreign policy on Wednesday, vowing to substitute hard-headed realism for what he called a post-Cold War era replete with U.S. national security failures. Yet the Republican presidential front-runner outlined no strategy for how he'd make the United States at the same time a \"consistent\" and \"unpredictable\" force in the world. And he didn't appear to allay the concerns of U.S. and international critics \u2014 Republicans at home as well as Democrats \u2014 who see him as unfit for the responsibilities of commander in chief. \u2026 Trump also contradicted his own broad-brush approach to foreign policy. He said at one point that the best way to achieve his goals was through \"disciplined, deliberate and consistent\" policy. Later, however, he exhorted the nation to \"be more unpredictable\" in how it combats enemies. Graham tears into Trump's 'pathetic' foreign policy speech THE HILL \/\/ JESSIE HELLMAN Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tore into Donald Trump's foreign policy address Wednesday in a series of tweets, saying, \"Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave.\" The outspoken senator called Trump's speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington pathetic and incoherent. \"Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face,\" Graham wrote. \"Trump's FP speech not conservative. It's isolationism surrounded by disconnected thought, demonstrates lack of understanding threats we face.\" A Trump-First Foreign Policy WALL STREET JOURNAL \/\/ His maiden policy speech on Wednesday, devoted to foreign affairs, earns an \"incomplete\" at Trump University. \u2026 The 5,000-word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards, if not his own.

{"text":"Trump boasts about 'tremendous cash flow' in new financial report By NICK GASS 05\/17\/16 05:20 PM EDT Updated 05\/17\/16 05:45 PM EDT Donald Trump on Tuesday boasted that he has filed a new personal financial disclosure report, one that shows - according to Trump's campaign - \"tremendous cash flow\" and income in excess of a half a billion dollars. The campaign added in the statement that Trump's net worth has only grown since his first statement last July and that his net worth is now above $10 billion. While the 104-page document is not yet publicly available from the Federal Election Commission, Trump said it is the \"largest in the history of the FEC\" - his prior one was 92 pages - and that his runaway business success is \"the kind of thinking the country needs.\" The statement comes as Trump has come under fire for his refusal to release his tax returns, arguing that it wouldn't be wise of him to do so because some of them are being audited. Trump's first financial disclosure form was hotly anticipated, especially because it came as many weren't sure that he was serious about a run and would lift the veil on his business empire. In his prior filing, Trump reported assets of at least $1.4 billion in real estate and other holdings, income of at least $431 million over the past 18 months from a huge number of sources, and liabilities of at least $265 million, including several mortgages for different Trump properties. The filing, however, did not include his net worth, which Forbes has previously pegged at $4 billion. According to his campaign's statement on Tuesday, Trump's latest filing includes income \"in excess of $557 million\" and \"a revenue increase of approximately $190 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties).\" The statement does not make reference to Trump's charitable contributions. Some have suspected that questions about his generosity could be behind his reluctance to release his tax returns. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told CNN shortly after the statement was issued that Trump has \"given over $100 million away in charitable giving over the last number of years, and we've been very public about that.\" \"And as you know, he raised money for the veterans, he personally pledged and donated $1 million alone. So Mr. Trump's financial giving to charitable organizations is unquestioned. He's done over $100 million in the last number of years. And I think by any accounts a lot of money. I think many, many organizations have benefited from his ability to give to those groups and he'll continue to do more,\" Lewandowski said, noting that those figures included contributions made personally and through his foundation. Trump in the statement also took a shot at Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, whose campaign last month asked for a 45-day extension on submitting the report. \"Despite the fact that I am allowed extensions, I have again filed my report, which is 104 pages, on time. Bernie Sanders has requested, on the other hand, an extension for his small report. This is the difference between a businessman and the all talk, no action politicians that have failed the American people for far too long,\" Trump said. \"I have built an incredible company and have accumulated one of the greatest portfolios of real estate assets, many of which are considered to be among the finest and most iconic properties in the world.\" Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org","label":0}

{"text":"Saved here: Ezra From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 7:39 PM To: Comm_D Cc: djtspeaks@hillaryclinton.com Subject: Video Request: Trump Denied Dating Model, Called Her a 'F**king Third-Rate Hooker' Please Save embedded audio Trump Denied Dating Model, Called Her a 'F**king Third-Rate Hooker' Victoria Zdrok claimed Donald Trump was a narcissist who wore too much hairspray. He claimed never to have met her, and that she was unattractive to date. In a public-spirited exercise in gossip archeology, D-list celebrity interviewer and former 'Howard Stern Show ' regular Chaunce Hayden, the publisher of Metropolis Nights magazine , has rediscovered a 12-year-old recording of his phone call with Donald Trump concerning a Playboy and Penthouse model Trump claimed never to have dated. While Hayden has previously marketed his chat with The Donald to various and sundry web sites over the years (Radar Online and Gawker included), it is well worth taking out of mothballs now that the reality show billionaire is the presumptive Republican nominee with a shot at being elected president of the United States. The model in question is Victoria Zdrok , 43, a Ukranian-born former Playboy Playmate and Penthouse Pet who, in a 2004 interview with Hayden, published in his now-defunct magazine Stepping Out, was less than charitable about her close encounter with the man who will likely face former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 general election. In the interview, Zdrok claimed Trump had called Playboy to get a date with her, and they \"ended up going out four times.\" She said she had gotten a call from Playboy Promotions saying Trump was \"looking for a new girl for his ad campaign for one of his casinos in Atlantic City\u2026It turns out he was never actually looking for a model. He was just trying to pick me up.\" \"First of all, he's really arrogant,\" Zdrok told Hayden. \"He's really into himself! On a date all he does is talk about himself. He loves himself! The first thing he says to me on our date is that he's taller and better looking than what he looks like in pictures, and that people don't realize it. He said, 'People don't realize how handsome I am!' He actually loves himself! I never met a more narcissistic person than Donald. \"You feel just like a piece of jewelry when you're with him. For him it's all about looks, appearances, and signing autographs. He just loves it.\"(Zdrok didn't respond to an email from The Daily Beast; neither did Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks.) While all the above might have a certain ring of familiarity to anyone who has followed the future GOP standard-bearer's Twitter feed, campaign rallies, and debate performances, Trump was at pains to deny, in his phone call with Hayden, that he had even met the woman, let alone dated her. He begged Hayden not to go with the story, but, alas, the real estate and casino mogul\u2014who was starring in NBC's The Apprentice, then in its first season\u2014was less than persuasive. \"Donald Trump wasn't paying my bills,\" Hayden told The Daily Beast. Zdrok also told Hayden that all Trump did on their dates was \"talk about his ex-girlfriends. He couldn't stop talking about Ivana (his first wife) and Marla [Maples, his second wife] and how skinny and horrible Marla looks now and that she looks like shit since she cut her hair off. \"He just loves to talk about which women are in love with him and always calling him. He loves to talk about how women are chasing him all the time, which doesn't make a girl feel special on a date. The other thing he talks about is what a great lover he is. He said to me, 'Once you made love to me, you'll never be able to make love to anybody else.'\" Zdrok, who told Hayden she had not slept with Trump (she did not want to be \"another notch on his belt\"), accused him of being racist. \"He would always talk about this one girl, a supermodel, and how he would give her the best orgasms of her life. And how she misses him so much. He told me he really likes this girl but he would never go out with her because he found out she was half-black and that would be bad for his reputation. I thought that was very racist. \"He didn't like that she was some weird ethnic mix so he wouldn't go out with her publicly, but that he really missed her and she was wonderful in bed. He needed somebody more mainstream.\" (Many pieces have surmised that the supermodel in question was Kara Young, who Trump dated in 2001 .) Judging by Trump's liberal use of curse words and otherwise coarse misogynistic language in his pleadings with Hayden to not publish the interview with Zdrok, he was also\u2014at least by the na\u00efve standards of a simpler time\u2014less than presidential. \"I don't even know who the hell she is,\" Trump insisted to Hayden, after boasting about the ratings of his reality television show. \"It's the biggest thing [NBC has] had sinceFriends.\" In an assertion that, more than a decade later, is unlikely to help his candidacy with Republican women in the suburbs, but will probably have negligible impact on his ardent supporters, Trump said that he could not have possibly gone out with Zdrok because \"she looks like a fucking third-rate hooker. Gimme a break. I never took her out. She's full of shit. Chaunce, look, I have good taste in women. Take a look at her picture. It's all bullshit. I never took her out.\" It was \"bullshit, total bullshit\" that he was considering Zdrok for an advertising campaign, Trump added. \"I use models, not Playboy people for that.\" Trump claimed in the call that Zdrok would call his office \"ten different times, like five years ago,\" asking that he take her out. \"I never took her out, and based on that picture I would never take her out. She's not even attractive, she's not a good-looking girl\u2026 Who the hell wants a Penthouse Pet? Penthouse is gone, it's bankrupt, it's over.\" Being a 35-year-old Penthouse Pet was \"pretty pathetic\" according to Trump. Ever since The Apprentice had become successful had women claiming to be ex-girlfriends materialized, he said. \"Two of them I did date, they said nice things about me,\" Trump said, restating again that Zdrok's claim was \"total bullshit.\" While it would be easier not to make a big deal out of it, Trump said, claims like Zdrok's were \"just so fucking false I don't like them to get away with this crap.\" As for Zdrok, she also claimed to have been up close and personal with Trump's famous, shape- and color-shifting thatch of hair. \"His orange hair was very odd,\" she said. \"He uses so much hair spray. I would never dream of touching it. But he doesn't care. He really thinks he's one of the most handsome people on earth. He really does. \"After four dates I stopped going out with him. I just said, 'I'll call you back' and never did. So he moved on. I just couldn't take hearing about him talk about himself. He's so condescending. There's no romance. It's all about him.\"","label":0}

{"text":"Hi Keith: As you are aware, the situation in Russia is very uncertain with their unfortunate economic condition, especially science support. There is interest, hope, and dots on maps showing intent but actual activity is difficult to judge. In the particular area I am interested in, the Taymyr, there is no current active tree-ring research going on although it has been previously sampled and some reports are in preparation. Ed probably told you that I have submitted a proposal to do work there. My understanding is that unless there is some external funding support, such as my project, tree-ring sampling there is in abeyance. Several people, including yourself, recognize the great potential in the region. From my perspective it seems that the Polar Urals are being studied, Yokutia to the far east is being studied, some work has been done by Szeicz and Macdonald at the Lena but there is need for more intensive effort in Taymyr. I would like to hear your perspective on the situation. In a related topic, I am thinking of using the option in Ed's new ARSTAN to use the regional standardization method. In Russia and other locales the establishment of trees is episodic. In particular, in Alaska Glenn Juday has data showing cohort groups being established in favorable times. In Taymyr also, the establishment of trees is not evenly distributed through time. There are times of growth and times of demise. This concerns me as it could affect the development of a regional curve. do you see problems arising from this? I am also curious to hear any comments you care to make about my recent letter to Fritz Schweingruber. He obviously will pursue any style of sampling and analyses he chooses to. My only contention is that he should not represent his data as the definitive tree-ring information, particularly ring-width data. His opinions are influential but there is an accumulating body of ring-width data that clearly shows him to be missing much important information with his style of sampling. Scientists and others should be aware of this fact. Cheers, Gordon","label":0}

{"text":"Keith, Tim (and friends- please read below and provide your comments THURS too) - just finished reading your draft and my primary reaction is one of great relief and admiration. You've done an excellent job. I'm sure things will look different in the end, but for the ZOD, this lays things out just fine. That said, here are comments. More are in the attached draft w\/ track changes 1. still need to see the figs - ok to state what still has to be done (as you have) 2. regarding the ocean section, I think some of it should stay in - both as a placeholder for other relevant stuff, and because it is important. See attached. It would be good if EYSTEIN would look at my comments for this section and provide the needed minor help - we need the punchline\/bullet - how does the 20th century compare with the previous part of the record (you say it shows the warming, but then don't go the next step. 3. THIS IS THE ONLY COMMENT THAT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES - can we get THE word on the MWP in before hydro? Heck, I'd even support a small (smaller than the other ones) box. There is lots of debate about the MWP,. and we need to weigh in. Was it global, hemispheric, regional only (e.g., Europe and N. Atlantic - can then refer back to it in ocean section)? Was it one synchronous warm event or a bunch of shorter regionally asynchronous events? Warmer than 20th? Late 20th? (think you answered this, but need to nail it!). Cite the cast of papers you've already discussed, plus Bradley et al Science 03. 4. what you say is balanced, and it's ok to note in the text where you anticipate serious improvement w\/ more published paper support - e.g., Esper (you're doing a paper on this, no?) and ECHO-G. 5. have to have boreholes on Figs too - that would be more important now than uncertainty estimates around all recons - the latter is harder, but in any case, say what you intend to add after ZOD. 6. see text - minor edits 7. I can make draft bullets from what you sent Guys - it was worth the wait. Hope you can take advantage of the relatively minor edits required and help some with other sections as asked for. -- Jonathan T.

{"text":"Mike Had a very good meeting with Shell yesterday. Only a minor part of the agenda, but I expect they will accept an invitation to act as a strategic partner and will contribute to a studentship fund though under certain conditions. I now have to wait for the top-level soundings at their end after the meeting to result in a response. We, however, have to discuss asap what a strategic partnership means, what a studentship fund is, etc, etc. By email? In person? I hear that Shell's name came up at the TC meeting. I'm ccing this to Tim who I think was involved in that discussion so all concerned know not to make an independent approach at this stage without consulting me! I'm talking to Shell International's climate change team but this approach will do equally for the new foundation as it's only one step or so off Shell's equivalent of a board level. I do know a little about the Fdn and what kind of projects they are looking for. It could be relevant for the new building, incidentally, though opinions are mixed as to whether it's within the remit.

{"text":"Looping Su Yen, Luis and the talking points that DNC Comms developed. JW ------------ Talking Points on Party Unity: Democrats Overwhelmingly United * Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited about both of our candidates. * By and large we've had a great primary, with substantive candidates whose vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the American people. * And we're going to come out of our convention more unified and stronger than ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party. * Just look at the new poll today from CBS\/New York Times: A new CBS\/NYT poll shows that Democrats are more united today than in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into the 2016 election. The poll showed that 72 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually elected to a landslide victory. Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to Republicans, who are split 55%-43% between \"mostly hopeful\" and \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican Party. This echoes what we've seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut : Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed. New York : Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side. It's clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.

Probably no later that 2:30pm. From: Michelle Raimo KouyateSent: Tuesday, November 4, 2014 7:02 AMTo: Minghella, HannahCc: Pascal, AmySubject: Re: Hotel TThanks Hannah. I agree with most of this. Especially with the idea that the first act is sorely in need of streamlining and needs to be focused around the central idea of what is at stake for Drac should Dennis be a human. The impetus for this meeting was to mainly discuss the idea aging up Dennis based on the new research so I suggest a good strategy may be to discuss some of these in that context. Particularly in light of that we just asked them to put in more pre-pregnancy Mavis based on prior thoughts and the research from last year that indicated how important she is (and that research was international and not just domestic like the recent one).Sent from my iPadOn Nov 3, 2014, at 11:22 PM, \"Minghella, Hannah\" wrote: Just watched the revised animatic and wanted to share some thoughts...Mavis's \"issue\" of wondering if getting married will limit her opportunities in life is at odds with her issue the rest of the movie. I think it's misleading. In fact, all of the business before the wedding feels superfluous. The news of the wedding isn't the conflict in the movie. What if we open on the montage of Mavis and Johnny's wedding but make it into an opening titles sequence. Make it really fun and a bigger production\/musical number. Better if the first announcement of the movie is \"I'm pregnant\" and Mavis' heart to heart with him is about the pregnancy\/baby rather than getting married. Also I think it would be better if Mavis' question - \"you don't mind that he's humany\" and Drac's response \"monster, humany, unicorn\" was about the baby instead of Johnny. It's not totally clear whether Drac is preoccupied with Dennis being a vampire from the moment he's born or only once Johnny's parents suggest Mavis and Johnny should move to live with them? Is his issue that he wants a grandson who is a monster or that he's afraid of the consequences to his family if he isn't? Why is it good for Johnny to be in on Drac's plan to take Dennis away? Maybe it would be better if Drac hatches the plan with Frank since the monsters then help sell the idea to Mavis in the next scene anyway. Not sure we want to emphasize that Mavis and Johnny have lost their zing. Too many ideas. There's also an odd negative commentary on marriage that Mavis thinks she won't get to pursue her dreams if she gets married and then within a few years of having a baby their marriage has lost its zing. The beats of Drac and the monsters demonstrating their monster skills isn't funny enough yet. After each monster fails to be scary there has to be a bigger joke to button those beats otherwise they feel somewhat anticlimactic. It should be Drac, not Frank, who says at the end of Act 2 that they need to go see Vlad. After resisting for the whole of the second act we need to understand how desperate he is to decide to go to this extreme. ----boundary-LibPST-iamunique-1369549809_-_---","label":0}

IPCC won't be discussing this in Beijing in May - except as part of Chapter 6. Hans von Storch will likely regret some of the words he's said. FYI, just as NCAR have put up a web site to give the whole story re Chris Landseas's 'resignation' from a CA in the atmos. obs. chapter (to help Kevin Trenberth out), KNMI are doing the same re Rob van Dorland and that Dutch magazine. The chief scientist at KNMI has got involved as Rob didn't say the things attributed to him. I'll find out more on this in Pune as a guy from KNMI will be there. Several other CAs on our chapter pulled out, or just didn't do anything. Their stories never got run. Dick's report was good and my bit in Nature cam across well.

{"text":"Hi Eystein and Jonathan, With respect to the question of a separate paleo-climate chapter: if paleoclimate is an adjunct to all of the other chapters, what would happen - would there be a paleo-climate person on each of those chapters, just for that component? If so, the person would not carry much influence - and if chapters had to be trimmed (which we know always happens), there's a chance that a lot of the paleoclimate aspect would be the first to go. I'm afraid that little in-depth discussion would survive. On the other hand: now that there's been a paleoclimate chapter, a lot of the 'introductory' material would not really be needed - just the 'updates', which make for much fewer pages. Perhaps, then, paleoclimate observations could be part of the climate observation chapter; and paleoclimate modeling, part of the modeling chapter. That way, at least several people with paleoclimate heritage could be part of each of these chapters, and allow for a proper representation of the state of our understanding in these areas. It would also allow for better integration of paleoclimates with the current climate. As in the case of present climate, care would have to be taken to ensure that the observations and modeling chapters have strong linkages. Concerning what new topic should be addressed: there should be a discussion about the use of paleoclimates as analogs for the future. Some scientists (including at least one at GISS) are certain of their utility in this regard. I think the topic should be addressed from all sides. And as for 'new' paleoclimate work: we have an article about to come out in GRL on stratospheric ozone during the LGM; here's the link: [1]#id2009GL037617 David -- \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ References 1. #id2009GL037617","label":0}

{"text":"FW: SONY\/ Mark E. Pollack Settlement Proposal Leah and Bob: After Bob sent to Pollack the revised proposal set forth below, I received a call late this afternoon from Ben Singer, one of Pollack's attorneys. The response was not good. Ben made the following points: 1. The holdback of 50% is ridiculously too high. They would want 85% upon signing of a short form. (I told him that if so, the short form would not be so short). 2. They will never agree to a time limit on the agreement \u2013 the deal with Mark would not end until the IGT deal finally ends. THIS IS THE BIG ONE. 3. On 6A(1), they want 20% until December 31, 2029. (I think that if SPT agreed to no termination date, they would agree to 20% until December 31, 2024). 4. On 6A(2), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally ends. 5. On 6A(3), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally ends. 6. 6A(4) would be deleted. 7. On 6B, they want to be sure that the indemnity provisions survive, that Pollack retains audit rights and the right to secure copies of records relevant to conducting an audit. They are confused as to 6B(3), and would want to discuss the length of such an agreement and what provisions would survive. If SPT\/SPCP is free to use Pollack or not, they do not understand why any end date is needed. So, in the event SPT accepted such a deal, what would SPT have achieved? 1. Paid 7 of the 14 million as a compromise. 2. When the 2024 deal ends, reduce Pollack's deal on gambling monies to 10%. 3. Reduce non-gambling monies to 10% now and going forward. 4. Limit the deal to WOF and Jeopardy! and no other properties. 5. Pollack to consult only upon SPT request \u2013 non audit related records not sent to Pollack. Confidentiality obligation imposed. I have asked our outside counsel to revisit the issue of whether SPT can legally terminate the deal at the end of 2024 and to revert to me this weekend. I want to better understand our chances \u2013 although any decision would be by an arbitrator, not in court.

{"text":"Dr. Solomon, It is not clear what makes the Wegman Committee Report in your opinion a \"new low\". In scientific study, one part is clearly physical (growth rates of trees, IR absorption, etc.) and a separate part is the statistical treatment of the data. Dr. Wegman's report is clearly focused on the latter. He is well qualified to analyze statistical methods, as chair of the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, and a board member of the American Statistical Association. The conclusion of the Committee headed by Dr. Wegman is clear - the statistical methods of MBH 98\/99 cannot be relied upon to support the claim that the 90's were the hottest decade of the past millennium. If one wants to argue with Dr. Wegman's conclusion, it will be necessary to show how he has misunderstood or misrepresented the statistical methods used in those studies. Obviously this does not prove that the 90's were not the hottest decade of the past millennium, only that the MBH 98\/99 analyses cannot be used to support that claim, nothing more and nothing less. Anyone interested in paleoclimatology in general, and dendrochronology in particular, should read the recent NAS report and the Wegman Committee Report (or in fact anyone interested in the use of statistics in climatology). Your last comment seems to reflect a belief that it is scurrilous to \"question unquestioned science\". Wouldn't there seem to be a long honored history of exactly this type of action, both before and after Einstein? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting your remarks.

The report contradicts a recent National Academy of Sciences study that found the hockey stick analysis -- which concluded Earth has been warmer over the last millennium than at any other point -- is largely correct. Published in 1998 by the journal Nature, the hockey stick reconstructs past global average temperatures using data from corals, tree rings, ice cores and bore holes deep within the Earth -- the first to draw on multiple sources of \"proxy data\" to sketch a picture of past climate. The study includes a graph that shows Earth's average temperature increasing sharply during the 20th century, with an upward curve that resembles the blade of a hockey stick. Often cited as evidence that human emissions are the dominant cause of rising global temperatures, the graph became controversial after it appeared in a 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. But the House Committee's ad hoc panel says the hockey stick's authors relied on statistics that are pre-disposed to produce the hockey-stick shape. Claims by the hockey stick paper's authors of unprecedented global warming during the 20th century \"cannot be supported by [the] analysis,\" the panel concluded. The Energy and Commerce Committee -- whose chairman, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), is a leading Capitol Hill critic of the hockey-stick study -- has scheduled a hearing next week on the ad hoc panel's conclusions. In June 2005, Barton and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.) launched a probe into scientific and financial records of climatologists who created the graph -- Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, Raymond Bradley of the University of Massachusetts and Malcolm Hughes of the University of Arizona (Greenwire, July 18, 2005). That prompted a rare show of public infighting between Barton and Whitfield and House Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert (R-N.Y.), who asked the National Academy of Sciences to examine the validity of the hockey stick and similar climate reconstructions (Greenwire, June 23).

{"text":"Dear White Nationalist: You are no doubt sickened by the on-going destruction of our White heritage. Japan will always be Japanese, China always Chinese, India always Indian, Africa always Black, etc. but there is no White nation in the Western world today that will remain White. Even Sweden is now \u00b3multicultural,\u00b2 and this destruction is thought \u00b3progressive\u00b2 by our liberal elites. Regardless of what we think of Christianity, multiculturalism got under way with breakdown of religion in the West. Coincidence? Not at all if we think of religion as social ideology. Society needs ideology. It gives a sense of community and collectivism, and suppresses individual self-indulgence. Without social ideology we are all individuals, and what is liberalism except exalting of the individual that makes him\/her prey to all manner and sort of freedom mongering? That is the state of White society today. It is atomized and rotting. No wonder that the White race is on the road to extinction. The answer, then, lies in religion. Not the Christian religion, to be sure, but one more enlightened on the Universe and Nature that will not break down under the intense glare of reason. Such a religion is LOGOS Pantheism, which you can learn about by visiting its website: \u00be But do not expect a racist rant. To be viable a movement must outreach into the general White mainstream, which no racist approach can do. Instead, the intention with this religion is to grow into congregations, not a party or political \u0152movement,\u00b9 formed by sifting the masses for Whites attracted to it. The current White masses are a write-off but we can and must salvage groups, which can again grow into a new White nation. The best of White stock will thereby be preserved with a religious ideology for survival, and those congregations can later separate from our decadent and hostile West into a new Nation. This is a religion with a strategy. I have contacted you because you are a leader in the White nationalist cause. Religions in the past have spread by social contact, requiring centuries. LOGOS Pantheism is a religion for White survival. If it requires centuries to spread, the White race deprived of belief could become extinct. The modern era, however, is unlike past eras due to the Internet, and White interests are facilitated by the already existing White nationalist network that is worldwide. If you are one touched by this religion after reading its website, if you are truly interested in White survival and see the need for an outreach program, and especially if you are convinced of the futility of other approaches, LOGOS Pantheism is a religion you will want to consider. Yours truly, Wayne Macleod","label":0}

In Pennsylvania, exit polling showed that 71 percent of Democratic voters felt their primary had energized the party while 58 percent of Republican voters said their primary had divided the party \u2013 nearly the same in both cases as what New Yorkers reported last week. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on tonight's results: \"Ranting and raving his way to five primary victories tonight, Donald Trump has secured his chokehold on the Republican nomination. For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain. They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump's impending nomination is the ultimate, sad success of that strategy. Trump is the modern Republican Party. \"It's no surprise that at exit polls in contest after contest, more and more Democratic voters are reporting that our primary process has energized our party, while more and more Republicans report deep, dispiriting divisions in theirs. \"I want to congratulate Secretary Clinton on her victories tonight, and both of our candidates for continuing to run spirited, substantive campaigns worthy of the American people.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background than others. In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed. unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that), it doesn't need a different background as well. I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of horizontal, and see what turns up. | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined | in app-defaults-color or ~\/exmh\/exmh-defaults-color. OK. | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet. In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about. A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it displays is a secondary consideration. But as a suggestion, have an \"all unknown\" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black) | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background? | | I don't see any reason why not. Experiment and let me know what works for you. Done some of that. First, the most significant change came from changing relief from raised to sunken. I don't know why, but it just looks better (for me anyway). But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a bit too similar. I ended up using *sequence_cur: -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2 The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using had spaces in their names. PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which is probably safer for generic use. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com","label":0}

{"text":"[ GOP DAILY ROUNDUP 5\/3\/16 DONALD TRUMP TED CRUZ EVENTS DONALD TRUMP TRUMP SUGGESTS RAFAEL CRUZ HELPED ASSASSINATE JFK: \"Donald Trump on Tuesday alleged that Ted Cruz's father was with John F. Kennedy's assassin shortly before he murdered the president, parroting a National Enquirer story claiming that Rafael Cruz was pictured with Lee Harvey Oswald handing out pro-Fidel Castro pamphlets in New Orleans in 1963\u2026'His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being - you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous,' Trump said Tuesday during a phone interview with Fox News. 'What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. They don't even talk about that. That was reported, and nobody talks about it.' 'I mean, what was he doing - what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting?' Trump continued. 'It's horrible.'\" [Politico, 5\/3\/16 ] TRUMP RESPONDS TO \"MOST RECENT OUTBURST FROM TED CRUZ\": \"Ted Cruz is a desperate candidate trying to save his failing campaign. It is no surprise he has resorted to his usual tactics of over-the-top rhetoric that nobody believes. Over the last week, I have watched Lyin' Ted become more and more unhinged as he is unable to react under the pressure and stress of losing, in all cases by landslides, the last six primary elections --- in fact, coming in last place in all but one of them. Today's ridiculous outburst only proves what I have been saying for a long time, that Ted Cruz does not have the temperament to be President of the United States.\" [Donald J. Trump for President, Statement, 5\/3\/16 ] TRUMP SAYS HE WOULD \"PROHIBIT\" MILITARY LEADERS FROM TALKING TO PRESS: \"If he becomes commander in chief, Donald Trump won't let military generals speak to \"the dishonest press,\" out of fear they'll spill national security secrets. 'A general should not be on television,' the Republican front-runner told a crowd of supporters during a rally at Carmel, Indiana, on Monday. 'I don't want our generals on television. I will prohibit them.'\" [Military Times, 5\/3\/16 ] EXPERTS WARN OF BACKLASH OVER TRUMP'S CHINA TRADE POLICIES: \"Starting a trade war might be cathartic for workers who have lost jobs, but it is unlikely to create a lot of factory work. 'There's no way a tariff of this kind could deliver the kind of benefits that he's talking about, and it's quite wrong to think that the big problem for American workers has been foreign trade,' said J .W. Mason, a professor of economics at John Jay College and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. 'But I think it could be very destructive for the rest of the world.'\" [New York Times, 5\/3\/16 ] TRUMP FALSELY SAYS HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MIKE TYSON'S RAPE TRIAL: \"'Do you still think Mike Tyson got a raw deal when he endorsed you?' Trump was asked. 'I don't know anything about it. I know he endorsed me. I heard he endorsed me,' Trump stated. 'I don't know anything about his trial. I really don't.' Trump, a longtime friend of Tyson, opined at length about the trial on television, in newspapers, and in magazines. Trump has claimed Tyson was 'railroaded' in the case and on several occasions offered criticism of Tyson's defense attorney. Trump said in 1992 that Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving time in prison. Trump also called into question whether the victim had been raped at all.\" [Buzzfeed, 5\/2\/16 ] TRUMP NOW PAYS TWITTER TO PROMOTE HIS TWEETS: \"Mr. Trump's campaign has joined Twitter's regional ad targeting, having four of his posts appear in the feeds of selected Twitter users in Indiana, regardless of whether they are followers of the candidate. In a sign of growing technical sophistication within the Trump campaign, the Twitter posts are being aimed at particular audiences within the state. For example, a post with a video featuring the endorsement of Bobby Knight, theformer Indiana University basketball coach, was targeted at basketball fans as identified by Twitter.\" [New York Times, 5\/3\/16 ] BACK TO TOP \u2191 TED CRUZ CRUZ AIDE SAYS CAMPAIGN IS BRACING FOR IMMEDIATE STAFF CUTS AND \"A VERY SOMBER\" SPEECH TUESDAY NIGHT: \"Cruz has spent the past week camped out in Indiana, securing the support of the state's governor and announcing retired technology executive Carly Fiorina as his running mate. Yet his aides were pessimistic heading into Tuesday's voting and were prepared for Cruz to fall short. With polls predicting a loss, campaign officials were bracing for immediate staffing cuts 'at a minimum,' according to one aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions. The aide said the campaign was preparing for 'a very somber' address Tuesday night in Indianapolis.\" [AP, 5\/3\/16 ] CRUZ MOCKS TRUMP'S \"BATTLES WITH VENEREAL DISEASE\": \"Cruz continued: 'The man cannot tell the truth, but he combines with it being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, \"Dude, what's your problem?\"'\u2026'Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it,' Cruz told reporters, referring to remarks Trump made to radio personality Howard Stern in 1997. 'This is not a secret. He's proud of being a serial philanderer. I want everyone to think about your teenage kids. The president of the United States talks about how great it is to commit adultery, how proud he is, describes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam.'\" [Texas Tribune, 5\/3\/16 ] BACK TO TOP \u2191 EVENTS TUESDAY, MAY 3, 2016 DONALD TRUMP: Election Night Event Trump Tower in New York, NY [@katieglueck].

{"text":"Hi everyone. I have yet another request for which I need your input. Causey is reviewing his budgets\/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s). What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey. For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting\/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments. It should NOT include any settlements\/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world). I say \"department\" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc. If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss. The data needs to be as recent as possible. Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31\/August 1. If you have more recent data, that would be great. At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.) It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request. Additionally, if you can provide me with a \"current estimate\" for the groups you report, that would be ideal. I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group\/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE. The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both. If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss. Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon. This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions. If you have any questions, please give me a call.

I feel like he'll say it no matter what, but obviously if he says that on a press call, it's going to be bad for us, especially with this week we've had. From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Friday, May 20, 2016 9:40 AM To: RR2 Subject: Research: pls fact check Dan Gross remarks for 11:15AM Just got these from Brady Campaign. Thanks Thank you Congresswoman Esty and Congressman Aguilar. Both of you are glowing examples of what it means to be a leader and to truly serve the American people, and I'm privileged that I can call you allies of ours in the fight to keep guns out of dangerous hands. Unfortunately in our Congress today there are some politicians too beholden to the corporate gun lobby. They kowtow to the industry's giants and keep violent felons, domestic abusers, and even terrorists armed to the teeth with guns. Earlier this week Senator Chuck Schumer fulfilled a personal promise he made to the Brady Campaign by introducing Brady Bill 2.0. This bill would expand Brady background checks to all gun sales, a policy supported by 90 percent of Americans, including 84 percent of gun owners and, yes, 74 percent of National Rifle Association members. I'll say that again, 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, violent felons, and people with dangerous mental illnesses. There's remarkable common ground shared by the American people. It doesn't matter whether you love or hate guns, nine out of ten Americans believe we would all be safer if there weren't thousands of guns sold every day, at gun shows and online, without background checks. But the NRA's leadership and political champions, including Wayne LaPierre, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Donald J. Trump, have flouted the will of everyday NRA members to appease the gun industry. As the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump has made gun violence in America a campaign trail punchline. In January, the front runner speculated that he could \"stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody\" without hurting his popularity. He has opposed expanded background checks despite the fact that they are supported by nearly three-quarters of the very same membership of the organization he'll address today. It's interesting to me that Trump, who has branded himself as a populist candidate not beholden to any lobby or special interest group, continuously regurgitates the baseless talking points used by the corporate gun lobby and its allies in Congress. Make no mistake: this presidential election represents a critical crossroads for this issue and for our collective safety. Lives are literally at stake. The choice between Hillary Clinton Democrats and Donald Trump will be a referendum on gun violence in America - and the result will make a big difference either helping to fight or fuel the problem. Americans agree we can't afford a President who will put lives at risk by rolling back effective, life-saving gun safety measures and advocating for a world where everyone - from convicted violent criminals to domestic abusers to terrorists - can buy guns with no questions asked. As he prepares to address the National Rifle Association as today's keynote speaker, I challenge Donald Trump to stand by the 74% of NRA members who want expanded Brady background checks and I call on him to support Senator Schumer's recently introduced Brady Bill 2.0 that expands background checks to all gun sales.

She is among the women featured in the controversial New York Times story about Trump's dealings with women. She also believes the GOP frontrunner bullied her \"all the time.\" \"For sure he is not a good person,\" Machado told Inside Edition. In 1996, Trump had just taken over the Miss Universe pageant. His then wife, Marla Maples, was one of the hosts on the night Machado won the tiara. But within a few months, she gained weight and rumors swirled that she could lose her crown. Trump finally insisted she lost weight, calling her \"an eating machine\" on Howard Stern's radio show and took her to work out in a gym packed with media. \"She weighed 118 pounds or 117 pounds and she went to 160 or 170. So this is somebody that likes to eat,\" he said at the time. Machado, who claims she gained closer to 15 pounds, says she felt publicly shamed and he called her \"Miss Piggy.\" She said it made her feel \"so fat\" that it made her \"very depressed.\" At the time Trump took Machado to the gym, he was asked by a reporter \"What happens if Marla gains this kind of weight? Would you drop her?\" \"Well, I'd probably do the same thing with her,\" he said. \"I'd say 'start working out.' No, I wouldn't. Still a very interesting question.\" Machado went on to become a big star of telenovelas. She was also the first Miss Universe to pose for Playboy magazine in 2006. The 39-year-old says her experience with Trump led to years of battling eating disorders and psychotherapy. She is about to become an American citizen - just in time to vote in the presidential election . When asked if she would vote for Trump , she laughed.","label":0}

This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori! One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down in price. Hearing that the only \"officially\" functional Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit? At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's XPlay remains a better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player. Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's SIC without a hitch. I just missed a face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of winferno.com, although I'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the free copy of Research-Desk for all Gnomedex attendees.

All CDs are professionally mastered works, so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

GnomeDVD Click for Details Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (NR) 1966 Adapted Play - 131min Reviewer's Tilt (10) Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president. At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange. Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step. Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing. At one point George proposes \"Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?\" This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a \"feel good\" movie. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

[SigDems] Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 - MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC From: Wei, Shu-Yen Sent: Wednesday, May 04, 2016 11:41 AM To: Paustenbach, Mark; Miranda, Luis; Walker, Eric; Walsh, Tom Subject: RE: For Comms Approval: Talking points for NJ teacher press call Still working on getting a third speaker, updated NJ teachers script, plus a third set below (I'm really trying to get a woman as the third person) Assemblyman Diegnan Hi everyone and thank you for joining the call. This is Assemblyman Pat Diegnan, and I serve as the Chair of the Education Committee. It has certainly been a busy week in Trenton and nationally as well, with Donald Trump spouting another conspiracy theory and all but certain to secure the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz dropping out, and our governor generating buzz as a possible Trump vice presidential pick. During this Teacher Appreciation Week, we wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the Republican record on education locally and at the national level. Governor Christie's behavior toward teachers and public employees for the past six years has been disgraceful. Over and over again, he has tried to devalue the teaching profession and squeeze those who work so hard to shape our children's future. He actually suggested last year that teachers should be making minimum wage , after he vetoed and stood against minimum wage increases. And he is supporting and actively campaigning for Donald Trump, who is similarly destructive. Trump has said that he would reduce union power and has vowed to cut the Department of Education. How is that for investing in New Jersey's future? And our state has resoundingly rejected these wrong-headed policies, Governor Christie's approval ratings have plummeted to 26 percent since he endorsed Trump. These issues haven't gotten much attention because of the GOP's numerous, other outrageous comments. The Republican party agenda is so extreme that those backward education proposals are the standard now. As New Jersey has wrestled with the consequences of Governor Christie's actions and hostility, we cannot allow his policies to spread across the country at the prospect of a Republican president. Now, I would like to introduce someone who has always been a champion of educators, NJEA President Wendell Steinhauer. Wendell Steinhauer Hi everyone, and thank you Assemblyman. As some of you may know, I taught in the Riverside public schools for 27 years. In my time at the NJEA, I've seen first-hand Chris Christie at work. This week is Teacher Appreciation Week, and Governor Christie has been anything but appreciative of teachers and our work his entire tenure in office. We all remember when he slashed the state education aid by more than $1 billion in his first year in office, leading to thousands of layoffs. Or when he made reneged on his promise to fund public employee pensions, despite his promise to do so at the negotiation table. Or when he suggested violence against teachers and teachers unions; he has made multiple references to punching us. It is certainly no surprise to us that Chris Christie is supporting Donald Trump for President, they are two peas in pod. But when it comes to teachers, we cannot allow what Governor Christie has done to New Jersey to spread to the rest of the country, especially now that Trump is the standard bearer of the Republican party. Trump is on record for saying that he would cut the Department of Education and that he would reduce the power of the teachers' unions. We simply can't imagine what would happen under this Republican president, where Governor Christie's dangerous ideas and policies would surely be allowed to spread nationally. We are calling out these dangerous ideas and gross misconceptions and asking voters to take a stand against them. Thank you. I would like to now turn it over to [3rd speaker] Speaker #3 Thank you XXXX, and as mentioned, I am XXXX. Before Donald Trump was even thinking about running for President, Chris Christie was writing the book on squeezing teachers and hurting working families here in New Jersey. Just this week, he vetoed an equal pay bill that would have helped women breadwinners in our state. I couldn't believe it he suggested that teachers should be making minimum wage last year. And let's face it, the teaching profession is a woman-dominated one and issues around equal pay and the minimum wage affect working women and their families. So when Governor Christie says those horrible things about teachers and suggests inflicting violence on teachers' unions, he is targeting a lot of New Jersey women. At the national level, Trump and the rest of the Republican Party share those values. With Trump as the face of the Republican party, we expect to hear a lot more divisive, wrong-headed rhetoric, and unfortunately, more hostility toward educators. Trump and Christie are cut from the same cloth. New Jersey is well aware of Christie's bullying tactics, reneging on promises made at the negotiation table, slashing funding for state education. And all indicators suggest that Trump will be worse on the national level. Thank you.","label":0}

{"text":"In Indiana, Cruz Mocks Trump's \"Battles with Venereal Disease\" by Patrick Svitek Bracing for a devastating loss in Indiana's primary, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is throwing the kitchen sink at frontrunner Donald Trump. Hours before the polls close Tuesday in the Hoosier State, Cruz promised to tell reporters at a stop in Evansville \"what I really think of Donald Trump\" - before unloading on the billionaire as a \"pathological liar,\" \"utterly amoral\" and a \"serial philanderer.\" \"He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies,\" Cruz said in remarks that were broadcast live on national TV. \"He lies - practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\" Cruz continued: \"The man cannot tell the truth, but he combines with it being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, 'Dude, what's your problem?'\" Cruz did not let up, going on to call Trump \"utterly amoral\" while making reference to the billionaire's attacks on Cruz's wife. \"Morality does not exist for him,\" Cruz said of Trump. \"Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it,\" Cruz told reporters, referring to remarks Trump made to radio personality Howard Stern in 1997. \"This is not a secret. He's proud of being a serial philanderer. I want everyone to think about your teenage kids. The president of the United States talks about how great it is to commit adultery, how proud he is, describes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam.\" Cruz's remarks came the same morning that Trump, in a TV interview, invoked a tabloid report that tied Cruz's dad Rafael to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. Cruz has previously denied the story. On Tuesday, he mocked Trump's allegation. \"Let's be clear: This is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is kooky,\" Cruz said in Evansville. \"While I'm at it, I should go ahead and admit yes, my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard.\"","label":0}

{"text":"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, May 4, 2016 Contact: Rebecca Bryant, 202-225-8901 Smith Statement on Republican NDAA Provision Attacking LGBT Rights Washington D.C. - Congressman Adam Smith released the following statement about the Russell amendment attacking LGBT rights that was included in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. During mark-up of the NDAA in committee, Democrats fought against efforts to expand religious organizations' ability to conduct 'taxpayer funded discrimination' against LGBT individuals, women, and other groups. \"The language in the Russell amendment is a direct attack on LGBT rights. The president issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or identity by government contractors. The Russell amendment tries to override this executive order by artfully claiming to protect 'religious freedom,' but just like similar efforts in numerous state legislatures, this is actually an effort to promote discrimination. The language tries to protect the so-called 'right' to get government contracts and grants and still discriminate against people whose lifestyle you don't approve of. Government-funded discrimination is wrong under any circumstances, and we certainly shouldn't be trying to expand it in a defense policy bill.\" ### Rebecca Bryant Communications Director Congressman Adam Smith (WA-09) Office: 202.225.8901 | Cell: 202.308.2181 2264 Rayburn House Office Building Twitter: @RepAdamSmith Facebook: Rep.

{"text":"David, Peter, Ian, Let's go for the week with Feb 25\/26 in it. I could come down for late on the 25th then spend most of the 26th discussing Ian's work and also the Antarctic ideas. Presumably John Prior and others will be available at some point on the 26th. The Antarctic surface T data that are in CRUTEM3 have come from my searches over the years and also from READER. Much of the early stuff in READER has come from the archives here, except where BAS have got the original digitized data from the Antarctic Institutes in all the countries. I also have some files of when some of the manned stations on the ice have moved. These are forced moves, as the station moves, but they have never been accounted for. Halley and Casey are affected. There are issues to discuss about the AWSs and also, as David knows from AOPC, work that Wisconsin are doing in putting together all the historic US series. I've talked to them about this - mainly to try and stop them calculating mean T a different way. If they do this it will screw their series up. It all relates to them saying that the mean of min and max is not a great way in the Antarctic to calculate mean T. They say they can now do the mean of every 3 hours, but it needs the historic series and the routine updating to change at the same time - which is unlikely to happen. Cheers Phil At 18:13 09\/02\/2009, David Parker wrote: Phil Thanks. I think Feb 25-26 is better as Peter, who suggested the Reader- data project, will be away in the first week of March. Ian will be here except, I think, on Feb 27th when he is going to a chess tournament.

{"text":"Daily Message Points May 20, 2016 Zika * Today, the President and Vice President received a briefing on the ongoing response to the Zika virus from members of his public health team including Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Director of NIH\/NIAID Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Tom Frieden. * Following the meeting, the President highlighted the facts about this disease and the ways it spreads and underscored that as summer approaches we need to step up our efforts to protect Americans, something the President has long called for. * Three months ago, he asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat Zika. $1.9 billion isn't an arbitrary number. It's what public health experts consider necessary to fund things like mosquito control, tracking the spread of the virus, accelerating new vaccines to market, and monitoring women and babies with the virus. * The Republican Senate has only approved about half of that money. The Republican House has approved no new money, instead taking money from the funding we need to keep fighting Ebola - and that money will run out in September. * As the President made clear, we cannot partially fight this disease - and Republicans in the House and Senate need to do their jobs. They need to get a bill to the President's desk. * Every day Congress waits will have consequences. Slower, less accurate diagnostic tests. Delayed vaccines. Weaker mosquito control efforts. It puts the American people at risk. * The American people should expect their representatives to do their jobs, and give our experts the resources they need to fight this disease and keep us safe. The President's Foreign Travel * The President's trip to Vietnam and Japan - his 10th trip to Asia as President - provides a historic opportunity to further the progress in U.S.-Vietnam relations and is another step forward in the President's Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific. * In Vietnam, the President will focus on advancing our economic cooperation and trade.

{"text":"Per our convo this morning Buzzfeed: Donald Trump In 1992: Tyson Told Me Victim In Rape Case \"Wanted It Real Bad\" \"She knocked on his door at 1 a.m. and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\" posted on Apr. 30, 2016, at 3:03 p.m. Donald Trump's rivals Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina have hammered the frontrunner this week for touting the endorsement of former heavyweight-boxing champion Mike Tyson in Indiana \u2014 a state where Tyson was convicted in 1992 of raping a beauty pageant contestant Desiree Washington. Trump controversially suggested in 1992 Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving a jail sentence and as reported earlier this week by BuzzFeed News said in the early '90s that Tyson was \"railroaded\" in his case, and that the victim had willingly entered Tyson's room. In another instance in late 1992, Trump discussed the case at length in an interview with Charlie Rose. The topic centered around a New York magazine profile in which Trump said his mother was angry at him for defending Tyson. In the piece, Trump said Tyson told him the victim \"wanted it real bad.\" Wrote New York magazine in their cover profile of Trump: Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who put him in jail \"wanted it real bad.\" Trump feels Tyson is doing time on a bad rap: \"She knocked on his door at 1 a.m. and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\" This speech is another of the set pieces he is so fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years. Trump said his mother was not amused with his defense of Tyson. \"I think that's probably the first time that my mother absolutely got angry at me,\" Trump told Rose. \"I really mean that. My mother was so crazy when I came out in defense of Mike Tyson.\" Again remarking that his mother was livid at him, Trump added that he had problems with how Tyson's defense was handled. \"She didn't exactly like the fact that I was defending Iron Mike, but I watched what happened to Mike Tyson,\" said Trump. \"I watched how badly he was represented by an attorney in Washington that was charging him $3, $4, or $5 million against a local attorney, the best within 100 miles, that the state hired who just ate the other man's lunch. I watched the way he did it.\" Trump then questioned if the rape even had occurred, suggesting the victim made it up. \"I heard about a girl that late in the evening knocked on his door, was taken in, was raped perhaps, perhaps not,\" said Trump. \"I don't know. Again, I think he was badly represented, but I did see that number one, she knocks late in the night. Number two, she's dancing in a beauty contest at 8 a.m. I saw the tapes. I see the big smile on her face. She's dancing happily at 8 a.m. Then Mike Tyson's in jail for four, five, or six years. I had a real problem with that case. I had a real problem with Mike Tyson's lawyers. I had a real problem with Don King. I just think that he was really fed out to the wolves.\" Trump noted Tyson still denied the charges and said he believed if Tyson hadn't testified would have been found not guilty. \"He to this day denies it,\" said Trump, when asked by Rose if Tyson should have gone to jail if found guilty. \"I don't know that it happened. I think that as they said if he didn't testify, he would have been exonerated totally. The jury said that. Mike was arrogant. He was a horrible witness from what I understand. I'm not surprised. I would say that generally speaking, you don't put Mike on as a witness but he was a horrible witness. To get four, five, or six years, I think that there was just too many circumstances. Again, she was in a beauty contest. She was dancing with a big smile on her face at 8:00 a.m.\" Trump said Tyson was thrown in jail before being found guilty and deserved another chance. \"I watched Mike,\" he staid. \"I've been with Mike. I've seen him. People really take advantage of this man. I want to tell you something. I think this is one of those examples. Now, I know we have a system of juries. We have a system where if you're found guilty, you're guilty, but somebody like me and maybe who has a little bit more independent streak can say, 'Hey, Mike Tyson in my opinion should really be given another break.' They put him in jail before he was even guilty as far as I was concerned.\" Eric Walker walkere@dnc.org 732-991-1489 @ericmwalker","label":0}
{"text":"The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group. We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter. This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000. When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months. This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group. In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. Crude and Products group Mid-marketing Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group. Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well. The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services. This group reports to Randy Maffett. Origination In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope. Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan. Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide. The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets. Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. Trading Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South. The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland. Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas. Shipping Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products. Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line. Weather The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world. Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe. Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities. Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul. Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America. Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization. The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities. In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions. We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline. Coal Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S. Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia. Enron Japan The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan. The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities. Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization. Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM. All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities. LNG LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world. Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities. Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant, Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region. Enron Freight Markets EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months. Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks. Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products. Global Risk Markets David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup. Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance. In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk. Financial Trading Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.

From: Jefferson, Deshundra Sent: Thursday, May 19, 2016 5:02 PM To: Helmstetter, TJ Subject: Scripts for the NRA Call Importance: High What is the speaking order? I would like to create a briefing report like I did for my rights restoration call last week; a copy is attached. Rep. Pete Aguilar Thank you for joining this call today. This issue is very personal to me given that San Bernardino, California is a part of my district. I left the House floor after the first votes that after the December 2, 2015, shooting to return to the district. No one ever thinks something like that will happen so close to home. Yet it did. We have held so many moments of silence for those lost to gun violence. We have prayed for their families, and we have vowed to take steps so that this would never happen again. Our words are empty if our actions don't back them up. No single reform could have stopped the tragedy that unfolded in San Bernardino, but that's not an excuse to ignore the need for a national discussion around gun safety. The National Rifle Association is the most powerful gun lobby in the nation, and they have tried to shut down any attempts at sensible gun safety measures, even though a majority of their members think it's time to have reforms like universal background checks for all gun purchases. Despite the recent spate of mass shootings and terror fears, the NRA and their Republican friends in Congress even opposed a measure to bar suspected terrorists from buying guns. Not too long ago, Donald Trump criticized Republican officials who \"walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.\" Today, he's singing the praises of the Second Amendment as \"a bedrock natural right.\" Trump's also pushed the real estate industry, as a group, to hire NRA lobbyists even though he claimed many of the NRA's positions were indefensible. I don't know how officials at the NRA or the Republican Party sleep at night, knowing that we can and should do more to protect our communities. There's an emptiness to our unanswered prayers for change when we don't take steps to work for the type of change that we want. I don't want to hold another moment of silence - I want Congress to toward a sensible solution and I want the Republican Party to realize that they answer to the American public, not the NRA. Rep. Elizabeth Esty Hi everyone, thank you for joining us on the call and thank you to the other speakers for your attention to this issue. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut is in my district. I am sickened and horrified that in the three-and-a-half years since those shootings, nothing has been done on gun reform. I lay the blame on the NRA and the Members of Congress who are beholden to them. Despite the fact that 90 percent of Americans supported action on gun reform after Newtown tragedy, the NRA and their allies worked to defeat the bill by spreading rumors and falsehoods. Meanwhile, news of shootings across the country dominate the headlines. Both of our Democratic presidential candidates have proposed solutions to address this crisis, and President Obama's executive actions earlier this year addresses this crisis with expanding background checks, better enforcing laws already on the books, increasing mental health treatment, and funding research for gun safety technology. Meanwhile the NRA is advocating for further deregulation of firearms, and they have found a willing audience in the Republican Party. We've seen this play out over and over again over the years. With the help of the Republican Party, the NRA defeated a bill to extend a ban on assault weapons, blocked a bill that would have extended background checks to guns shows, and passed dangerous \"stand your ground\" laws in 23 states, including Kentucky. The NRA and their legislative allies are making our country less safe. It is unconscionable that Donald Trump and top Republican leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell continue to indulge this radical organization. The NRA and its extreme, uncompromising leadership have blocked reasonable reforms to reduce gun violence. As a vice chair of the U.S. House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I am a strong advocate for commonsense gun reforms in Congress. We cannot allow the NRA to control the White House come November, and we need to block their influence in Congress. I am urging the media on this call and voters to hold these people accountable. We can't cross our fingers and hope against hope for an end to gun violence. We need to make it happen.

{"text":"Sent from my iPhone Begin forwarded message: From: Nicky Vogt > Date: May 16, 2016 at 2:34:20 PM EDT To: Nicky Vogt > Subject: Will New Round of Immigration Raids Dampen Latino Political Enthusiasm in 2016? For Immediate Release: Contact: Michael Earls at 202-494-8555 and press@americasvoice.org May 16, 2016 Will New Round of Immigration Raids Dampen Latino Political Enthusiasm in 2016? Washington, DC \u2013 After news broke last week that the Obama Administration was planning a new round of immigration raids targeting young mothers and unaccompanied children from Central America, leading Democratic voices and policy experts and advocates condemned the planned enforcement actions as morally wrong and misguided on policy. Additionally, as leading observers are beginning to highlight, the planned raids also have a potentially damaging political effect. Writing at Daily Kos last week, Kerry Eleveld had a must-read piece outlining the electoral arguments for why potential Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, \"should quit courting GOP voters and go all in on Latinos and immigration.\" The story, which quotes extensively from Latino Decisions principal Sylvia Manzano, includes the key data point based on ongoing Latino Decisions research: \"this year Latino voters already feel more motivated by mid-April than they did one day before voting in 2012.\" Eleveld assessed that, \"Latino voters could be the single most powerful voting bloc in 2016\" and that \"immigration might perhaps be the single most penetrating progressive issue of the election\u2014IF Democrats play their cards right.\" Unfortunately, the raids are a prime example of Democrats not playing their cards right. As a range of observers are noting, the planned raids have the potential to undermine Latinos' sky-high motivation and enthusiasm during a year in which Democrats cannot afford any drop-off in Latino enthusiasm. In a recent Salon column, progressive strategist Henry Fernandez noted , that while demographics provide the Democrats with an advantage in the Electoral College, \"if Latino voters turn out at worse levels than what occurred in 2008 and 2012, it becomes much more likely that the Republican nominee will get elected president.\" Fernandez then envisions the potential conditions \"under which this Latino turnout drought could occur,\" noting that, \"The Obama Administration would need to engage in deportation raids across the country primarily targeting Latino families and children \u2026 Grassroots organizing and widespread coverage in Spanish Language media would make the raids and the pain they create for families well known among Latino voters \u2026 The raids would need to be blamed on the current Democratic president.\" Mar\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, Washington Correspondent for the nation's largest daily Spanish-language newspaper La Opini\u00f3n, writes on how the raids could affect efforts to register and mobilize Latino voters for the upcoming election. Her story (translation by America's Voice), \"Election-year raids could affect Latino vote, activists warn,\" quotes Danny Cendejas of Detention Watch Network, who says that even though many Latinos will vote against Trump for his anti-immigrant rhetoric, \"people always look for a reason to vote and these raids are a scathing reminder of the lack of confidence on Barack Obama by a vast majority of the Latino community \u2026 Many Latino voters will remember Obama's unfulfilled (2008) promises \u2026 It remains to be seen if the Democratic candidates will remain committed to the rights and dignity of immigrants living in the U.S.\" Pe\u00f1a's piece also quotes immigration advocate Angie Kelley of the Center for American Progress, \"It's difficult to imagine how civic engagement strategies can succeed, when one day Hispanic households receive a knock on the door asking them to register to vote, and the next day they are afraid to open the door.\" And Gustavo Torres of CASA of Maryland and Virginia tells the Washington Post , \"The president is sending a message that he doesn't care about our community, and it is going to have a political price \u2026 [Latinos] are not going to vote for Trump, so what option do they have? They're going to stay home.\" The announcement of the planned raids \u2013 and the immigration debate as a whole \u2013 are not just abstract issues for millions of Latino voters across the nation. As data from recent Latino Decisions polling underscores, Latino voters have a personal connection to the immigration debate \u2013 57% of Latino voters know someone who is undocumented; one-third of Latino voters (34%) know someone who has faced deportation or detention for immigration reasons; and one-third of Latino voters (33%) know someone who has applied for DACA. According to Frank Sharry, Executive Director of America's Voice, \"The planned raids are wrong as policy, abhorrent from a moral perspective, and potentially harmful to Democrats' political hopes this November. If the Administration continues down this path it's up to Democrats in Congress and advocates from across the country to demand a course correction.\" Follow Frank Sharry and America's Voice on Twitter: @FrankSharry and @AmericasVoice America's Voice-- Harnessing the power of American voices and American values to win common sense immigration reform www.americasvoiceonline.org ### {new} partners | nicky vogt | 202.331.2389 (o) | 610.389.1314 (c) -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Communications Table\" group.

{"text":"Begin forwarded message: From: American Bridge Press > Date: May 19, 2016 at 8:58:49 PM EDT To: > Subject: Donald Trump in 2006: I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks Reply-To: American Bridge Press > CNN: Donald Trump in 2006: I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, Donald Trump said he was hoping for a crash. \"I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,\" Trump said in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University, answering a question about \"gloomy predictions that the real estate market is heading for a spectacular crash.\" The U.S. housing bubble burst two years later, triggering the stock market crash of 2008 that plunged the U.S. economy into a deep recession, leaving millions of Americans unemployed. Trump was speaking with Jon Ward, a marketing consultant who \"masterminded all the initial education programs for Trump University,\" according to his website. The audiobook is available on iTunes. \"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money,\" Trump said in the 2006 audio book, \"How to Build a Fortune.\" \"If you're in a good cash position -- which I'm in a good cash position today -- then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Few, including Trump, predicted the 2008 crash or the magnitude of the recession that would ensue. \"I'm not a believer that the interest market -- that the real estate market is going to take a big hit,\" Trump said in the same interview. But Trump's comments in the audio book, a project of his Trump University -- which is currently facing three lawsuits representing thousands of former students -- underscore the challenges the billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee will increasingly face in the general election as comments from his life before politics return to haunt him. Trump has come under fire for a slew of remarks he made before entering the presidential fray last year, from misogynistic comments about women to statements on certain issues that undercut his current policy positions. But in beating back such criticism, Trump has sought to convince voters that, despite his multiple flirtations with running for president over the last two decades, he never planned to run for president, \"Don't forget, I was never going to run for office,\" he has said. Trump, who has staked his candidacy on his wealth and business acumen, has also been unabashed about prioritizing his business interests above all else -- even when it has involved helping politicians with policy positions antithetical to his own. He defended his hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats by saying that he \"got along with everybody\" in order to boost his business. Trump has also defended the bankruptcies several of his businesses have undergone, saying he has \"taken advantage of the laws of this country,\" even as thousands of his employees lost their jobs as a result. And he has also defended manufacturing much of his merchandise abroad, including in countries like China. But as he launched his presidential bid last June, Trump flipped the script and struck a decisively populist tone --pledging take on very same self-interested maneuvers of businesses that he also employed -- and vowed to compel U.S. businesses to manufacture in the U.S. and slammed the influence of special interests in Washington.

{"text":"NYT - AT&T to Buy DirecTV for $48.5B AT&T to Buy DirecTV for $48.5B By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and DAVID GELLES May 18, 2014 Updated, 5:53 p.m. | AT&T formally agreed on Sunday to buy DirecTV for about $48 billion, striking a merger that will further reshape how Americans pay for television and connect to the Internet. It will join a growing list of telecommunications giants looking to consolidate their industry, creating bigger national carriers as they adapt to the shifts in broadband and video access. Already, Comcast has bid to solidify itself as one of the dominant high-speed Internet providers by seeking to buyTime Warner Cable for $45 billion. AndSprint, which is controlled by the Japanese telecom company SoftBank, has made no secret of its desire to merge with T-Mobile USA. \"The media chessboard is moving more this year than it has in the past decade,\" said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \"You're seeing major shifts. Everyone is jockeying for position.\" By acquiring the country's biggest satellite television operator, AT&T will help bolster its competitive position against Comcast. Though pay television is considered a mature market whose subscriber growth has slowed sharply in recent years, the business nonetheless generates billions of dollars in cash. Through the acquisition, AT&T will transform itself from a relatively small player in the sector to the second-biggest provider, coming in second only to Comcast. AT&T has about 5.7 million TV customers through its U-verse service, while the satellite TV operator has about 20.3 million customers in the United States. Under the agreement's terms, AT&T will pay $95 a share in stock and cash, roughly 10 percent above DirecTV's closing stock price on Friday and about 30 percent higher than where its shares were trading before word of a potential transaction began to emerge. Including the assumption of DirecTV's debt, the deal is valued at about $67.1 billion. Existing DirecTV shareholders would own 15 percent to 16 percent of the combined company after closing, which is expected in a year's time. The deal is the biggest in years for AT&T, which has long looked to acquisitions for growth. It is the largest transaction that the company has announced since its aborted $39 billion offer for T-Mobile three years ago, a takeover fiercely opposed by antitrust regulators because it would have cut the number of wireless phone service providers. This time, the company is likely to face less heat from the federal government. Regulators are considered likely to look favorably upon a deal that creates a bulwark against a strengthened Comcast. \"They want wireless to compete with wires,\" Mr. Greenfield said. \"The only way to complete that is to allow these deals to occur.\" And at the same time, by moving forward with its DirecTV deal now, AT&T will most likely complicate regulatory approvals for the cable television merger, according to several investment bankers. But it is unclear whether shareholders and analysts will show enthusiasm for the DirecTV takeover, questioning the strategic fit. \"When I first heard the news, I was scratching my head,\" said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research. \"Satellite is kind of a doomed technology. I don't see it being a long-term proposition.\" Part of the attraction may be DirecTV's ample cash flow. While its business has shown little growth in recent years, it generated about $8 billion in earnings last year. Much of that will go toward investments in growth, AT&T said, including bidding at least $9 billion for wireless network capacity that the government plans to auction off soon. By gaining satellite TV, AT&T may also be able to free up capacity on its existing broadband network. The acquisition will also bring DirecTV's existing content agreements at a time when AT&T has made video services a priority. The satellite TV company's offerings include the National Football League's Sunday Ticket, and it owns minority stakes in networks like Game Show Network, MLB Network and the Sundance Channel. Buying DirecTV will also expand AT&T's presence in Latin America, where the satellite company already has more than 18 million customers and expects to grow substantially as more households subscribe to pay TV services. DirecTV, meanwhile, will become part of a huge parent with multiple service offerings, solving the pressing problem of slowing growth. AT&T intends to pay for the deal with cash on hand, debt and the sale of some assets. To help ease regulatory concerns in Latin America, the company plans to sell its roughly 8 per","label":0}

{"text":"The attached spreadsheet contains a preliminary analysis of projected capacity growth for Indonesia through the year 2005. While I feel reasonably comfortable with the numbers and the timing of projects coming online, some additional work will be required to gain 100% confidence in this information.

In addition, as the trend of replacing mixed tropical hardwood with higher quality plantation acacia is already underway, I will make an attempt to identify the timber resources of the largest market pulp producers and when they anticipate initiating production of acacia pulp. Given the scope of this project, it may require several weeks to complete. Finally, I'm considering implementing a monitoring system similiar to the one already covering the Brazilian producers so we can accurately track activity by the Indonesian producers. The information I've seen from PPPC, and particularly RISI, does not appear to be very accurate. However, if anyone has an alternative source for shipments, production, inventory, etc. data, I'm open to suggestions. In any case, I hope this assists in shedding some light on an otherwise difficult region, and, as always, I welcome your feedback. Thanks. Karen","label":0}

However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation. It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year. A ballpark estimate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG\/TW fair value companies were excluded as they were last year. That would mean a factor of 19.0% rather than 19.1%.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement: \"We join all Ohioans in celebrating the restoration of Golden Week - the period when citizens can both register and vote at the same time - and we congratulate the Ohio Democratic Party for their hard work protecting the right to vote. Golden Week was created following the disastrous 2004 election, when Ohioans waited in line for over 6 hours to cast a ballot. It's clear why Republicans attacked this measure - when fewer people participate in the electoral process, Republican candidates do better at the polls. That's why Republicans in Ohio and elsewhere are going to court to defend laws designed to make it harder for women, working people, communities of color, students, the elderly, and others to vote. By contrast, Democrats are going to court to defend the right to vote - our most fundamental right - and reverse this culture of discrimination and disenfranchisement.\" ### To be automatically unsubscribed from this list, please email: dncrrmain-unsubscribe@dnc.org","label":0}

{"text":"SL: ICYMI: Buzzfeed: Trump Ally Roger Stone Admits That Trump Posed As His Own PR Man On Friday, Donald Trump flatly denied that his voice was the one found on tapes of conversations with a publicist named \"John Miller.\" Trump said was not pretending to be his own publicist on multiple occasions during dealings with reporters over the past three decades. Now, his longtime political advisor, Roger Stone, has said that Trump did, in fact, impersonate publicists on a routine basis. See the full article below. Trump Ally Roger Stone Admits That Trump Posed As His Own PR Man By Nathan McDermott \/\/ Buzzfeed News Roger Stone, a longtime political ally and former campaign adviser to Donald Trump, admitted on Saturday that Trump posed as his own publicist in the early 1990s, likening Trump's actions to the Founding Fathers. On Friday, The Washington Post published audio of a 1991 interview between a People magazine reporter and a man who identified as John Miller. The Post and other outlets identified Miller as actually being Trump, but in an interview on Today, Trump denied the accusation. Stone, who was on Breitbart radio on Saturday, dismissed the story, but admitted Trump posed as his own PR man. \"They focus on whether or not Donald Trump may or may not have posed as a public relations man in order to get his spin and his side of the story,\" Stone said of theWashington Post story, \"This is ridiculous. James Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton - they all wrote under pseudonyms, they all had things they wanted to say, and they wrote under pseudonyms.\" \"Trump wanted to get his spin and his side of the story, so he handled the press call himself, probably because he didn't want to pay a public relations expert. What difference does it make?\" Stone added that there are more important stories for the media to cover, such as Hillary Clinton's role in the death of four Americans in Benghazi or her ongoing email scandal.","label":0}

Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement in response to April's January's jobs report that showed 160,000 new jobs created74 straight months of private-sector job growth, an increase in average hourly earnings at an annual rate of 3.2% so far this year, and a decline in the number of long-term unemployed by 150,000: \"April's jobs report is more proof that the hard work being done by President Obama and Congressional Democrats to rebuild the economy after the Great Recession is paying off. There is no denying that 74 straight months of private-sector job growth - the longest stretch on record - is progress that American workers and families can count on. More importantly, this month's report showed a strong increase in wages, which hardworking families need and deserve, and a large drop in the number of long-term unemployed. We still have a lot of work to do to strengthen middle-class and working families, but it's clear that the economy has undergone a remarkable turnaround from where we were seven years ago. \"This concrete progress also offers a stark contrast to what Donald Trump has promised to do as president. His reckless plans would hurt working families, destabilize our economy, and drag our country back to where we were when the last Republican president left office - losing 800,000 jobs a month. Dangerous Donald's real-life record is already riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expense of everyday Americans. We cannot afford to let him do the same thing from the Oval Office. \"We need a forward-looking president leader in the Oval Office who will build on the progress we've already made and who will ensure that we have an economy that works for everyone - not just the wealthy few. We must elect a Democrat as our next president.\"","label":0}

Best, Doyle ________________________________ ARTICLE TEXT: CHALLENGED: Program identifies troubled students By Ann-Margaret Lambo New Castle News For some kids, and their parents, growing up can be like making their way through a mine field. Each step is potentially dangerous and can result in dire consequences depending on the choices made. Some young people get through it unscathed. Others don't. Luckily, local parents can rest a little easier thanks to the Student Assistance Program, or SAP. The goal of this Human Services Center program, which has been in existence since 1988, is to help identify students who are experiencing difficulties which prevent them from learning and achieving success in school. Every middle and high school in Lawrence County, and the state of Pennsylvania, has a student assistance program. Dan Barnes, who has 35 years experience working with kids and their families, and his staff of two, meet with guidance counselors, administrators and teachers from every school district in the county, every week of the school year. They receive referrals from these teams of professional about students who may be having trouble coping for a number of reasons. Barnes estimates that over the years, the student assistance program has assisted thousands of kids. And it's a good thing that Lawrence County's kids have SAP available to them. Consider these national statistics, provided by Columbia University's TeenScreen program. -In the United States, 21 percent of youth suffer from a mental health condition serious enough to cause impairment. -Every year, 3.4 million U.S. high school students think seriously about killing themselves. -Almost 2 million high school students report having made a prior suicide attempt. More than 600,000 students report having made an attempt that required medical attention. \"Life today can be overwhelming for our kids,\" Barnes commented. \"Life is a lot more complex. And I don't care how strong you are as a kid, the media and peer pressure is huge. If you don't quite fit the mold makes it really tough on kids. There is tremendous pressure on kids today as far as fitting in, being accepted and achieving in our school systems.\" Once a child has been identified, Barnes or one of the professionals he works with, will contact the parent or guardian of the child to obtain written permission for the SAP process to begin. Together, school representatives, parents and guardians as well as SAP team members develop an action plan to improve success in school. This can be achieved in a number of ways, including tutoring or peer mentoring as well as through other services from community-based agencies. \"We stay in the background as a resource for them (families),\" Barnes explained. \"This program does not provide counseling. It provides assessment and consultation. We make recommendations, which can be anything from what the parents can do at home, to telling them that a son or daughter needs professional help. We assist families in navigating the mental health system as well.\" \"We feel good because we have a chance in some of these kids' lives to identify problems that can be treated successfully,\" Barnes said, \"rather then taking its course and then finding out as an adult that it has developed into a more serious mental health problem that is harder to treat,\" Barnes added. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

{"text":"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron. The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

{"text":"To all you mothers out there - a VERY HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY! Thank you for all you've done and are doing! Moreover, I want to take this mother's day to make a solemn pledge to help and protect all mothers. I suggest all of us do the same. Today, on Mother's Day, a horrible article appeared in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. It is not aimed at helping mothers; it is aimed at ensnaring more mothers into the mental health system. You want to know why I care? Because my own mother is a psych victim. She raised 3 childen alone and did a fine job. My most vivid memories of youth are of my mother working away at the sewing machine, softly singing a hymm, happily working to provide food and shelter for her family, and her invalid sister who lived with us. Then, with no previous history, she experienced a psychotic break due to several weeks of lost sleep. She fell into the hands of psychiatry and was never the same. Psych drugs caused her to have constant involuntary hand movements, akathesia it's called, and she could no longer sew. Incarceration and forced drugs stopped her singing as well. Is that what you want for America's mothers? Your assignment: 1. Read or skim over this: TEXT AT THE BOTTOM 2. Write a strong letter to the editor and send it by clicking on #submit The article is full of false information. I suggest you pick one thing about it you don't agree with and really hammer home a message about why psychiatry is not going to \"honor\" mothers or anyone else. 3. Report compliance by email. Oh, and all you mothers can take today off. Write it tomorrow or Tuesday. Much love, Doyle _____________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Honor your mother: Act against depression By BARBARA LAWTON Posted: May 13, 2006 A mother grows accustomed to being caught in cross currents. How many of us shouldered guilt first for pushing a child to take piano lessons and guilt again for allowing her to quit? Advertisement When we give life, we take on what seem at times to be impossible tasks. In fact, mothers used to be blamed for actually being the cause of no end of mental illnesses in their children - autism and schizophrenia and dozens more. Now it is time to turn the tables. Let's honor our mothers and their memories by addressing the role we can play in reducing the high incidence of depression among Wisconsin women. There is work to be done. Wisconsin ranked 48th in a recent national study for the average number of poor mental health days experienced per month by women. According to the World Health Organization, major depression is the leading cause of disease-related disability among women worldwide. Depression affects women of all ages, affects twice as many women as men, occurs more frequently among women living in poverty, is common among women who have been victims of violence, occurs as early as age 15 and is linked biologically to hormonal changes, most notably in high incidence among premenstrual and especially postpartum women. And add in the fact that the lifetime risk for depression in children with a depressed mother has been estimated at 45%. I named a task force of high level academics and practitioners in both psychology and psychiatry, along with business leaders, public health officials, consumer advocates and experts in corrections and the law, to give us a clearer picture of the factors contributing to the status of women related to mental health. Their report is an invitation to all of us to respond to the compelling data that describe a status quo we cannot afford in Wisconsin. Untreated mental illness, and depression specifically, has far-reaching implications for all Wisconsin citizens. Not one of us is more than one degree removed from someone who has suffered at least an episode of mental illness, and the economic impact on employers and the state as a whole is significant. Those suffering from depression are seven times more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. Medical costs of depressed people average twice those who are not depressed. And educational achievement and earnings are significantly compromised. The report emphasizes that the incidence and severity of depression are clearly linked to rates of poverty, economic inequities owing to gender and to violence against women both as children and as adults. And women of color are disproportionately more likely to experience depression and are less likely to be in a position to access treatment. The good news is that depression is highly treatable and can, in many cases, be prevented. The task force report creates a roadmap to progress in this critical area of medicine that has been too long misunderstood, sidelined for its complexity and for the old-fashioned prejudices, born of misunderstanding, that have attached to mental illness. Everyone - men and women and children - stand to benefit from the work driven forward in response to this report. Where do they suggest we start? The state Legislature must present the governor with a bill to ensure insurance coverage of treatment for mental illness in parity with coverage for physical illness. Minnesota has had a parity law in place for 11 years. Thirty-three states already have one, and fiscal analyses show that mental health parity is cost effective. We will also ask for a legislative council study committee on mental health issues facing Wisconsin's women to evaluate access to services and the marketplace factors inherent to access, quantify the cost-effectiveness of treatment alternatives and identify an effective means to screen for postpartum depression. We need to empower employers and employees alike with the information they need to work with insurance companies to provide coverage that pays for effective treatment of depression. Some very smart Wisconsin corporations have already developed programs that educate employees about warning signs and risk factors for depression and work to eliminate stigma and provide supportive work environments for those experiencing depression. Let's share those models widely among businesses in our state. There is widespread responsibility for better education and training to address depression and help eliminate the stigma that attaches to it, from the state's Department of Health and Family Services and the Department of Public Instruction, to our University of Wisconsin system and the Medical College of Wisconsin. We must improve the education of providers and the prescribed protocols that govern their work, starting with accurate information about women and depression in introductory psychology courses and extending to specific training in medical, pharmacy, nursing and other mental health specialty programs. The public value of the task force report is extraordinary, and I invite you to read about it on www.ltgov.state.wi.us. The report serves as a textbook that moves from a good working definition of depression to an assessment of the status quo in terms of delivery of service and obstacles to treatment to clear ways that we can set up better circumstances for prevention and increase access to treatment. The task force points to areas where data is needed to both evaluate work in the field and to build the case for change. As lieutenant governor, I am all too aware of the need to meet our now-urgent workforce demands with healthy women and men who have been positioned to achieve the education and training necessary to make their best contribution to our economy. Reducing the incidence of depression is a smart and cost-effective workforce development strategy. To mark Mental Health Awareness Month in Wisconsin and the beginning of Women's Health Week, I will travel to La Crosse Monday with another mother, former Wisconsin first lady and health activist Sue Ann Thompson. We will be at the Southside Neighborhood Center, 1300 S. 6th St., at noon to talk about our shared commitment to reduce the incidence of depression in Wisconsin and introduce more women to recovery and prevention. Honor your mother by joining us in this important work. Barbara Lawton is lieutenant governor of Wisconsin. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam? Yahoo!

Ruben Gallego will hold a press call today to discuss how Trump's reckless plans will not only impede the economic success of Latino families but also damage America's economic growth. It's a fact: a Donald Trump presidency would put the Latino community at risk. He's called for a tax plan that would vastly widen the wealth gap for Latinos by giving $3 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires, and said he'd leave the minimum wage to the states rather than setting a Federal minimum. From creating additional economic barriers to the prosperity of Latino families to seriously hurting the U.S. economy through his mass deportation plan, Trump is a risk the Latino community cannot afford. Perez and Gallego will outline the devastating economic consequences of Trump's agenda for America.

{"text":"Threw cruz in at the end for voting against VAWA, along with a majority of Congressional and Senate GOP From: Freundlich, Christina Sent: Monday, May 02, 2016 1:58 PM To: Walker, Eric; Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Walsh, Tom Subject: RE: draft -- Trump rape release Updated with one change From: Freundlich, Christina Sent: Monday, May 02, 2016 1:56 PM To: Walker, Eric; Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Walsh, Tom Subject: draft -- Trump rape release Take a look and then we can throw a title on there. It's a little bland Just last week, Trump proudly announced endorsements from two \"tough guys \" - Mike Tyson and Bobby Knight. Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992, and Bobby Knight once said \"I think if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.\" After days of touting the endorsement of Mike Tyson, turns out that Donald Trump's misogynistic and backwards defense on violence against women, specifically related to Mike Tyson, steam decades back : Trump controversially suggested in 1992 Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving a jail sentence and as reported earlier this week by BuzzFeed News said in the early '90s that Tyson was \"railroaded\" in his case, and that the victim had willingly entered Tyson's room. In another instance in late 1992, Trump discussed the case at length in an interview with Charlie Rose. The topic centered around a New York magazine profile in which Trump said his mother was angry at him for defending Tyson. In the piece, Trump said Tyson told him the victim \"wanted it real bad.\" Donald Trump thinks he can fool us into how presidential he is going to be, and how much he loves women - but the warped and backwards view of violence and rape is who Donald Trump has been for years. Now, sexual violence advocates are livid that Donald Trump has been saying that China is going to \"rape\" America. When someone like Donald Trump uses a heinous crime like rape as a metaphor, it's an insult to all sexual assault victims and survivors. Preventing violence against women has garnered widespread support among voters, but a majority of Republicans in Congress, including Ted Cruz, still voted against the Violence Against Women Act in 2013. By contrast, Democrats have been committed to preventing violence against women and extending support to survivors. Republicans like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are showing no respect and dignity for those 300,000 victims of sexual violence and rape each year - all the more reason why we can't have a Republican be the 45th president of the United States.","label":0}

{"text":"Fellow National Socialists: For 60 days now a battle has been waged behind the NSM scenes between the NSM Commander and a lot of NSM rank and file because of his web team consisting of Mike Connelly, Cathy Griggs, and John Schafer. The NSM Commander has given them free authority to do as they please in the Forums and New Saxon without ever disciplining them. For six months, I have received steady requests by NSM members and friends of the NSM to do something about the web team because of their tyrannical and unjust ways of banning people and cussing at people. Recently, I discovered a secret room in the Forums (so did Jim Ramm) where they regularly meet and post messages about NSM members behind their backs and the NSM Commander participates and allows it. This is bad character on the part of them all and the reason the NSM Commander expelled me (I did not resign as he is telling people) and came up with that lie of me and others being defeatist. Is defeatism running as the first National Socialist for President in the USA, 24\/7, and giving up a $50,000 a year job to do so? Is defeatism being a National Socialist for over 33 years? Is defeatism running the first NSM candidate for office last year in Montana and obtaining 17.5% of the vote which is astounding? Your Commander lies and undermines more than Bill White does. I don't agree with Bill White or like his tactics but I think he learned it from Jeff Schoep. Has the NSM Commander been honest with you and told you his reckless character got him a DUI and dues are paying the increased auto insurance premium along with the high price tag of his Mustang. Must be nice to live high on the hog on your dues money and you see little in return. Go ask Jeff Schoep what happened to that NSM Scholarship fund that NSM members generously donated into? He will tell you it's (his puppet master John Schafer will back him up and lie for him) still there. It isn't! NSM Commander told Nick Chappell at the Omaha Rally it was used to move the Commander and his family. If you don't believe it, have you seen it issued to any high school student yet? Not. Also, the NSM Commander has barely made any effort to push the 2008 Presidential election campaign. When people were making a fuss about his lack of enthusiasm about it he would occasionally take up a collection once in awhile (like the book burning and National Meeting). I accuse him of deliberately sabotaging it. He is a saboteur. His lack of effort along with the web team chasing and banning potential contributors in the Forum away destroyed the Presidential campaign. Also, the NSM Commander called the former NSM Viking Youth Corps Director a defeatist. Does a defeatist take his inheritance and buy a building so the NSM could regularly meet there and be safe? Within the last week, the NSM Commander along with his web team and himself have lost the NW Regional Leader, NSM Viking Youth Corps Director, NSM Election Director, Meeting Hall in SC, and its 2008 Presidential candidate, plus so many members it would make your head spin. Notice he doesn't mention the number of NSM members that wrote him back about his e-mail about loyalty and oath that resigned. I showed that e-mail to genuine German National Socialists from the 1930's-1940's and they laughed at it explaining that he was wrong and isn't a National Socialist. They thought a Marxist wrote it at first. They explained that the message conveys that NSM members are suppose to have strict and faithful loyalty to their leader without question. They point out that this isn't National Socialist thinking from the NSDAP because a leader is suppose to have responsibility of making proper decisions downward. Responsibility comes with leadership and making decisions. The former NSDAP leaders explained that Schoeps interpretation was Marxist thinking or tyrannical thinking because the message insisted that everyone must be loyal and faithful with nothing in return from the leadership. Go back and read it yourself and you will see. There will come a day when you get the boot. Remember my words here. In the meantime, I have a White House to take and my campaign continues. In fact, donations started to pour in again this morning because I don't have the NSM Commander sabotaging the election anymore. PS. Captain Ludaka and the entire NW NSM have just resigned. Southern NSM Units are doing the same. One more thing, the NSM Commander has lost the NSM Meeting Hall in SC as well. He's batting #1000 today. Best regards, John Taylor Bowles, Expelled NSM 2008 Presidential Candidate.

Sanders writes in a letter to Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz that the makeup of the standing committees should reflect the level of support that he and Clinton received in the primaries and caucuses. He says many of his supporters have not been included and notes Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy will be in charge of the convention's platform committee and former Massachusetts Rep.

{"text":"By Dan Diamond | 05\/17\/2016 10:00 AM EDT A House subcommittee debates whether CMS should kill a controversial demo, and researchers find that the nation's uninsured level just hit a historic new low. But first: A major development in the Zika funding fight looms today. SENATE ON VERGE OF APPROVING ZIKA REQUEST - The Senate is likely to approve a $1.1 billion Zika funding package today as part of a transportation funding bill. But that's not the whole story. - Where they stand: Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, one of the amendment's crafters, told PULSE she is \"hopeful\" of passage. Republican Sen. Richard Burr told us that he's a \"yes,\" too, and he expects enough Republican support. However, several Republicans told us yesterday evening that they were still reviewing the language and not ready to commit to approval. - What else is on tap: The Senate will also vote on an amendment to fully fund the $1.9 billion White House request and not pay for it (which is expected to get Democratic support) and a $1.1 billion package that is funded with ACA cuts, among other pay-fors (which will get GOP support, but Democratic backing is unlikely). HOUSE TARGETING LOWER LEVEL OF ZIKA FUNDING - House appropriators on Monday introduced a $622.1 million emergency funding bill responding to the Zika virus outbreak, about a third of what the White House has sought to combat the mosquito-borne virus. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said the bill - which draws on $352 million in unspent Ebola funds and another $270 million in HHS's administrative budget, and does not include new money - will be taken up by his committee this week. The White House has failed to justify its budget request, Rogers said - Democrats say GOP is playing Zika politics with Clean Water Act. A House GOP bill called the Zika Vector Control Act contains the same language as the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, which creates exemptions to the Clean Water Act's restrictions on pesticide use. The legislation, which is on the suspension calendar for Tuesday, \"has nothing to do with Zika and everything to do with Republicans' relentless special interest attacks on the Clean Water Act,\" said Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. \"It is shameful that House Republicans have decided the Zika crisis is nothing more than an opportunity to eliminate protections for the water our children drink.\" - The Mosquito Control Association disagrees with Democrats. In a letter, the not-for-profit group offers its \"enthusiastic support\" for Republicans' measure. \"This amendment addresses a situation that has placed mosquito control activities under substantial legal jeopardy,\" the association wrote on Monday. \"Mosquito control programs are vulnerable to lawsuits for simple paperwork violations of the Clean Water Act ... where fines may be up to $35,000 per day for activities that do not involve harm to the environment.\" Read the letter:  THIS IS TUESDAY PULSE - Where we're truly wondering if Sen. Marco Rubio is going to do chest or legs at the gym today. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter, especially if you're a source close to the senator. With help from Brianna Ehley (@briannaehley), Jen Haberkorn (@jenhab) and Sarah Karlin-Smith (@SarahKarlin). PREVIEW: TODAY'S HEARING ON THE FUTURE OF THE PART B DEMO - The 10 a.m. House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee hearing isn't likely to go CMS's way. Nearly all House Republicans have signed on to a letter seeking to kill the demonstration to test new ways to pay for physician-administered drugs, and the committee plans to discuss Rep. Larry Bucshon's bill to end the project. - What you'll hear: \"Misguided,\" \"ill-conceived,\" and \"harmful,\" will be some of the negative refrains from witnesses - along with the verb \"withdraw.\" But the hearing may be more balanced than some might have thought. Two of the five witnesses offered strong support for the Part B demo in prepared testimony, Pro's Sarah Karlin notes. \"My personal Catch-22 is that while drugs are keeping me alive, I am going through my savings at an alarming rate,\" said Heather Block, a stage four cancer patient, in prepared testimony. \"In all the uproar over this proposal, I have yet to hear anyone say that the current system is working.\" Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, said the demonstration must move forward if the government wants to achieve its overall goal of transitioning Medicare to a system that reimburses for health care based on value - a concept supported by many of the Part B demo's detractors, including physicians and hospitals. - Even critics of the demo want changes to drug prices. Michael Schweitz, the national advocacy chair for the coalition of state rheumatology organizations, and an opponent of the proposal, wrote that the increases in drug prices \"are unsustainable for Medicare and beneficiaries.\" But Medicare's proposal doesn't directly address drug prices, he said. Hearing information and links to all testimony:  ** A message from PhRMA: PhRMA member companies invested $58.8 billion in research and development in 2015, up 10.3 percent from 2014, new data show. For more than 30 years, the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry has led the world in the development of medicines, and PhRMA member companies continue to be at the forefront. Learn more. ** SENATE DEMS AGAIN BACK DEMO - \"We believe that with refinements, the Demonstration can be an integral part of the administration's commitment to lowering health care costs and improving quality for our nation's Medicare beneficiaries,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 10 colleagues wrote on Monday night to HHS and CMS leaders.  OBAMA: FULL COURT WOULDN'T HAVE PUNTED ON ZUBIK - The president said on Monday that he suspects the Zubik v. Burwell outcome would have been different had the court had a full bench. \"I won't speculate as to why [the court] punted but my suspicion is that if we had nine Supreme Court justices instead of eight, there might have been a different outcome,\" President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed. The court unanimously remanded the case on Monday, telling the lower courts to find a solution that allows religious institutions to object to providing birth control but also keeps intact Obamacare's coverage protections. JUST 9.1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS ARE UNINSURED - That's according to new National Health Interview Survey estimates out today, and it represents the lowest uninsured level on record. The survey, which goes through 2015, shows consistent declines in the uninsured rate beginning in 2013, as Affordable Care Act coverage expansion began to take effect. See the data:  - More Americans have private insurance than before the ACA took effect. About 63.2 percent of all Americans were covered through private health insurance in 2015, up from 59.5 percent in 2013 and 60.2 percent in 2010. The explanation: More than 10 million Americans bought private coverage through the ACA exchanges. - Poverty is still a differentiator. About one-quarter of adults ages 18-64 who were poor or near-poor were uninsured in 2015, versus just 7.6 percent of all other adults. POLITICO Pro Health Care Report - Reaching the Tipping Point: Health Care Delivery Reform: A conversation about regional variation in health care delivery system reform. How are different parts of the country responding to the push for value-based payment in the public and private sectors? Why do delivery and payment reforms take root in some markets but not others? I'll be moderating this with POLITICO's Executive Editor for Health Care, Joanne Kenen. Thursday, May 19 - Doors at 8:00 a.m.; W Hotel - 515 15th St NW.RSVP:  ICYMI: OKLAHOMA EYEING MEDICAID EXPANSION - Republican leaders are looking to plug a $1.3 billion hole in the state's budget by expanding Medicaid to bring in billions of federal dollars. The still-developing plan would be based on Indiana's approach to Medicaid expansion and represent a significant reversal: Gov. Mary Fallin has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act.  IN CASE YOU REALLY MISSED IT - Pros got wind of Oklahoma's expansion proposal in early April. Details from Rachana Pradhan here. SEEKING A PSYCHIATRIST THROUGH DC EXCHANGE? PREPARE TO BE STRESSED OUT - In the metro D.C. area, 86 percent of network psychiatrists were either not reachable or not able to schedule a new visit, according to the American Psychiatric Association. The organization performed a secret-shopping study by contacting a random sample of 150 psychiatrists listed through the exchange. \"The Affordable Care Act is intended to expand access to mental health and substance use disorder care, yet networks are shrinking,\" said APA's leader Saul Levin. He added that psychiatrists are dropping out of the networks available on the ACA exchanges because of \"unreasonable administrative burden\" and low reimbursement rates, while plans continue to narrow their networks and prune the list of available providers. PROTON THERAPY CENTERS HAVE DOUBLED WORLDWIDE IN PAST FIVE YEARS - More hospitals are investing in the technology, which had been scrutinized for its high price and questionable cost-effectiveness, as vendors roll out smaller and less expensive centers.  AN ANTI-AGING DRUG IS FOR THE DOGS - Researchers are using dogs to test a drug that slows some of the key effects of aging, according to a front-page New York Times story today.

New data show PhRMA member companies invested $58.8 billion in research and development in 2015, up 10.3 percent from 2014. The biopharmaceutical industry's long-term research and development investments have led to more medicines in clinical development than ever before, more than 7,000 medicines globally. From 2000 to 2015, more than 550 new medicines were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - including a record 56 new medicines in 2015. Given just 12 percent of medicines in clinical trials ever make it to patients it is critical we have pragmatic, pro-innovation policies to sustain the long-term investments needed to develop tomorrow's cures.

Superb Internet, $5More providers July 18, 2002 --Lindsey Turrentine Senior editor CNET Software and Internet Dear Readers, On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN 8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up with AOL? It just might. Find out more in our MSN 8.0 First Take. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies This week in Internet Services Ever heard of a type of lawsuit known as a cyberSLAPP? We hadn't either. A cyberSLAPP case typically involves \"a person who has posted anonymous criticisms of a corporation or public figure on the Internet,\" according to a coalition of privacy groups who are fighting to stop the practice. Find out more. First Take: MSN 8.0 Beta Redmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months, and now, the proof\"s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL? First Take: ICQ Lite Alpha One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at what cost? We take an early look. Looking for a new DSL provider?

In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future. We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market. To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business. We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO. In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Here's the post: [ Brand New Congress 3 hrs \u00b7 Hi Folks! Some of us Bernie volunteers and former staff have been talking about a campaign that would be big enough and worthwhile enough to keep the revolution going once Bernie is in office. We believe the way to achieve this is to elect a Brand New Congress in 2018. We're going to recruit non-politicians who truly represent their communities, with proven track records of service and integrity, to replace all of Congress in one unified campaign behind Bernie's platform--except of course the people who already support it.

I've inserted that, and also reworded the paragraph in the conclusions which talked about \"serious flaws\" along the lines suggested by Tim. It now reads: \"The IPCC2001 conclusion that temperatures of the past millennium are unlikely to have been as warm, at any time prior to the 20th century, as the last decades of the 20th century is supported by subsequent research and by the results obtained here. We have also reviewed and, in some cases, tested with new analysis, papers which claim to refute that IPCC2001 conclusion and found that their claims are not well supported.\" This version attached with the revised supplementary material.

The NASDAQ continues to consolidate above key fib support crossing at 1905.53. Closes above last week's high at 2010.91 are needed to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. The March S&P 500 index posted its highest close in nearly two and a half weeks on Thursday. The persistent rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1120.66 has set the stage for a possible test of December's high crossing at 1176 by early-January. The Dow posted a quiet inside day with a modestly higher close on Thursday as it consolidated above the 62% retracement level of the May\/September decline crossing at 10,094.10 at 10,088. Technology stocks supported today's rally however, trading volume was light due to the holidays. INTEREST RATES  March T-bonds closed higher on Thursday and in the process posted a key reversal up. Additional strength will be needed on Thursday to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern. However, closes above December's reaction high crossing at 102-05 will be need to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. Until then look for sideways trading to continue into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible. The CRB INDEX  The CRB index posted a key reversal down on Thursday due to weakness in cattle, precious metals, fiber, and energies. Today's high fell short of testing of the 25% retracement level of this year's decline crossing at 194.76. The CRB index is at a crossroads as it consolidates below the 25% retracement level and this year's downtrend line crossing near 195.35. Unless these resistance levels are cleared, it would appear as though a double top might be forming with today's bearish reversal pattern. ENERGY MARKETS  The energy markets closed lower on Thursday due to profit taking as the market position itself ahead of this week's API inventory report and Friday's OPEC meeting. The market is expecting this week's API inventory report to be bullish, which has helped temper some of today's losses. Light pressure also came from today's bearish AGA inventor report for natural gas, which was the second-smallest draw on inventories for the corresponding week in December since the AGA started its weekly report in 1994. February crude oil closed modestly lower on Thursday and settled below the previous reaction high crossing at 21.05. A late day rally tempered some of today's losses as February closed mid-range thereby leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. A bullish API inventory report on Friday could provide the catalyst needed to extend this month's rally. The 38% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 21.77, then November's high at 22.83 are potential targets later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term. February heating oil closed lower on Thursday but remained above broken resistance crossing at 57.80 thereby keeping the door open for a possible test of November's reaction high crossing at 64.35 later this winter. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January. February unleaded gas posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday as it consolidated some of Wednesday's gains, which appear to have been overdone. However, today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that additional gains are possible into early-January. If this week's rally continues, November's high crossing at 62.31 is February's next target. February Henry Hub natural gas closed sharply lower on Thursday following today's bearish AGA inventory report. The report showed a draw of 81 bcf on U.S. inventories, which was slightly above industry expectations however, there were too many people caught in January and were forced to liquidate, which pulled the rest of the contracts lower on the day. Several long-term weather forecasts are calling for a bitter cold snap towards mid-January, which might help limit, any short-term losses. However, traders are cautious about cold-weather predictions after two months of above normal temps this fall. Closes below 2.58 would renew this fall's decline as we begin the new year. CURRENCIES  The March Dollar closed lower on Thursday as it continues to consolidate some of Monday's gains. A rebound ahead of the close tempered some of today's loss leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. March's failure to close above November's high crossing at 118.27 on Thursday raises the possibility that this week's high might have marked a double top. If the rally continues, the 75% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 119.57 is March's next upside target. The March Swiss Franc closed higher on Thursday due to short covering. Session highs spiked above broken support crossing at .5973 however, March remained below this fall's trading range. I would not be surprised to see March consolidate below broken trading range support for the balance of the year. If the decline resumes, fib support crossing at .5722 is March's next target. The March Canadian Dollar posted a potential key reversal up on Thursday after testing November's low at .6230 earlier in the day. March's inability to push through this support level triggered a short covering rally however, gains were tempered due to a late-day sell off before the close. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. The March Japanese Yen extended its decline off September's high on Thursday and is poised to test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 in the near future. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into early-January. PRECIOUS METALS  February gold closed lower on Thursday and is breakout out below December's uptrend line crossing near 277.80. Multiple closes below this support level are needed to confirm today's trendline breakout, which would then open the door for sideways to lower prices into early-January. Today's decline turned stochastics and the RSI neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term top is in or near. March silver closed lower on Thursday and below the 62% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 4.51 thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in place or near. Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought and turning bearish with this week's setback warning bullish traders to use caution. A downturn by the ADX is needed to confirm that the rebound off November's high has come to an end. March copper closed lower on Thursday as it consolidated some of Wednesday's gain. March has become range bound between the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50 and below the reaction high crossing at 69.45. A breakout in either direction of this trading range is needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early- January. GRAINS  March corn closed higher on Thursday due to light short covering ahead of this week's export sales report due out Friday morning. Today's rebound fell short of testing broken support crossing at 2.10 1\/4 thereby leaving the door open for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1\/4 later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. Producer selling is almost non-existent and is likely to remain that way until mid-January when cash merchandisers expect producers to resume cash sales. March wheat closed higher on Thursday following today's announcement that Egypt purchased up to 120,000 metric tonnes of U.S. soft red winter wheat along with 180,000 metric tonnes of Australian standard white wheat. This news triggered a short covering rally that erased all of Wednesday's losses. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for sideways to higher trading on Friday if tomorrow's export sales report comes in neutral to friendly. From a broader perspective, March wheat needs to close above trendline resistance crossing near 2.94 or below trendline support crossing near 2.83 to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI returned to bullish modes with today's rally signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible near-term. SOYBEAN COMPLEX  March soybeans closed steady on Thursday as positioning ahead of January deliveries and year-end position squaring dominated today's trading. Strong U.S. exports and domestic demand are being offset by rising South American crop prospects and forecasts calling for record global ending stocks. This week's breakout below trading range support crossing at 4.32 1\/2 has opened the door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.23 1\/2 in the near future. March soybean meal closed slightly higher on Thursday due to light short covering amidst strong domestic demand. However, this week's move to new lows for December has opened the door for a likely test of April's low crossing at 142 later this winter. This week's export sales report is not expected to hold any surprises for the market, which will leave meal looking towards soybeans for near-term direction. It will take closes above this summer's downtrend line crossing near 151.90 to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. LIVESTOCK  February hogs posted an inside day with a higher close due to spillover support from sharply higher belly prices. Short covering ahead of Friday's quarterly hogs and pigs report also provided light support to the market. The trade is expecting tomorrow's report to be neutral to bullish. However, this month's run up in prices appears to have already factored in a modest amount of bullish news in the upcoming report. February hogs are poised to test this summer's downtrend line crossing near 56.40. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a larger- degree rebound into early-January. February cattle posted a downside reversal on Thursday, as traders were disappointed over the lack of an established cash price. While temps are running below normal across cattle feeding country, there are no storms to disrupt movement, which is short-term bearish. Technically, the door remains open for February cattle to try and test November's high crossing at 71.35. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that February cattle may struggle to overcome this resistance level. FOOD & FIBER  March coffee posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday as it consolidated some of last Friday's loss. Closes below 46.00 are needed to confirm last Friday's key reversal down, which would then set the stage for a likely test of this month's low crossing at 44.75. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later this winter. Expectations for a bumper Brazilian crop this spring along with expectations that Vietnam might be an aggressive seller of their crop after the first of the year will likely keep pressure on the market into January. March cocoa posted a key reversal on Thursday filling last week's gap at 1297. Thin holiday trading allowed local traders to run buy stops, which exaggerated today's rally. Meanwhile purchases at Ivory Coast ports are running well ahead of last year's pace during the height of the shipping season. March will need to close above 1365 or below 1212 to clear up near-term direction in the market. March sugar gapped above December's downtrend line on Thursday thereby confirming that last week's spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698 marked a short-term bottom. However, the mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Today's rally turned stochastics and the RSI bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January. March cotton posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday as it consolidates above the Nov.\/Dec. downtrend line. Trading was subdued ahead of tomorrow's weekly export sales report. Export demand needs to remain strong in order to sustain this week's anemic trendline breakout. News that China may see a significant cutback in cotton acreage this coming year also provided light support to the market.

{"text":"A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you. Please read this communication in detail. Purpose: Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building. A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year. Location: Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes. Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized. Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors. Timing. Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building. The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st. Testing. Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished. Telephones. Only regular phones will be available. For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment. Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort. Other supplies. The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs. If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat. Limited Access. The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment. To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage. Escalation Procedures. The plan will be as follows: I. During regular business hours A. Announcement. You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location. -OR- B. No Announcement. If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification. II. After hours For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work. E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.","label":0}
{"text":"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately. To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees. The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community. Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here. Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years. Ken Lay","label":0}

{"text":"Ray, Glad to see you're onto this. Obviously anything shouldn't make it even worse for Edouard, but you're in contact with him. I'd be happy to sign onto any letter from Science, but this isn't essential. I know the series Courtillot has used (and Pasotti re-uses) came from here, but it isn't what he and the authors says it was. I also know it doesn't make much difference if the correct one was used - given the smoothing. It is just sloppy and a principle thing. The correct data are sitting on our web site and have been since Brohan et al (2006) appeared in JGR. Even the earlier version (HadCRUT2v) would have been OK, but not a specially produced series for a tree-ring reconstruction paper back in 2001\/2 and not on our web site. Then there are all the science issues you and Edouard have raised in RC and the EPSL comment. I have had a couple of exchanges with Courtillot. This is the last of them from March 26, 2007. I sent him a number of papers to read. He seems incapable of grasping the concept of spatial degrees of freedom, and how this number can change according to timescale. I also told him where he can get station data at NCDC and GISS (as I took a decision ages ago not to release our station data, mainly because of McIntyre). I told him all this as well when we met at a meeting of the French Academy in early March. What he understands below is my refusal to write a paper for the proceedings of the French Academy for the meeting in early March. He only mentioned this requirement afterwards and I said I didn't have the time to rewrite was already in the literature. It took me several more months of emails to get my expenses for going to Paris! Cheers Phil From Courtillot 26 March 2007 Dear Phil, Sure I understand. Now research wise I would like us to remain in contact. Unfortunately, I have too little time to devote to what is in principle not in my main stream of research and has no special funding. But still I intend to try and persist. I find these temperature and pressure series fascinating. I have two queries: 1) how easy is it for me (not a very agile person computer wise) to obtain the files of data you use in the various global or non global averages of T (I mean the actual montly data in each 5\u00b0 box prior to any processing, including computation of the \"temperature anomaly\")? How do I do it? What I would like to be able to extract is for instance all of the data within a given 5\u00b0 by 5\u00b0 box with their dates (so: lat, lon, time, value). I understand these are monthly means, though we find that there may be some quite important information in the daily values which is likely lost on monthly averaging, but this is another question... 2) I know you answered my question but still I have trouble grasping the answer. Could you explain how the global T average for periods say before 1900 can haev a total uncertainty under 0.2\u00b0C back to 1850. This can only be true, given the data distribution in the Rayner et al paper, if T is an incredibly smooth function of location. Did you really answer me that by extracting from the recent (post 1950) database data with the same geographical and temporal distributions as the 1850-1900 data you get almost the same result as with the full modern data (with an uncertainty just above 0.1\u00b0C). This seems truly amazing, and would never work with the global magnetic field data I am accustomed to work on. Yet it does not seem to me that climate varies as slowly and with as long spatial scales as the magnetic field... I will very much appreciate your comments and help on those. Thank you again for having come to our meeting.

I am writing a letter to Science today regarding Pasotti's ridiculous article. If anybody things the rest of RC should sign on to that as well, just let me know. I will also have to write a Part III, covering all the junk mentioned by Edouard and by Phil Jones. Courtillot's response (published via a legal device activated where there is the possibility of threatening a libel suit) appeared in Le Monde today. I may give it a week or so for new developments to settle down before writing. For example, Foucart may get a chance to write a response in Le Monde.

There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending, etc. Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.

Roberta Lange and Private Property * It's especially troubling that the threats went beyond the hall. * Roberta Lang, the Nevada Democratic Chair, was simply performing her duty as Chair and has done nothing to deserve the disgusting attacks and death threats she has received over text, emails and over the phone. * The individuals launching these attacks \u2013 as well as the vandalism that took place over the weekend -- should be ashamed. We're Better Than Trump * Energy and passion for a candidate are absolutely welcome as part of this process. * The vast majority of Democrats who have already participated in our primary have done so appropriately -- with enthusiasm and civility. * For those who let their passion turn to rage when things don't go their way, well that's better left to the ugliness we've seen at Donald Trump's rallies, it doesn't belong on the Democratic side. The Rules of This Process are Not New * The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process have been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were agreed upon in 2014. * The system for determining these rules has been fair and transparent. * It is the same process that ultimately led to the nomination of Barack Obama in 2008, for example. * Shouting down any democratic process isn't just disruptive, it's unacceptable. We need to come together and be united. * If there are legitimate concerns from the supporters of either Democratic campaign, those concerns can, should and must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner. On concerns about the process * There is a process in place to address any concerns and both campaigns were equally represented in the credentials committee that was charged with resolving these disputes. But ultimately no matter what happened, there is no need to resort to violence. * The Democratic Party is a party of ideas and substance and the last thing we would want is for these frustrations to overshadow the important and substantive ideas our candidates have to offer. * We need for both campaigns and their supporters to understand that there is a process in place and that regardless of the outcome, violence should not be condoned.

{"text":"Hi Darrell et al - got a chance to read the paper and comments enroute to Atlanta. Here's some feedback.. General - comments are modest and should be easy to accommodate. That said, I think we have to take the comments of Rev 2 seriously. I'm guessing that its Francis Zwiers and in any case, he knows what he's talking about regarding stats. Also - IMPORTANT - I'd make sure we check and recheck every single calculation and dataset. This paper is going to get the attention of the skeptics and they are going to get all the data and work hard to show were we messed up. We don't want this - especially you, since it could take way more of your time than you'd like, and it'll look bad. VERY much worth the effort in advance. Ok Rev 1 - wow - never had it so good. Rev 2 General comment - we should take this one seriously. Get Caspar and Bette's help. The new synthesis could be telling us (especially when the outlier in Fig 4B is discounted - see below) that the Arctic is, in reality, more sensitive to changes in radiative forcing than reflected in the model. Are there other experiments or reasons to think this is true? If so, let's make this point and back it up with these other pieces of evidence. For example, does the CCSM get Arctic warming from the earl\/mid Holocene to present correctly? Does the model underestimate the Arctic change obs over the last 100 years. Since the reviewer raised this, you could add some refs and prose if needed to respond. Not a lot, but some. And, we need to respond one way or the other. Specific comments 1. agree, in the abstract, I suggest changing the sentence to read \"This trend likely reflects a steady orbitally-driven reduction in summer insolation, as confirmed by a 1000-year transient climate simulation.\" Note that this removes more than enough words to meet the eds requirement too. 2. for this one, I'd simply state that the forcing is stronger in the Arctic than at lower lats (double check how much) and also add what Giff suggested. 3. agree, make the suggested clarification 4. important (!) and hopefully easy. I leave to whomever did the calculation to make sure any serial correlation bias was taken into account. Make sure all p values are thus corrected. 5. ditto, makes sense too 6. clarify 7. this reviewer knows what he\/she is talking about - do what they suggest, and double check it's done well. 8. Don't delete the para. Instead point out that you've strengthened it and that it is important to place the new synthesis in a longer term Holocene context. It also clarifies to interdisciplinary readers why the Arctic is so sensitive (perhaps more sensitive than in models? - see above). That said, I would cite Kerwin et al 99 - I've attached it. It provides added detail and balance. Also, since you're responding to a reviewer comment and strengthening the ms, you can add the ref w\/o hassle (or so I'm guessing on recent experience). 9. yep, delete all \"attribution\"s in the ms. On p 6, lone 129, can say \"...support the connection between the Arctic summer cooling trend and a orbitally-driven reduction...\" 10) reviewer is correct - see my response above for the general comment, and see if you can work with his\/her ideas to improve. The outlier has to be just that?! Need an explanation before you can remove from any analysis, however. 11) makes sense - do it 12) yep - change text as suggested 13) agree, change p 7, line 153 to read \"...1980s appears to have been the single...\" 14) agree, change line 167 on p 8 to read \"...trend. Our new synthesis suggests that the most recent 10-year...\" Other suggested changes.... P. 3 line 69 - change region to read regional P 6 line 128 - \"(-2600 to -1600AD) isn't going to make sense to readers. Please provide some context - SOM or ?? P 7 line 145 - insert \"Arctic\" before \"summer\" P. 11 line 234 change to read \"...century. Ten-year means (bold lines) were used...\" Because you don't really say what the bold and unbold lines are - this will help the reader make sure they have it right. Fig 4 and caption - need to explain why the isolation axes are labeled differently - the numbers, and that both are still cover the same number of Wm-2. Didn't look at SOM, but make sure it's all bomber too, since there is a good chance it will get PICKED apart, and any errors thrown back in our face in a counter productive manner. Thanks! Nice job. Best, Peck (probably w\/o email for a while in the Amazon, although one never knows...)

The decision isn't final, but it looks like good news, with very reasonable revisions. Reviewer #1 had nothing substantial to suggest. Reviewer #2 was rather thorough. I think I can address his\/her suggestions but could use some help with three: (1) The reviewer challenged our assertion that, because climate change is amplified in the Arctic, the signal:noise ratio should be higher too. We don't have more than 1 sentence to expand on the assertion in the text. We could plead the case to editor and hope that it doesn't trip up the final acceptance, or we could omit it from the text. Suggestions? (2) The reviewer suggested that, if we are concerned about outliers influencing the mean values of the composite record, we should attempt a so-called \"robust\" regression procedure, such as median absolute deviation regression. Does anyone have experience with this? (3) The reviewer was concerned that we overestimated the strength of the relation between temperature and insolation in the long CCSM simulation. Namely s\/he criticized the leveraging effect of the one outlier in the model-generated insolation vs temperature plot (Fig. 4b), and suggested that we use 10-year means instead of 50 year.

{"text":"We got the list of names for Donald Trump the Democratic National Committee rejected By Philip Bump May 6 at 4:20 PM Apparently intentionally, Democrats have seized upon the nickname \"Dangerous Donald\" to refer to their general election opponent this November. Get it? Donald Trump is dangerous, so: Dangerous Donald. And, as everyone knows, the way to beat a bully is by trying to out-bully him, but not quite as well, and in a very dad-joke-y way. One of Trump's advantages in politics is that the things he says don't seem like they were workshopped to death, because they weren't, because he makes them up as he says them. Most politicians -- and most political communications -- go through all sorts of dumb testing and analysis and drafts and so on, until everything interesting (read: potentially negative to a voter) is leeched out, and all that's left is pre-breaded Chicken McNuggets.

The councils are putting up 2 million pounds per year for 5 years are NERC, EPSRC and ESRC. The research councils are putting the emphasis on \"solutions\" to climate change. They are clearly not looking for another version of CRU, the Hadley Centre, or any other existing centre in the UK. The focus is \"downstream\" of these existing centres. Much of what they appear to want we anticipated in our JIF ICER (Institute for Connective Environmental Sciences) bid and, indeed, we made a provisional early strike for the CCC in that bid, although the research councils' intentions were not known at that point. Even if the JIF ICER bid is unsuccessful (& at this stage we are still optimistic), then we will still be able to take advantage of this \"early\" thinking in the final CCC bid. We are aware of 3-4 competitors, which are mainly consortia of some form. Our consortium includes UMIST (number of departments), Southampton (number of departments), Cambridge (Dept of Econometrics), Sussex (Science Policy Research Unit), Cranfield (Ecotechnology Unit- Complex Systems Modelling), and Leeds (Institute for Transport Studies). There will also be a number of institutes associated with us, including Inst. Hydrology, BAS, Inst. Terrestrial Ecology, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Building Research Establishment, John Innes Centre, and possibly other Institutes such as the Plymouth Marine Lab & the Proudman Oceanographic Lab. The hub of this consortium will be UEA. Visiting fellows etc will work in the Centre (& possibly also at 'secondary' centres like UMIST). Business\/industry links are important, as are links with relevant institutes abroad. We anticipate writing in some industrial\/business partners. Our philosophy is not to seek to maximise the input of resources to UEA, or to the consortium, in the short term, but to build a Centre which has the credibility and the authority to identify, initiate, orchestrate research programmes, and to include the best people available. We see this as the likeliest way to attract long-term funding & to ensure the long-term future of the CCC. We have a fairly clear idea of the \"science framework\" of the CCC and, together with our partners, are now agreeing the \"research challenges\". At the moment the research challenges look something like this: 1. DEVELOPING THE TOOLKIT Given that the Centre's starting point is to take advantage of the best research internationally (extant, on-going, and planned), it will be necessary to apply, refine, and develop methods of 'integration'. Much science and engineering research is focused on specific disciplinary issues. This has to be brought together with critical analyses of social and economic factors, to design more adaptive and effective policies, and more effective and appropriate engineering\/technology. The best aspects of 'integrated assessments' will be applied with a UK focus. An important part of such assessments will be isolate emerging opportunities (for business\/industry) afforded by climate change - in order to identify competitive opportunities it will be necessary to consider global pressure points. Existing models need to be linked. Reduced complexity modelling has a significant role. The Toolkit can also be developed and tested via geographically-focused studies. For example, integrated coastal (incl. estuaries) management which will include: risk analysis; valuation of coastal environments; effects of adaptation (soft\/hard engineering solutions) on coastline; ecological\/economic models; etc. Methods to characterise\/measure vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The Toolkit will also include some of the consultation\/inclusion techniques outlined in UEA's JIF bid for ICER. 2. ABRUPT CHANGES AND EXTREMES 'Climate' research on abrupt\/non-linear changes (in 'underlying' climate) and on changes in extreme event frequency (some of the Tools will need to be applied - or adapted for - this Challenge: for example, vulnerability\/adaptation, risk analysis, reduced complexity modelling). Of particular importance is how the possibility of abupt\/non-linear change should be assimilated into decision-making frameworks (perception\/risk analyses, etc.). It will be necessary to consider the implications of non-climate 'shocks' - political and economic shocks; or combinations, for example, climate\/weather extremes influencing perceptions (amongst business community and politicians) leading to sudden shifts of policy, investments, etc. 3 CARBON MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY Adoption of clean technology (includes 'alternative' energy sources, and removal of C from emissions). In particular, clean technologies and solutions for developing countries link into identifying business opportunities. The impacts of clean technologies - landscape\/lifestyle valuation. Incorporation (technological) into existing infrastructure\/supply networks. a. Carbon 'sequestration' - options, waste C recycling, use in building materials, long-term storage, etc. Oceans. Ambitious bio-engineering? (discussions with Norwich's John Innes Centre on-going). b. Energy efficiency (technological), including control systems, especially when concentrated on one of the scale 'foci' (e.g. the household). 4. MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. Factor 4 and beyond 1. We will need to go well beyond Factor 4 to stabilise the climate system. This programme would analyse and assess different emission trajectories, and look at how we would in practice achieve Factor 4+. It would include assessment of tools such as: C trading, domestic tradeable carbon quotas, regulation and taxation, voluntary agreements, opportunities for win-win scenarios through resource use minimisation, etc. Also, it would look at changes to a low-C economy at different scales: households, SMEs, large firms, MNCs; local to regional to national to global, etc., to sectoral: transport, energy supply, heavy & light manufacturing, services & finance, etc. Techhnology uptake. This includes reducing transport emissions and exploring low-consumption (water, energy, carbon) households. What about air traffic? The research challenges above are not intended to be all-inclusive. We intend to use Research Challenges such as these 4, as \"examplars\" of the sort of thingw we will expand upon in the final bid. The research councils have emphasised the importance of attracting a top-rate international scientist as Research Director. They also wish us to name the Executive Director at this point. We believe it should be someone with a reputation in climate research in their own right, good links etc with the \"impacts\" people and with funders, as well as being a good manager\/organiser. We anticipate naming Mike Hulme. From what we have heard, that will give us an additional advantage over other bids. At this point, we will welcome your comment, input, suggestions.

IN THE NEWS Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8 Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13. California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand. ''I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy). The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented: - Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, - Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry - All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections. The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start. However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets. \"This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,\" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team. \"We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.\" GasMarktFax Stirs \"Trouble\" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market: European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October. The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers. \"Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,\" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative. \"However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position. Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,\" Helge-Jurgen added. Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement. The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland. The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule. \"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,\" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland. \"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,\" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office. A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.\" EBS Celebrates Neos Deal Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity. Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: \"We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.\" Launch of Nordic precipitation index In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations. The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity. Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers. The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions. For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall. The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden). On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region. Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh\/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh\/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market. In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years). The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!\" \"What are you going to do with them?\" Jesus asked. Satan replied, \"Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!\" \"And what will you do when you get done with them?\" Jesus asked. \"Oh, I'll kill 'em,\" Satan glared proudly. \"How much do you want for them?\" Jesus asked. \"Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill you!! You don't want those people!!\" \"How much?\" Jesus asked again. Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, \"All your tears, and all your blood.\" Jesus said, \"DONE!\" Then He paid the price. Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. Isn't it funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says. Or is it scary? Isn't it funny how someone can say \"I believe in God\" but still follow Satan (who, by the way also \"believes\" in God). Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and workplace. Isn't it funny how someone can be! so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week. Are you laughing? Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them. Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me. Will YOU pass this on? I did","label":0}

{"text":"Please hold off. They have more edits coming. From: Jefferson, Deshundra Sent: Thursday, April 28, 2016 4:55 PM To: Miranda, Luis; Walker, Eric; Paustenbach, Mark; Walsh, Tom Subject: Please read: My Vote, My Voice Below is a LTE that I am submitting to The News & Observer on behalf of North Carolina's Democratic Congressional delegation. We are limited to 500 words. North Carolina had one of the strongest rates of voter participation in the nation before H.B. 589 was signed into law. The law rolled back the early voting period, eliminated same-day registration, and imposed restrictive photo ID requirements. While we are disappointed the U.S. District Court upheld H.B. 589, we are hopeful the courts and the American people will ultimately see these laws for what they truly are - a cynical political ploy to make it harder for women, people of color, students, the elderly and working families to cast a ballot. These groups of voters are the majority of Americans and represent the Democrat's core constituency. When we limit the ways that people can vote, we are hurting the low-wage workers with two jobs, the single mother who goes to work early each morning and picks up her children late at night, and the elderly widower without a car who relies on his adult children to get to the polls. This purely partisan law was passed without any support from Democrats because its intent was clear from the very beginning - to systematically limit access to the polls in order to sway elections. Tellingly, the General Assembly waited until the U.S. Supreme Court had eliminated the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act before advancing these discriminatory voter-suppression measures. At the time this bill was passed, the North Carolina State Board of Elections identified only two instances of potential voter impersonation in a 14-year period. Senator Thom Tillis, then-North Carolina House Speaker, even acknowledged in an interview that fighting so-called voter fraud was not the primary reason for passing the bill. Sadly, several other states have joined North Carolina in making it harder to cast a vote. In April, students at a Marquette University polling station in Wisconsin faced two-hour wait times just to cast a ballot. After the polls officially closed, a Wisconsin Republican Congressman bragged to a TV reporter that the state's restrictive photo ID law would help the GOP defeat Democrats in the fall. In Texas, Senator Ted Cruz recently filed an amicus brief in support of the state's restrictive photo ID law. He also led the fight as Texas Solicitor General to limit voter registration efforts in communities of color, vigorously defending a discriminatory law against a civil rights lawsuit. While Democrats have gone to court in Arizona to reverse this culture of discrimination and disenfranchisement, Republicans are going to court to defend laws designed to decrease voter turnout because they believe that when fewer people vote, they have a better chance of winning. Make no mistake, this is part of a consistent and concerted effort by Republicans to silence voters who do not agree with their agenda. We expect that these laws, like the one passed here in North Carolina, will ultimately be declared unconstitutional, and will continue the fight at the Congressional level to restore the critical protections of the Voting Rights Act. -- CBC Chairman Representative G.K.

I'm skeptical. One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction is more \"real\" than the reality. You see it over and over again in history: The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive People are compelled to perpetuate. Worse, even when there is substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction that is already firmly entrenched. And many peoples (e.g. American Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth in popular culture. I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where you are on the planet. The only time you see any anomalies is when you have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com","label":0}

{"text":"Hi Keith - Happy new year. Hopefully, you had a good holiday. I've had a chance to read your section and hopefully you've had a chance to read what I sent just before the holidays. The purpose of this email is to help get a focus on the finish line (just a few days away) and to get a dialog going that will hopefully help you finish section 6.3.2.1. If you'd like to talk on the phone, just let me know. Please see my email from right before xmas holidays for original comments. Plus, here are the new ones from both me and David Rind: 0) as leader of this KEY section, we need you to take the lead integrating everything you think should be integrated, editing and boiling it down to just ca 4 pages of final text (e.g., 8 pages of typed text plus figs). This means cutting some material (e.g., forcings and simulations) and perhaps moving glacier record (MUCH boiled down) to a box. See below. 00) note that we can also perhaps move some of the details to the appendix (although we won't write this until after the current ZOD crunch, save an outline of what you might want in there). 1) I like your figure ideas, with the comments: 1a) I don't think you need figure 1d - the SH recons are sketchy since not much data, and it might be better to just discuss in a sentence or three. Any space saved is good too. Not sure about your proposed 1e - have to see it, I guess. 1b) Figure 2 looks interesting. I'm trying to get the latest Arctic recon from Konrad Hughen - it is quite robust and a significant multi-proxy update. Should be published in time, though not sure thing since he's still hot on including his (our) AO recon which is more sketchy 1c) I think we can save space and improve organization if we DO NOT include Fig 3. However, this is open for debate - see David's comments below. 2) I agree with David's comments in general - so see them below. The prickly issue is where to put the forcings and simulated changes. I am close to having the prose from the radiation chapter, including the latest Lean and Co's view on solar - this will make many of the existing simulations involving inferred past solar forcing suspect (I will send in a day or so I hope). This means that we might be best saving space and downplaying this work some. I'm not sure, but wanted to debate it with you. Also, Chap 9 will have simulations in spades, so we can save space by letting them do it. Also, as David points out, we can focus on it elsewhere in our chapter more concisely - leaving you to focus on the VERY important obs record of temp and other changes. Can you tell, I'm still not 100% sure? I'll send another email to you and others about this in a bit. 3) Your section is too long and needs to be condensed. Thus, you need to think through what's most important and what's less so. For example, we need to figure out how to condense the glacier record of change. David thinks it should be a separate section that cuts across time scales (i.e., Holocene and last 2000 years). Perhaps we should try to make it into a box - 3 to 5 short paragraphs and a figure or two. Either way we have to really wack it. What do you think - you and I should be on the same page with Eystein before discussing w\/ Olga perhaps. Or you can discuss with her - you're the lead on this section. 4) you're doing an impressive job! Lots to keep track of. Next, here is what David has offered. Take it all with a grain of salt, but I have read it and he has many good points. On the structural or any other points, I'm happy to discuss on the phone, or you can just debate with him and me on email. ******* From David Rind 1\/4\/05 **************** 6.3 Understanding Past Climate System Change (forcing and response) 6.3.1 Introduction (0.5 pages) 6.3.2 The Current Interglacial 6.3.2.1 Last 2000 years (4 pages) Figure 1 should be of the last 2000 years, with appropriate caveats, not just since 1860 (which will undoubtedly be in other chapters). pp. 8-18: The biggest problem with what appears here is in the handling of the greater variability found in some reconstructions, and the whole discussion of the 'hockey stick'. The tone is defensive, and worse, it both minimizes and avoids the problems. We should clearly say (e.g., page 12 middle paragraph) that there are substantial uncertainties that remain concerning the degree of variability - warming prior to 12K BP, and cooling during the LIA, due primarily to the use of paleo-indicators of uncertain applicability, and the lack of global (especially tropical) data. Attempting to avoid such statements will just cause more problems. In addition, some of the comments are probably wrong - the warm-season bias (p.12) should if anything produce less variability, since warm seasons (at least in GCMs) feature smaller climate changes than cold seasons. The discussion of uncertainties in tree ring reconstructions should be direct, not referred to other references - it's important for this document. How the long-term growth is factored in\/out should be mentioned as a prime problem. The lack of tropical data - a few corals prior to 1700 - has got to be discussed. The primary criticism of McIntyre and McKitrick, which has gotten a lot of play on the Internet, is that Mann et al. transformed each tree ring prior to calculating PCs by subtracting the 1902-1980 mean, rather than using the length of the full time series (e.g., 1400-1980), as is generally done. M&M claim that when they used that procedure with a red noise spectrum, it always resulted in a 'hockey stick'. Is this true? If so, it constitutes a devastating criticism of the approach; if not, it should be refuted. While IPCC cannot be expected to respond to every criticism a priori, this one has gotten such publicity it would be foolhardy to avoid it. In addition, there are other valid criticisms to the PC approach. Assuming that the PC structure stays the same was acknowledged in the Mann et al paper as somewhat risky, given the possibility of altered climate forcing (e.g., solar). Attempting to reconstruct tropical temperatures using high latitude PCs assumes that the PCs are influenced only by global scale processes. In a paper we now have in review in JGR, and in other papers already published, it is shown that high latitude climate changes can directly affect the local expression of the modes of variability (NAO in particular). So attempting to fill in data at other locations from PCs that could have local influences may not work well; at the least, it has large uncertainties associated with it. The section from p.18-20 - simulations of temperature change over the last millennium , including regional expressions - should not be in this section. It is covered in the modeling section (several different times), and will undoubtedly be in other chapters as well. And the first paragraph on p. 19 is not right - only by using different forcings have models been able to get similar responses (which does not constitute good agreement). The discussion in the first paragraph of p. 20 is not right - the dynamic response is almost entirely in winter, which would not have affected the 'warm season bias' paleoreconstructions used to prove it. It also conflicts with ocean data (Gerard Bond, personal communication). Anyway, it's part of the section that should be dropped. pp. 20-28: The glacial variations should be summarized in a coherentglobal picture. Variations as a function of time should be noted - not just lumped together between 1400 and 1850 - for example, it should be noted where glaciers advanced during the 17th century and retreated during the 19th century, for that is important in understanding possible causes for the Little Ice Age (as well as the validity of the 'hockey stick'). The discussion on the bottom of p.25-27 as to the causes of the variations is inappropriate and should be dropped - note if solar forcing is suspect, every paragraph that relates observed changes to solar forcing will be equally suspect (e.g., see also p. 44, first paragraph). Bottom of p. 27: Greene et al. (GRL, 26, 1909-1912, 1999) did an analysis of 52 glaciated areas from 30-60N and found that the highest correlation between their ELA variations in the last 40 years was with summer season freezing height and winter season precip. The warm season freezing height was by far more important. Therefore, the relationship of glacier variations to NAO changes (which are important only in winter), as discussed in this paragraph, while perhaps valid for a period of time in southern Norway, is not generally applicable. p. 34-36 on forcings: note that this is redundant to what is discussed in several later sections (e.g., 6.5.2); and other chapters), and that is true of forcing in general for the whole of section 6.2. I would strongly suggest dropping forcing from section 6.3.2.1, at least, and perhaps giving it its own number, or referring to othersubsections for it. It has a different flavor from the responses, and the section is already very big. Forcing does need to be discussed in the paleoclimate chapter, for reasons of climate sensitivity and explaining observations, but that is what Chapter 6.5 is about. (In summary - 6.3.2.1 already is taking on one controversy - paleotemperatures, which is needs to do better, It should not have to deal with the forcing problems as well, and especially not in an off-handed way.) Specific comments: p. 36: 6 ppm corresponds to a temperature response of 0.3 to 0.6\u00b0K using the IPCC sensitivity range. p. 36, last paragraph: one could equally well conclude that the reconstructions are showing temperature changes that are too small. This is the essence of the problem with the last 2000 years: if the reconstructions are right, either there was no solar forcing, or climate sensitivity is very low. If the real world had more variability, either there was solar forcing, or climate sensitivity is high (as is internal variability). I've tried to say this in the climate sensitivity sub-chapter. pp. 37-41: obviously a lot of overlap, but it shouldn't be hard to combine these. p. 39, first paragraph: but can the models fully explain what is thought to have happened? Quantification is important here, because many of the same climate\/veg models are being used to assess future changes in vegetation. p. 42 - first full paragraph: what are the implications of the methane drop without a CO2 drop? p. 43, middle paragraph: obviously should mention solar-orbital forcing in this paragraph. p. 44, first paragraph: again, assuming a solar forcing p. 45, first paragraph: overlap with pp. 20-28. Second paragraph: overlap with p.39, last full paragraph p. 52 - repeat of p. 43. ******* END From David Rind 1\/4\/05 **************** Thanks! Cheers, peck -- Jonathan T.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. \"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,\" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's. By Jonathan Stempel 10\/29\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies. That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. \"Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,\" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. \"A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year.\" Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a \"lagging\" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or \"junk\"-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. \"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,\" he said. \"That is a positive for credit quality.\" The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1) 2001-10-29 12:16 (New York) Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1) (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.) Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said. ''Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ''It's likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.'' Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading partners. The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper, or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity. ''Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc. ''I think their interest rates for loans would go up.'' Sells Assets for Cash Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and putting up assets as collateral. Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and sales proceeds. The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural Gas Co. next year. Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to $14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12 percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors Service after it wrote down the value of its assets. The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months. --Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom, 609-750-4651 USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts. 10\/29\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995. Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. \"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,\" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.

Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence.

All Rights Reserved. POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus By Mark Golden 10\/29\/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks. Why the talk of a \"death spiral\" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or \"shareholders' equity,\" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. Long-Running Concerns A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. \"Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,\" Wasden said. Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. \"We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,\" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. \"This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point.\" Keeping Talent A Challenge Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for \"personal reasons.\" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO.\" That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? \"I don't know anybody who said that,\" Wasden said. \"What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?\" Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. \"Enron has been a cult, more than a company,\" he said. \"Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside.\" Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. \"There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,\" he said. That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's 10\/29\/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd (Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments. The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties. aw\/gc For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to \"Baa2\" from \"Baa1,\" and said it may cut Enron's \"Prime-2\" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion. Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered \"difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,\" Moody's said. Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to \"negative\" from \"stable.\" Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries. By Stuart Penson 10\/29\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said. \"I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,\" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. \"They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,\" he said. \"The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis.\" A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. \"We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),\" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. \"Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,\" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband By Michael Rieke 10\/29\/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Dow Jones Newswires Column HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money. But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow \"purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,\" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? \"I think if is too early to tell,\" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. \"As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron.\" It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. \"At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions.\" Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. \"Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,\" he said. \"This is a big case, by any means.\" -By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In July 2001. As Cash? All available gas on the system is sold and converted into cash, UAF gains increase the available gas on the system. Or it is used for some other system balancing purpose. (i.e. imbalance, line pack). What is the period of time imbalances can be disputed? TWs imbalances are on OBAs which are not governed by the six month GISB standard but the OBA contract terms. TW is always at risk for measurement adjustments. TW is also at risk for customers who dispute the valuation of their OBA contracts. TW and El Paso agreed to a measurement adjustment last year going back 3-5 years which caused a $5 million gain. Why is this gain deemed real while the others have not? I have provided two reasons to management not to reserve the July gain. First, field reports indicate that in the first 10 days of July a receipt value was leaking unmeter gas into TWs system and that leak has no recourse against TW. Second, TW already has a $4.3 million reserve for undefined measurement adjustments. -----Original Message----- From: Saunders, James Sent: Thursday, August 30, 2001 8:00 AM To: Fancler, Dan; Geaccone, Tracy Cc: Walton, Mark; Harris, Steven Subject: RE: 0701 UAF Gain When was it recovered?

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect.

{"text":"FW: CHAPPIE\/PIXELS\/HOTEL T 2 (Japan) Stephen, My thoughts: Chappie: 2 issues: I agree, this is one I would favor softer dates over better but more competitive release periods. Second, slight chance the film will move so let the team know that so they know this can happen. Hotel T: Given the big miss on Cloudy 2, good chance we will NRP this so no commitments we can't back out of. We missed our estimate on Hotel T and on Cloudy 2. Pixels: I don't have Dick in for as big an estimate as he does. Dated films don't look so bad as competition but ask Dick what else could get dated around this time. We have the old Japanese games and a set piece in Tokyo, but tailoring to Japan (ex. Wolverine) doesn't seem to have helped other films.

We had a meeting with SMT to talk about a release date of CHAPPIE \/ PIXELS\/ HOTEL T 2. Re:CHAPPIE Case 1 We would like to release it from May 16th ,2015. However ,WB has already offered FOCUS at the same period. We asked SMT to persuade WB into changing the release date of FOCUS and we are just waiting for their reply now. The reason why we want to release it from May 16th is because we should not go with Avengers 2 or Fast & Furious 7. Please see the competitors release date as follows; The Man From U.N.C.L.E. April 18 Avengers 2 April 25 Secret Service May 22 Fast & Furious 7 June 6 or 13 We don't have much information about domestic movies at the present.

Re:PIXELS We have reached an agreement on our release date with SMT. From September 19(Sat) There are five consecutive holidays. 2015 Calendar Sep 19 (Sat) Sep 20 (Sun) Sep 21 (National holiday) Sep 22 (National holiday) Sep 23 (National holiday) San Andreas Sep 11 Ant-Man Sep 19 Silence Sep 19 Passengers Sep 19 Many distributors aim at the same date , however, PIXELS is our tent-pole movie so we want to release it from that day. We have been informed that the release date in US is May 15 or mid July. That is good for us because we will have enough time to promote it and we can attach its trailer on summer big movies. Re : HOTEL T 2 We were planning to release it from Sep 19. But due to PIXELS releasing, our tentative release date is Oct.10. It is not the holiday season and there are only 2 national holidays in four weeks. The final box office of the previous one was 138 M JPY so we should be careful spending money on HOTEL T 2. Just between us, due to the result of the previous one, exhibitors' expectations of HOTEL T 2 are not high at the moment. We would like to discuss with you sometime next week.

This is often because webmasters do not have the ability or time to design and create unique websites. These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design for your website. 1. Navigation System Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first things to consider when designing your website. Visitors usually look for a way to get to the information they want before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase ( for example. There is a list of categories on the left, and information about the network on the top bar. It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the bottom of the page because: - People see the top of the page first - If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor. 2. Color Scheme When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some colors that are often used are white on black or black on white. A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer ( created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles ( Tucows ( or Download.com ( for \"color schemer.\" 3. Content Window This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand. Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write your own content, it sure is worth it. To find content for your website, try searching at EzineArticles ( Other people may have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content from other authors, as mentioned above. 4. Font(s) Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New. Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.) Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be used for long pieces of text. The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs, or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times (Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif, is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it easier to read. 5. Advertising Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing that almost every website has. The most common type is what is known as \"banner\" advertising. It is called that because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high. New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new style called \"skyscraper\" -- so called for a reason: it looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too wide (about 100-125 pixels.) Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page. Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side. Conclusion These are only five things to consider when designing a website. There are many others however. Let me know what you find that helps you create a unique website.

The Douglass et al. paper claims (and purports to show) that collinearity between ENSO, volcanic, and solar predictor variables is not a serious problem in studies attempting to estimate the effects of these factors on MSU tropospheric temperatures. Their work has serious scientific flaws - it confuses forcing and response, and ignores strong temporal autcorrelation in the individual predictor variables, incorrectly assuming independence of individual monthly means in the MSU 2LT data. In the Douglass et al. view of the world, uncertainties in predictor variables, observations, etc. are non-existent. The error bars on their estimated ENSO, volcano, and solar regression coefficients are miniscule. Over a year ago, Tom and I reviewed (for JGR) a paper by Douglass et al. that was virtually identical to the version that has now appeared in Climate Research. We rejected it. Prior to this, both Tom and I had engaged in a long and frustrating dialogue with Douglass, in which we attempted to explain to him that there are large uncertainties in the deconvolution of ENSO, volcano, and solar signals in short MSU records. Douglass chose to ignore all of the comments we made in this exchange, as he later ignored all of the comments we made in our reviews of his rejected JGR paper. Although the Douglass et al. Climate Research paper is largely a criticism of our previously-published JGR paper, neither Tom nor I were asked to review the paper for Climate Research. Nor were any other coauthors of the Santer et al. JGR paper asked to review the Douglass et al. manuscript. I'm assuming that Douglass specifically requested that neither Tom nor I should be allowed to act as reviwers of his Climate Research paper. It would be interesting to see his cover letter to the journal. In the editorial that you forwarded, Dr. Kinne writes the following: \"If someone wishes to criticise a published paper s\/he must present facts and arguments and give criticised parties a chance to defend their position.\" The irony here is that in our own experience, the \"criticised parties\" (i.e., Tom and I) were NOT allowed to defend their positions. Based on Kinne's editorial, I see little hope for more enlightened editorial decision making at Climate Research. Tom, Richard Smith and I will eventually publish a rebuttal to the Douglass et al. paper. We'll publish this rebuttal in JGR - not in Climate Research.

Then, we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough, and, we'll be more content when they are. After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will, certainly, be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete, when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, we are able to go on a nice vacation, or, when we retire. The truth is, there's no better time to be happy, than right now. If not now, when? Your life will, always, be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy, anyway. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more, because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with... and, remember, that time waits for no one. So, stop waiting.... - until your car or home is paid off - until you get a new car or home - until your kids leave the house - until you go back to school - until you finish school - until you lose 10 pounds - until you gain 10 pounds - until you get married - until you get a divorce - until you have kids - until you retire - until summer - until spring - until winter - until fall - until you die There is no better time, than right now, to be happy. Happiness is a journey, not a destination. So, work like you don't need money, Love like you've never been hurt, And dance like no one's watching. ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and\/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

My >defragmentor keeps starting over and over and my scan >disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be. Hello Nicety, I have to agree with Jim Shofstall,  when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441: One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit. When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I have to make it do anything useful. If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE download called FreeMem which you can get here; This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be running at peak performance all the time and much easier than constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to search for. HTH.

Comments on Site #141:  Carol Hall carol@floridarental.co.uk ~~~~ Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to make your front page navigation a little less confusing? The \"next page\" tab is right next to one that says \"bookmark this page\" - no information until you mouseover the tab to tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not enough information on your openning page. ~~~~ I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL ending with .uk. Recommendations for this site. 1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the animation and red text on the yellow background, missing the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more details to this important introduction. Instead of using the 'click here' button, just have a text link following directly after the introduction. 2. On the second page, have all your links the same color, and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially when it is in the normal blue link color. Having the important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill. 3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed menu and the pages are all untitled. I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you want the best site you can have and I think these changes will make a world of difference. Once a person gets into the site you have the information organized and complete. I even wanted to come and stay! ~~~~ The animations make this site look amateurish from the beginning. The flashing \"Bookmark This Site\" makes me want to leave instead of come back! The font Comic Sans MS also looks very kiddy. Much could be done to improve this site. ~~~~ I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should have been up by the text and that is where I should go. On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs. Other than that, the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page. The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good. Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten that far. ~~~~ This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich. Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste, but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that form a background for some images. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel: Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting: MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to: mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to: mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

{"text":"Dear coauthors of the Santer et al. International Journal of Climatology paper (and other interested parties), I have now publicly released the synthetic MSU tropical lower tropospheric temperatures that were the subject of Mr. Stephen McIntyre's request to the U.S. Dept. of Energy\/National Nuclear Security Agency under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I have also released additional synthetic MSU temperatures which were not requested by Mr. McIntyre. These synthetic MSU datasets are available on PCMDI's publicly-accessible website. The link to the datasets is: Technical information about the synthetic MSU datasets is provided in a document entitled: \"Information regarding synthetic Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) temperatures calculated from CMIP-3 archive\" The link to the technical document is: I hope that these datasets will prove useful for bona fide scientific research, and will be employed for such purposes only. I am also hopeful that after publication of these datasets, I will be able to return to full-time research, unencumbered by further FOIA requests from Mr. McIntyre. In my opinion, Mr. McIntyre's FOIA requests are for the purpose of harassing Government scientists, and not for the purpose of improving our understanding of the nature and causes of climate change. I'd like to thank Dave Bader, Bill Goldstein, and Pat Berge for helping me complete the process of reviewing, releasing, and publishing the synthetic MSU datasets and the technical document.

{"text":"From: Hillary For America Press Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 3:29 PM To: Hillary for America Press Subject: Trump Rebukes Top Ally Amid Ongoing Push For Warmer Relations With Putin, Russia Trump Rebukes Top Ally Amid Ongoing Push For Warmer Relations With Putin, Russia Nobody is better at proving that Donald Trump's foreign policy would be disastrous than Donald Trump himself. With one short interview on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Trump set off a media firestorm in the UK, stoking fears about the potential fraying of our decades-long special relationship, and what that would mean for the UK's national security and standing in the world: On Prime Minister David Cameron: \"It looks like we are not going to have a very good relationship. Who knows.\" On London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who called his Muslim ban ignorant: \"Let's take an I.Q. test.... I don't care about him... I think they're very rude statements, and frankly, tell him, I will remember those statements.\" On the European Union: \"In terms of Britain, I would say, what do you need it for?\" Trump continues to demonstrate that his reckless, shoot-from-the-hip approach to foreign policy would make the country and the world far less safe. He casts aside our most important allies when their leaders criticize his dangerous proposals, and heaps praise on our adversaries if they say a kind word about him. Most notably, Trump continues to express his admiration for Vladimir Putin, pushing for warmer relations with Russia: Donald Trump, 5\/7\/16 : \"When people like me, I like them \u2014 even Putin. ... And by the way, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia?\" Brookings Institution's Thomas Wright : \"So Trump is now on the record saying he expects to have a good relationship with Russia and a bad relationship with the UK.\" Simply put, this is not a man who has the temperament or the steady hand to be our commander-in-chief. Check out the reaction in the UK to Trump's alarming comments about our ally, as well as the latest updates on his love affair with Putin below. Reaction to Trump's UK comments: Tony Blair's Director of Political Operations, John McTernan : Donald Trump might kill the 'special relationship'. That's no laughing matter for Britain \"So, the first casualty of a Trump presidency would be the specialness of the special relationship.... at a very deep level, ours is a defence relationship with the United States. The shared language, history and values are important, but the nuts and bolts are the inter-operability of equipment and the joint deployment of forces. And at the very heart lies the Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA) - over 50 years of co-operation on nuclear weapons.... there is no doubt that Trump is not just a threat to the special relationship \u2013 he would be the end of it. It would not just be the fractious personal relationship \u2013 there is no conceivable British prime minister who would be able to fake respect for Trump's intellect and strategic insight. It is, fundamentally, what a Trump victory would mean: a triumph for nativism and isolationism.... President Trump would change everything. It is no laughing matter for us.\" ITV : Trump warns of poor relationship with Cameron over PM's refusal to withdraw 'divisive, stupid and wrong' comment \"Donald Trump has issued a warning to David Cameron that the two may not have a good relationship if Mr Trump becomes the next US president. The US Republican presidential hopeful was responding to comments Mr Cameron made last year over Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. The prime minister called the idea 'divisive, stupid and wrong' and his since refused to withdraw those comments.\" Financial Times : What would Donald Trump mean for the US-UK special relationship? \"Donald Trump has done it again. Just as it appeared that he was toning down some of his extreme views and becoming a more conventional Republican presidential candidate, he has lobbed a missile at David Cameron.... All told, it is hard to find a mainstream British politician who has anything but a negative view of Mr Trump... This is not, of course, merely a UK issue. South Korea and Japan are among those Asian countries concerned about what Mr Trump would mean for their foreign policies. European leaders are worried that he will continue to stoke populist, anti-Muslim sentiments. If Mr Trump visits these shores in a political capacity, it seems certain that he will not be welcomed with open arms.\" BBC : Donald Trump challenges Sadiq Khan to IQ test \"Donald Trump has challenged the new London mayor to an IQ test after Sadiq Khan said he was ignorant. Mr Khan was responding to Mr Trump's stance on Muslims that they should banned from entering America. Speaking in an interview with Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain, he also warned he may not have a 'very good relationship' with UK Prime Minister David Cameron if he wins the US presidency.\" Telegraph : Donald Trump warns of 'not very good relationship' with David Cameron after he called him stupid for Muslim ban proposal \"Donald Trump has warned that he may not have a 'very good relationship' with David Cameron after the Prime Minister branded his proposal to ban Muslims from the US as 'stupid'. The presidential hopeful also sniped at new London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling him 'ignorant' for comments he made after being elected and warning him: 'I will remember those statements.'\" Euronews : US-UK 'not going to have a very good relationship', Trump warns Cameron The 'special relationship' between the US and the UK could be on rocky ground, if Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump takes office in November. British Prime Minister David Cameron has refused to retract a comment labelling the property tycoon's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US \"stupid, divisive and wrong.\" The Guardian : Trump's foreign policy tirade turns to David Cameron \"The presumptive Republican candidate is fighting back after a weekend taking heat over his attitude toward women. In doing so, he picked a fight with the British prime minister, David Cameron, and new London mayor Sadiq Khan.\" Daily Express : Donald Trump on Cameron: 'we are not going to have a very good relationship' \"The billionaire Republican candidate was responding to comments the prime minister made last year after Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. The presidential hopeful also sniped at new London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling him 'ignorant' for comments he made after being elected, and warned him: 'I will remember those statements.'\" Reuters : Trump says unlikely to have good relationship with UK's Cameron \"Donald Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with David Cameron because the British prime minister cast the U.S. presidential candidate as 'divisive, stupid and wrong' for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.... Cameron's spokesman said the prime minister stood by his original comments. The United States is Britain's closest ally. U.S. companies are the biggest foreign direct investors in Britain and the so- called 'special relationship' with Washington has been the cornerstone of British diplomacy since World War Two. Trump's often controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris and other European capitals.\" Sky News : Cameron Stands By Trump 'Stupid' Comments \"When asked whether Mr Cameron was concerned about Mr Trump's suggestion, a Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister has made his views on Donald Trump's comments very clear. He disagrees with them, and I haven't got anything further to add. He continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the US is divisive, stupid and wrong.' The spokesman added that the PM was 'committed to maintaining the special relationship' whoever wins the presidential election in November.\" AP (London) : Trump says he expects poor relationship with UK leader \"U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump says he may have a poor relationship with Prime Minister David Cameron in light of the British leader's criticism of Trump's call for all Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the United States.... Cameron has refused to retract comments describing Trump's proposed Muslim ban as \"divisive, stupid and wrong.\"\" Ongoing scrutiny over Trump's love affair with Putin: Wall Street Journal, 5\/13\/16 : Donald Trump Goes His Own Way With Vladimir Putin: Warm words and push to improve ties with Moscow aren't shared by Barack Obama, Republican presidential rivals \"But in no area has he been more persistent\u2014and perhaps more consistent\u2014than his call to improve relations with Mr. Putin, an authoritarian figure often at odds with the U.S. Mr. Trump's views on Mr. Putin separate him not just from Mr. Obama but from his former GOP rivals, and from conservatives as well as liberals. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) called Mr. Putin a 'gangster and a thug,' and Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton has termed him a bully, while Mr. Trump calls him 'very bright' and a 'strong leader.'\" Washington Post, 5\/13\/16 : The Putin-Trump kiss being shared around the world \"Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump are kissing on the side of a barbecue restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania. The mural, painted by local artist Mindaugas Bonanu, was unveiled by the co-owner of the Keule Ruke, Dominykas \u010ce\u010dkauskas, on Thursday. It has swiftly gained attention in both Lithuanian and international media.... Putin and Trump are known for exchanging mutual admiration statements, with the Russian leader calling Trump 'a very colorful person, talented without any doubt' and Trump saying it was 'a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.'\" Politico, 5\/15\/16 : When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow: How a 2013 beauty pageant explains Trump's love for Russia and obsession with Vladimir Putin. On June 18, 2013, Donald Trump had some exciting news: He would soon be whisking dozens of the world's most beautiful women to Russia. \"The Miss Universe Pageant will be broadcast live from MOSCOW, RUSSIA on November 9th,\" Trump tweeted that day, referring to the beauty pageant he owned at the time. \"A big deal that will bring our countries together!\" And maybe not just the countries, Trump said: \"Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant,\" he tweeted later that day. \"[I]f so, will he become my new best friend?\" Now that he's headed for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump talks often about establishing warmer relations with Vladimir Putin. That's a sharp break from the Washington establishment consensus for punishing Russia's president over his policies in Ukraine and Syria. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, 5\/15\/16 : \"Well, I have some real issues with things he said about national security policy and some concerns... I worry a little bit about his admiration for Vladimir Putin.\" ### For Immediate Release, May 16, 2016 Contact: press@hillaryclinton.com PAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA Contributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.

Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the Internet was the Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your software--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for free. Now, even Yahoo is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client. But if you look closely enough, you can still find some worthwhile free apps. We've reviewed four free e-mailers to get you started. And we've also taken a peek at the new BearShare, which is not only free itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no cost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is another matter entirely. Intel's new insides: one size fits all?The i845 chipset's many flavors are faster, better, and a lot more confusing.

So-called free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as before. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another look at so-called \"free\" e-mailers. Get the gear you need to burn DVDs DVD authoring is one of the hottest new hobbies around, but picking out the right equipment can be a daunting task. We've broken down the process and selected the best gear for the job, from camera to software, burner to DVD player. BearShare 4.0 The latest version of this oft-overlooked Gnutella client lets you pay $19.95 for ad-free file sharing and offers a nice, clean interface and a chat client to boot. Plus, BearShare lets you opt out of bundled adware and spyware when you install it. Should you run to this app like a bear to honey? Not yet. We'll tell you why. Read the review | Manufacturer price Yahoo Mail After months of beta testing and pricing adjustments (that's right, Yahoo now charges for some services), the new Yahoo Mail just hit the Web. Among its changes are a complete redesign, better Calendar and Address Book integration, and a new color palette. Find out if Yahoo still deserves your account.

As a result, Peachtree Complete 2003 has all the basics, including inventory control, time billing, and payroll management.

Now, the company has released a new \"lite\" ICQ that sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at what cost? We take a first look. SBC Yahoo Dial Thanks to a partnership with SBC Pacific Bell, Yahoo is now in the dial-up game. The new service, known as SBC Yahoo Dial, offers a customized browser, 25MB of storage, and 11 e-mail addresses--all for $21.95 or lower, depending on your SBC service package. Our reviewer investigates. Read the review First Take: Winamp3 Release Candidate We've been waiting aeons for the newest version of popular media player Winamp. We haven't received a full new version yet, but AOL has partially obliged with a prerelease version. Winamp3 Release Candidate serves up a new interface and some major underlying changes. But does the new look muddy up Winamp's legendary ease of use? Inside @ccess: Is your ISP safe from hackers?

I would like to use Windows Media >Player instead. --Wicked Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s) from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have QuickTime set as your default media player for all media files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date, whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select Edit > Preferences > QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled \"Check for updates automatically.\" If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player, open that program, click Tools > Options. Select the Formats tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that you want Windows Media Player to open. To make sure that QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those file types within QuickTime.

{"text":"You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my health. During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In the end all I had to do to \"earn\" was send a few emails to my targeted databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands people on the Web. Each one made me money. Consider me as one of those illusive \"top earners\" that you hear about but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers with a \"bang\". I have also been engaged to create and deploy aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top earning amounts that other \"top earners\" and I have earned and in a very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my databases. All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable very active people to market any m'l'm\/network mktg\/other similar program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into your business providing you mention my company name to then when promoting your business. You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote or learn \"how to do\" anything ever again. This will definitely revolutionise the way you work and make you succeed. I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500 people and will only honour that number of orders. This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of. I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information plus my telephone number so you can call me direct. Please send an email to: 0l1v3r@isp-q.com with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you additional details to include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my contact telephone number to call me on. If you get a problem emailing me or a bounceback please call 00.44-781-805-4683 or from the USA use 00.144 instead. If you think I have breached your privacy and you would like to request me to cancel any other newsletter or correspondence to you, please send me an email to: fr3ddi@isp-q.com and it will cease from 48 hours. Put @cease@ in the subject line.","label":1}

By getting clear on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be moving toward and experiencing your highest and best. 1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will have even more to appreciate. 2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly imagine. 3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals. 4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more calories. Eat only small amounts at one time. 5. Read something educational, inspirational or entertaining--preferably all three. 6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the Super-conscious. 7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy. 8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of my book, then write in my journal. 9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible. 10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments (07\/27\/01) ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~ yes 81% no 19% Comments: ~~~~~~~~~ No. This is a funny thing to me. I hear about so many people being super scared to give out their SS#. Well folks, I can get your SS# for 50 cents. Give me a name and address and about 90% of the time I can get the number. We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes. They could do who knows what with the CC number. I once had a person tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that person (me) would have her account info and could write a check out for thousands of dollars. I told her to just send it to me then and she said that was OK. Then I asked her to tell me what the difference was between the original check and a fax copy. I told her to ask her lawyer that too. Never heard back from her. The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is available in many places. Have a good day. -- Terry  ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most importantly, never give any personal information at a site that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put in my credit information in each time instead of having an account in standing, a little more time but less risks involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier! -- Catherine F.  ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner was in a bad car accident. I had a full service account. My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address went unprotected. A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com address to a porn shop. Thus, I lost 4 years of building up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place on 8 more. This set me back about 4 months: I believe I lost a minimum of $50,000. I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times. The first time I lost almost 4 months of work. Now, I back up often enough to not to lose so much time. This is also Internet theft. These people are nothing but out and out criminals and should spend years behind bars. Customers are well protected from credit card theft; however, merchants can lose a lot of money. I sell only by purchase order and certified or registered company checks. -- Peter S.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED! And the July 'One-Question Survey' WINNER is...

By getting clear on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.   1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will have even more to appreciate. 2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly imagine. 3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals. 4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more calories. Eat only small amounts at one time. 5. Read something educational, inspirational or entertaining--preferably all three. 6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the Super-conscious. 7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy. 8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of my book, then write in my journal. 9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible. 10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete. Bonus Step: Make something work better -- Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

{"text":"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE. It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only. So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ? If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

{"text":"Politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole 'anonymity' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military HQ in Palm Beach, Florida.' Owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?* By Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies.* A discussion draft released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online. The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice and Industry Canada , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in early 2003. Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty , which the country is in the process of considering. If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden electronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In most circumstances, a court order would be required for government agents to conduct Internet monitoring. Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty , which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted , or ratified, the treaty. Michael Geist , a professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems weak. \"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that's not a particularly convincing argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case.\" Geist added that \"there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems.\" Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , but it applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies. \"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data.\" EPIC opposes the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights. Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with personal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" the draft says. Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an activist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\" \"Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet anonymously,\" Hosein said. A representative for George Radwanski , Canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on the paper as it stands.\" Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca no later than Nov. 15.","label":0}

{"text":"Today in the call for a full Supreme Court bench: The Constitutional Responsibility Project releases its second TV ad showcasing Sen. Rob Portman's (R-OH) obstruction, Americans United for Change continues its nine-state, nine-day mobile billboard tour in Pennsylvania, 225 former Sen. Grassley supporters share their stories with MoveOn.org as to why they cannot support his inaction around Chief Judge Garland's nomination, and editorial boards continue to blast Senate Republicans for creating political gridlock around judicial nominations. The Constitutional Responsibility Project releases second TV ad highlighting Sen. Portman's refusal to do his job and give Chief Judge Merrick Garland fair hearings and a timely vote. Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released a 30-second ad highlighting Sen. Rob Portman's (R-OH) refusal to allow Chief Judge Garland - a nominee with broad bipartisan support and the most federal judicial experience in recent history - a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote. The ad will air in the Columbus and Cincinnati media markets over the Senate recess. Today's ad comes days after the Constitutional Responsibility Project released a new survey of Ohio voters, conducted by Hart Research Associates. Key findings include: * 70 percent of Ohioans do not know where Sen. Rob Portman stands on Merrick Garland's nomination. When told that Senator Portman supports the Republican leadership's refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee, 59% of all voters express an unfavorable opinion, compared with just 36% who are favorable. * As Ohio voters hear of Rob Portman's decision to follow his party leaders in opposing a hearing for Merrick Garland, two in five of Portman's own voters are unfavorable to his actions, as are two-thirds of all swing voters. * Once voters learned about Merrick Garland and his background, 80 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of independents, and 32 percent of Republicans favor Garland's confirmation. * Once Ohio voters learned about Sen. Portman's decision to oppose a hearing for Merrick Garland, 48 percent of Ohio voters are less likely to support Sen. Portman, while 52 percent of independent voters are less likely to want him re-elected o This potentially puts 15 percent of the Ohio electorate in play this November as possible new voters for Democratic challenger, Ted Strickland. Former Grassley voters: You lost our respect and our votes. Today, more than 225 former Sen. Grassley supporters shared their stories with MoveOn.org to express their frustration over his failure to uphold Iowa values during Chief Judge Garland's nomination. Comments from Iowa constituents and former supporters can be seen HERE . The campaign also includes a new billboard featuring former Grassley supporters located on Fleur Drive near the Des Moines airport with the message: \"Senator Grassley: You Lost Our Respect and Votes by Playing Politics with the Supreme Court.\" Kenneth Blackledge, Iowa produce farmer and former Grassley voter: \"Blocking this nomination is purely political, I'm so disappointed. I want him to be the old Chuck again. I want him to get away from party politics and be the independent senator I used to admire.\" Jack Lehmkuhl, Cedar Rapids, IA: \"I feel betrayed by Sen. Grassley, who my family has strongly supported since his very first election, I volunteered for Sen. Grassley to help get him elected even before I could vote. But now he's lost my respect and my vote.\" Jo Comerford, MoveOn.org Political Action campaign director: \"Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley has become the national face of Republican obstruction of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland... Iowans know that the stakes are simply too high to let partisan politics force a continued vacancy on the nation's highest court.\" [MoveOn.org Press Release] 9-9-9 Tour Stops In Pennsylvania: 9 States in 9 Days for 9 Supreme Court Justices. The Americans United for Change nine-state, nine-day mobile billboard tour recently stopped in Harrisburg and Philadelphia, PA. The message to Senator Toomey was simple: Do Your Job and Fill the Vacant Seat on the Supreme Court, or Someone Else Will Fill Yours. *See digital billboard graphic designs HERE . The stops were joined by local leaders including Cole Goodman, Susquehanna Township School Board Member; Lisa M. Benzie, Attorney; Adam C. Bonin, Attorney, Election and Constitutional Law Expert; Sam Dorso, Co-Chair, Philly for Change; Ann Warneka, Registered Nurse. Aletheia Henry, PA State Director, Americans United for Change: \"Hardworking Pennsylvania families that pay Senator Toomey's salary don't get to pick and choose which parts of their jobs they want to do and forget the rest... Tellingly, Republicans like Senator Toomey, who've actually bothered to meet with Judge Garland still can't muster one good reason why he doesn't deserve a fair hearing or to otherwise disqualify him from consideration....When you look at the wealth of polling showing Independent voters are especially unimpressed with their plan to sabotage the nomination process, it's quickly becoming a question not whether Republicans will lose their Senate Majority, but by how wide a margin.\" [Americans United for Change Press Release] Sen. Grassley is making a bad bet on the Supreme Court. Jon Alexander of the Quad-City Times editorial board takes a look at the political gamble Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is making on Chief Judge Garland's nomination: \"Refusing to convene even a kangaroo court is, one some ways, unprecedented. And the maneuver is a risk on several fronts. It could energize Democrats in November. It could further handicap Senate Republicans already facing a tough year, just ask Mark Kirk. It very well could result in President Hillary Clinton sending a significantly more liberal nominee to a Democratic Senate for a seat that would otherwise be filled by the centrist Garland. And then, there's the Trump factor... Grassley's bid to save a vacant Supreme Court seat for a man without clear policy is tantamount to wagering with house money.\" Sen. Burr's obstruction of the nation's longest-running federal vacancy is an \"election season stunt.\" With Republican Senators refusing to do their job by not considering Chief Judge Garland and other judges awaiting Senate confirmation, two North Carolina editorial boards call out Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) for refusing to do his job on the nomination of Patricia Timmons-Goodson, who has been nominated to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Eastern District of North Carolina-a post that has gone unfilled since 2006. \"Burr's opposition is unfair to Timmons-Goodson personally and unfair to the system running short of federal judges... The Senate's job in reviewing the president's nominees is to advise and consent, not to pout and obstruct. That behavior is especially out of line when it comes to qualified nominees to the federal bench. It has been a long-standing custom that even when senators are philosophically different in terms of their views of the judiciary from the president, they recognize his right to place his choices on the judiciary.\"[News & Observer, 5\/02\/16 ] \"The Supreme Court stonewall is itself an election season stunt, as Senate Republicans have invented a practice of not allowing a president to fill a high-court vacancy in the last year of his term... Burr should reconsider and support her confirmation, or else there may be political consequences for his recent pattern of obstructionism.\"[Greensboro News & Record, 5\/03\/16 ] Is Sen. Grassley doing his job? [Spoiler Alert] No. Check out IsChuckGrassleyDoingHisJob.com from Why Courts Matter Iowa for updates.

Stepan has been updated his woody vegetation descriptions in the Polar Urals to reconstruct dynamics of forest structure near upper timberline for the last century. Because of some reasons (sometimes without any reasons) the work on constructing Yamal chronology is going not very well. Duration of chronology is now 7315 years (7314 BC - AD 2000). The last valuable field work has been realized in 2000, when we have collected 370 subfossil samples. Half of them have been dated. Now I successfully collect money for field work (for helicopter rent). I hope this field season will be fruitful. Meantime we have analyzed frost- and light-ring frequency in Yamal tree rings for the last 2100 years to reconstruct extreme events. The later half of this reconstruction, I hope, will be published this year in Palaeo3. Now I contracted (together with Stepan) to write by June something like textbook on tree-ring dating for archeologists (in Russian). Then I'm going to return to work on Yamal chronology. It would be pleasure to keep on our joint work.

Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but the guys from will help you ouit.

{"text":"---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: David M Date: Mar 10, 2008 4:04 PM Subject: Outrage- 2 white girls killed by Blacks To: commander@newsaxon.org Commander Schoep, I'm absolutely outraged at the recent news of the white female college students, Auburn and UNC, that have been brutally murdered by these savages! Funny how when some niggers brutally beat a white kid almost to death in Jena, the Niggers Jackson and Sharpton have to run crying when the \"white law\" wants to fry those animals for what they done. I'm guessing once these black bastards are caught, those two will once again come out of the woodwork to their defense and get them off the hook. Is NSM88 taking any action on this? The niggers and immigrants are over running this country more and more everyday and there isn't a damn thing being done by anybody. Our goverment is over run by liberal fags that only do what corporations with the big money tell them to do. They ignore whats happening to this country because they are corrupt themselves. It's time for someone to stand up and say enough of this shit. We need to move beyond the protest that fall on deaf ears and take it to the next level. We can't just go out and drag a few of these sorry bastards out and make an example of what happens when they show their ass. The liberal government would be all over us. We need to get some people in positions of power on our side. We need to start doing things that really make a difference!

{"text":"we still don't have an adequat explanation as to how Jack \"cooked up\" that figure - I do not believe it was purely out of thin air - look at the attached - which I used in the Crowley-Lowery composite just because it was \"out there\" - I made no claim that it was the record of record, but just that it had been used beforer. the Lamb ref. is his book dated 1966. I will have to dig up the page ref later. Dansgaard et al. 1975 Nature paper on Norsemen...etc used that figure when comparing what must have been their Camp Century record - have to check that too - where the main point of that paper was that the timing of Medieval warmth was different in Greenlandn and England! 25 years later my provocation for writing the CL paper came from a strong statement on the MWP by Claus Hammer that the canonical idea of the MWP being warming than the present was correct and that the 1999 Mann et al was wrong. he kept going on like that I reminded him that he was a co-author on the 1975 paper! that is also what motivated to do my \"bonehead\" sampling of whatever was out there just to see what happened when you added them all together - the amazing result was that it looked pretty much like Mann et al. ther rest is history -- much ignored and forgotten. I might also pointn out that in a 1996 Consequences article I wrote - and that Fred Singer loves to cite -- Jack (who was the editor of the journal) basically shoehorned me into re-reproducing that figure even though I didn't like it - there was not an alternative. in the figure caption it has a similar one to Zielinski except that it states \"compiled by R.S. Bradley and J.A. Eddy based on J.T. Houghton....so that puts a further twist on this because it point to Houghton not Bradley\/Eddy as the source. Jack must have written that part of the figure caption because I don't think I knew those details. but we still don't know where the details of the figure came from - the MWP is clearly more schematic than the LIA (actually the detailsl about timing of the samll wiggles in the LIA are pretty good) - maybe there was a meshing of the Greenland and the England records to do the MWP part - note that the English part gets cooler. they may also have thrown in the old LaMarche record - which I also have. maybe I can schlep something together using only those old three records. tom Michael E. Mann wrote: Ray, happy holidays and thanks for the (quite fascinating) background on this. It would be good material for a Realclimate article. would be even better if someone could get Chris on record confirming that this is indeed the history of this graphic... mike raymond s. bradley wrote: I believe this graph originated in a (literally) grey piece of literature that Jack Eddy used to publish called \"Earth Quest\". It was designed for, and distributed to, high school teachers. In one issue, he had a fold-out that showed different timelines, Cenozoic, Quaternary, last 100ka, Holocene, last millennium, last century etc. The idea was to give non-specialists a perspective on the earth's climate history. I think this idea evolved from the old NRC publication edited by L. Gates, then further elaborated on by Tom Webb in the book I edited for UCAR, Global Changes of the Past. (This was an outcome of the wonderful Snowmass meeting Jack master-minded around 1990). I may have inadvertently had a hand in this millennium graph! I recall getting a fax from Jack with a hand-drawn graph, that he asked me to review. Where he got his version from, I don't know. I think I scribbled out part of the line and amended it in some way, but have no recollection of exactly what I did to it. And whether he edited it further, I don't know. But as it was purely schematic (& appears to go through ~1950) perhaps it's not so bad. I note, however, that in the more colourful version of the much embellished graph that Stefan circulated ([1] the end-point has been changed to 2000, which puts quite a different spin on things. They also seem to have fabricated a scale for the purported temperature changes. In any case, the graph has no objective basis whatsoever; it is purely a \"visual guess\" at what happened, like something we might sketch on a napkin at a party for some overly persistent inquisitor..... (so make sure you don't leave such things on the table...). What made the last millennium graph famous (notorious!) was that Chris Folland must have seen it and reproduced it in the 1995 IPCC chapter he was editing. I don't think he gave a citation and it thus appeared to have the imprimatur of the IPCC. Having submitted a great deal of text for that chapter, I remember being really pissed off that Chris essentially ignored all the input, and wrote his own version of the paleoclimate record in that volume. There are other examples of how Jack Eddy's grey literature publication was misused. In a paper in Science by Zielinski et al. (1994) [v.264, p.448-452]--attached-- they reproduced [in Figure 1c] a similarly schematic version of Holocene temperatures giving the following citation, \"Taken from J. A. Eddy and R. S. Bradley, Earth-quest 5 (insert) (1991), as modified from J. T. Houghton, G. J. Jenkins, J. J. Ephraums, Climate Change, The IPCC Scientific Assessment (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1990).\" But I had nothing to do with that one! So, that's how a crude fax from Jack Eddy became the definitive IPCC record on the last millennium!

{"text":"Hi Phil, This is all too predictable. This crowd of charlatans is always looking for one thing they can harp on, where people w\/ little knowledge of the facts might be able to be convinced that there is a controversy. They can't take on the whole of the science, so they look for one little thing they can say is wrong, and thus generalize that the science is entirely compromised. Of course, as nicely shown in the SPM, every landmass is independently warming, and much as the models predict. So they can harp all they want on one Chinese data set, it couldn't possibly change the big picture (let alone even the trends for China). The So they are simply hoping to blow this up to something that looks like a legitimate controversy. The last thing you want to do is help them by feeding the fire. Best thing is to ignore them completely. They no longer have their friends in power here in the U.S., and the media has become entirely unsympathetic to the rants of the contrarians at least in the U.S.--the Wall Street Journal editorial page are about the only place they can broadcast their disinformation. So in other words, for contrarians the environment appears to have become very unfavorable for development. I would advise Wang the same way. Keenan may or may not be bluffing, but if he tries this I believe that British law would make it easy for Wang to win a defamation suit against him (the burden is much tougher in the states), mike Phil Jones wrote: > > Kevin, > Have a look at this web site.

AOL IM is also up at JAFOGG For gas flow for Thursday October 18, REGT has the following IT capacity: CGT 0 Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT 10 Ruston Compressor work cuts back on IT Tetco Bald Knob 50 Texas Gas Helena 50 MRT Glendale 10 Other Line AC points 10 Williams Jane 10 Carthage Delivery 15 SBS injection space 50 tomorrow in Dec out SBS withdrawal space 50 available for withdrawal with Oct or longer payback Backhaul to west 50 Amber Station is flowing 353 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 121 Mdth for today. REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to better handle system upsets. However, be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points. All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT. REGT is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies. REGT is also undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage ability and the ability to transport additional IT into the PVH. MRT is taking its Unionville Storage field out of service for a couple of days for maintainance. During this time, REGT will be working with MRT to balance service. This will limit REGT storage space over the next few days and may also limit IT at particular points. Arkla is pulling over 300 Mdth with the cooler weather and peaked at over 600 Mdth\/hr rate. I do not have the power report. Gas Prices East $2.375 West $2.290 REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004\/dth EPC - based on above = $0.0386\/dth. REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1. I will be back in the Houston office on Thursday. Thanks","label":0}

Cc: Hayslett, Rod Subject: RE: EGAS 4th Qtr I think you may be reading more into this than was meant by the memo. There are alot of business entities that roll-up into EGS. There usually is some flexibility in each business unit regarding their quarterly numbers. By having all the facts we as a team can present them to Causey. We may very well be able to accelerate earnings in one group for a quarter to make up deficiencies in another group. It would be nice to be able to discuss these options as a unit before reporting them to corporate. No one is trying to manage anything other than to give Rick a complete assessment as to what EGS results look like and the fexibility we have as a unit. This is all Tracy was trying to convey. No one has asked that you not respond to corporate only that we have a chance to see what our numbers look like as an entity before releasing to corporate. I don't think Rick has any problem with this but I will ask Rod by this memo to check with Rick to see if he does. I think this is pretty consistent with the way wholesale and retail report to corporate. Thanks. -----Original Message----- From: Hughes, James A.

{"text":"Hi Keith and Tim - Eystein is going to chat with you tomorrow, and my goal is to get as much as I can to you guys today and tomorrow. First, off the figures are great (!) - that was tough job, and I'm very impressed. Of course, I can already start to sense what the debates will be, but we can address that in the text. Here are some comments with respect to the figures - some are relevant to the text... 1) they really are great 2) is the instrumental series on the first fig (top and bottom) the same as featured in chapter 3? Need to say that. 3) rather than clogging up the caption with all the notes on each curve, how about a table for each of the two figures. Then you can include some more info on each recon - e.g., number of sites, types of proxies??) I'm thinking mainly that the captions are not pretty, but you may be able to include more summary info on each curve also 4) should we make all the series in their original and modified for the figure form available on a www site so that reviewers can play with the data and make sure they get their two cents in before this thing is all said and published? The WDC-A is ready to help w\/ posting of data and figs (see below). 5) I like the expanding time axis, but I'd be prepared to have a second one with a linear axis. In fact, I'd put it up on the www page at the same time with the data. The more we do to help others understand, the better? 6) Also, it would be good to see both the data and the figure w\/o the Gaussian-weighted filtering. What do doe these look like, can we make them available as suggested above. At the least, I'd like to see the fig w\/o the filtering, even though I know it will be a mess. How about a series of time series plots (same x and y axes as the big fig 1) - in each you show both the filtered and unfiltered series. I know this is a pain for Tim, but we really have to make sure we're not missing anything in the data. And also - that we anticipate what others will do, ask us to do, or squawk about. 7) On the forcing fig (fig 2) - why don't we see all the different experiment curves (e.g., dotted red) in the forcing plots a, b and c? Need to say why in the caption - and if they have the same forcing, so you can't see it on the plot, need to say it. This could be much easier in a table that indicates \"same as X\"). 8) On fig 2 - does the recalulated envelop of reconstructed temps also include instrumental temps? Think so, but you should say it in the caption. Why doesn't the envelop go up to present? Can it? Might look better, and be more consistent w\/ fig 1. If the envelop can't go to present, then maybe include the instrumental curve as in Fig 1. 9) reminders for the text (I'll think about these as I read a second time for editing) - 9a) need to explain why the recons don't continue going up w\/ instrumental data at the end (post 1990?) - might what to mention something in caption, if you can shift all the other stuff to a table. 9b) there will be lots of discussion (during and post AR4 drafting) about what recon series (Fig 1) should or should not be believed. Thus, I think it is critical for us to same more about each recon - that is to INCLUDE what you wrote in blue, and perhaps to enhance. Need to really convince the reader that while not one recon is alone the truth (and hence Fig 1), they all have important strengths and weaknesses. But, the former outweigh the latter, so we've included them. 9c) I'm sure you saw the recent (to be infamous) Wall Stree Journal editorial - they showed what I think was a IPCC FAR curve - with the good old MWP and LIA etc (Lamb view? - I don't have the FAR w\/ me). The way to handle the hocky stick might best be to put it in an historical perspective along with the older IPCC views. First, show your great figs, discuss them and what went into them, and then - after showing the state-of-the-art, discuss how much our understanding and view have changed. In this, simply compare each of the historical views (FAR, SAR, TAR) to the current view, and while doing so, play down the controversy (s) - especially the hockey stick. The smart folks will realize that that the fluff in the news is just that, but those with a real stake in that debate will hopefully get the point that it doesn't matter... 10) lastly (almost), I'm sorry to ask again, but I still want to know what is wrong with Tom Crowley's latest plot with all the recons shown together back through the Med W Period? I need to send you my edits on the MWP box, but it seem to me that Tom's fig could go in that box - to help make the point that - sorry, guys - the MWP wasn't much compared to the recent GLOBAL warming... 11) lastly (promise) - don't foget that Eystein and I think we can get a page or two extra for your section in the end. This means you can do all the above, and I can help (next) with the modes and extremes sections, and we can get it all in. Great job! Thanks, Peck -- Jonathan T.

{"text":"Thanks so much for your reply. I will check. But I also was wanting to know if there was by any chance an NSM office in Virginia and do they help out with transportation like busses or something if we cannot drive to all of the events NSM have. I remember seeing a link to a website but it didn't show up. Are they doing some type of maintenance on the site. Also one of the others interested is my grandfather in his 60s, he is German and supports a lot of the ideas as myself. He wants to know if you are beyond a certain age are you allowed to still join or do you have to just fill out a supporter application. I would actually like to march in public with you all in a uniformed division, but on the application the divisions are; NSM, Women's Division, Stormtrooper Division, Skinhead division, Viking Division and Farmers' Association. So I don't have any specific type of skills but would love to spread the truth and words to others and draw them to the NSM. This is how I would be able to help also by support. Hopefully that would be enough. I do not mind devoting time to the NSM if I were to join. I will check out the contacts and units now. Thanks again. Angela -------------- Original message -------------- From: William Herring Greetings sister! Thank you for your interest in the NSM. We have both uniformed and non-uniformed divisions, as a well as a Skinhead division. We recognize that different individuals have different talents and resources and so we have structured our organization to meet the needs and levels of committment of different people. You may become a fully uniformed member and march with us in public, or if you prefer, you may maintain a 'Supporter\" status. Many people have families, high-profile jobs that they understandably do not wish to jeopardize and we understand and respect this. ANy contribution to our efforts be it time, talents or money are equally important. On our main website you will find an application to download that has options for you desired level of committment. Also, there is a \"Units and Contacts\" box on the left hand side of the screen. Simply click that and you will find a complete list of all NSM units worldwide, along with contact information.

{"text":"Donald Trump plans to meet with Bob Corker as V.P. decision looms Washington Post - Robert Costa Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), whom many top Republicans consider a contender to be Donald Trump's running mate, is scheduled to meet Monday with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, according to two people close to the Trump campaign. The meeting will take place at Trump Tower in New York, the people said, requesting anonymity in order to speak freely about private conversations. Corker, 63, who serves as chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has in recent years become a central figure in policy negotiations with the Obama administration, including on the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. He previously served as mayor of Chattanooga, Tenn. The Trump campaign would not comment. Corker's spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment. Monday's meeting comes weeks after Corker praised Trump's late April address on world affairs. The people close to Trump said he has told friends that he deeply appreciated the effusive support from Corker, especially at a time when others in the party were sharply critical. Keep Reading Ever since, Trump and Corker have remained in touch and they are said to have a friendly rapport. Both men consider themselves to be deal-makers and Republican mavericks. And both come from the world of real estate - Corker, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, made has made millions on construction projects, investments and various properties. As a Senate Republican insider and establishment figure who sees Trump as a welcome addition to the GOP, Corker could fit part of the informal criteria that Trump has laid out as he thinks through his options. In an April interview with The Washington Post, Trump said that he would not pick an outsider like himself as his vice-presidential nominee, but rather, \"somebody that can walk into the Senate and who's been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.\" Last week, Bloomberg News's Josh Rogin reported that Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has also been corresponding with Corker in a \"series of phone calls\" and that \"Corker's office is supplying information to the campaign.\" Trump's aides, who have been mum about the candidate's short list, have tapped attorney A.B. Culvahouse Jr. to assist with the vetting process. His involvement, which was first reported by Bloomberg, is part of the campaign's ramping up of the selection process. Culvahouse, a longtime GOP player, was involved with Sen. John McCain's vetting of then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008. Beyond the vice-presidential speculation, Corker's visit to Manhattan represents the latest in a string of huddles that Trump has had with prominent foreign policy voices in the Republican Party, in particular those who are not traditional conservative hawks with ties to the George W. Bush administration. Trump met on Wednesday with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who served presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and last week he met with former secretary of state James A. Baker III, who served George H.W. Bush. \"What I heard in that speech was a candidate trying to espouse views not unlike Bush 41 and Jim Baker,\" Corker told reporters this month, according to Bloomberg. \"I heard some realism creeping back into foreign policy.\" The University of Virginia's Center for Politics, in a Thursday analysis of Trump's vice-presidential prospects, said that Corker would bring \"serious foreign policy cachet,\" but he \"might not be flashy enough for Trump.\" Corker, so far, has been coy about whether he's on Trump's list. \"I just have no reason to believe I'm being considered for that,\" he told reporters in early May.","label":0}

Learn More ==>  eBay ==>  ====================================================== Changes to the eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy ====================================================== Dear user, I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy Policy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of May 16, 2007, and on July 9, 2007, for current users. eBay User Agreement ==>  eBay Privacy Policy ==>  The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to in the User Agreement have not changed in any substantive way. We've made some changes to this agreement to make sure our legal documents are consistent with the ways our sites and services are evolving and to better meet the needs of our user community. You'll notice some changes to our \"Content License\" and \"Abusing eBay\" sections to that effect. The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of information we collect from you, how we use this information, and what your options are with respect to the information we collect. You'll notice a few changes to the policy, which we've made to cover new programs and site safety projects we're putting in place. --------------- Combating Fraud --------------- We're increasing our efforts to combat fraud on the site with a variety of programs. For example, we've made some changes that allow us to address \"Ask a Question\" and \"My Messages\" spam and other malicious activities using our message systems. And we're making sure our disclosures about cooperating with law enforcement allow us to respond to increasingly sophisticated fraudsters and criminals. --------------------- Streamlining Services --------------------- We've heard your comments about how many steps it takes to complete a transaction or get customer support where multiple eBay companies are involved. So we've made some changes that will allow our Customer Support team to help you with questions that span our companies. And we're streamlining your use of the services provided by members of the eBay corporate family, so your experience across the eBay Inc. platform will be as seamless as we can make it. Some of our new programs also mean you'll see eBay services and content in a lot of places (not just on the site), so we've made some changes to reflect that. -------------------------------- Customizing Your eBay Experience -------------------------------- We're rolling out programs and working with partners that help make our sites and services, and some of the ads you see on the web, more relevant and useful to you. Naturally, because we're a transparent community, we'll identify the new ads served with this program and provide you with choices about them. Beginning in July, we'll make a new preference available in My eBay--named AdChoice--that lets you tell us whether you want us to use the information we have about you to customize the ads you see. You'll be able to sign in and change your advertising preferences in My eBay at any time. You'll also notice links on the ads we serve this way, so you'll know an ad is served with the new program and be able to set your preferences right from the ad. We hope you'll agree that these changes will make the eBay sites and services work better for you. If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you don't need to take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new User Agreement or Privacy Policy, please refer to our Help pages for instructions on how to close your account.

{"text":"Dealing with this Nevada Democrats: Sanders Campaign Has Violent Streak Nevada's Democratic party on Monday warned the Democratic National Committee that Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters have a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt the party's national convention in July, as they did during the Nevada convention Saturday. The allegation is the latest fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic convention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas hotel could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed with some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made death threats against state party chairwoman Roberta Lange. Sanders' backers had been protesting convention rules that ultimately led to Hillary Clinton winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state's caucuses in February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra delegates by packing county and state party gatherings. Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work \"together respectfully and constructively\" at the convention. But the state party alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and By-laws committee, \"The explosive situation arose in large part because a portion of the community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada Democratic State Convention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-fight rather than attending an orderly political party process.\" Michael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said, \"We do not condone violence or encourage violence or even threats of violence.\" He added that the campaign \"had no role in encouraging the activity that the party is complaining about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of the people to make their voices heard.\" On Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barbara Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton's favor. Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. The letter by the state party's general counsel, Bradley S. Schrager, warns that similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site of the Democratic National Committee's July convention. \"We believe, unfortunately, that the tactics and behavior on display here in Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelphia in July for our National Convention,\" Schrager wrote. \"We write to alert you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign's penchant for extra-parliamentary behavior \u2014 indeed, actual violence \u2014 in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere that ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats.\" Several Sanders backers have condemned some of the threats against Lange and other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a current congressional candidate, said in a statement: \"There were actions over the weekend and at the Democratic convention that very clearly crossed the line. Progressives need to speak out against those: Making threats against someone's life, defacing private property, and hurling vulgar language at our female leaders.\" State party offices remained closed Monday for security reasons after Sanders supporters posted Lange's home and business addresses, email and cell phone number online. Copies of angry and threatening texts to Lange were included with the letter. Lange said she'd been receiving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and texts from inside and outside of the U.S., threatening her life and her family. Lange said the restaurant where she works has received so many calls it had to unplug the phone. \"It is endless, and the longer it goes the worse it gets,\" Lange said in an interview. \"I feel threatened everywhere I go.\" \u2014\u2014 Associated Press Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report.

I will join the short CLIVAR\/PAGES meeting (24\/25 Oct.) and a colleague - Tim Osborn will attend the larger meeting from Oct.28-Nov.1. As for question about new results , Ed Cook and I have a paper in press describing an initial attempt to reconstruct a North Atlantic Oscillation index back into the 1700s using tree-ring chronologies in Europe and North America. I will have a copy sent to you. Otherwise we have a paper soon to come out in an American book describing our early analyses of the growing Russian data. This work, developing the density network is progressing well and we have some very good reconstructions of growing season degree days- excellent spatial maps over western siberia going back several hundred years. We recently published a paper in Nature describing a 1000-year summer temperature reconstruction in the northern Urals and a brief but interesting paper demonstrating a strong volcanic influence in the tree-ring density data when they show extreme low density over large areas. We have very interesting developments from these areas of work but they are only now being written up. The usefull thing to stress is that these researches are in progress and the development of the tree-ring network is continuing well and is already providing patterns of past climate variability in northern Europe\/Russia and at a number of special locations- nortern Sweden\/Finland, Yamal, and Taimyr we have already got continuous 2000-year chronologies and have the potential (indeed we already are) to build 7-8000 year series at ech location. I will send you some reprints\/preprints and an overhead that shows the present state of the northern chronology network. Any stress on the importance of future collaboration btween us and the Russians would be wellcome. I have just heard that a proposal I submitted to Copernicus to do just this was to my amazement ruled not relevant to the programme! I look forward to seeing you in October. Very best wishes. Needless to say, if I can offer any help with drafting the white paper or similar I am happy to oblige. cheers Keith","label":0}

{"text":"---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: John Lindt Date: Apr 6, 2008 12:47 PM Subject: Young White Man To: commander@newsaxon.org Dear Commander, My name is John Lindt. I am a 26 year old white man, from California. I vote I work and I don't know why anymore. For the longest time I've been against several issues in our country, from the media brainwashing our youth in the guise of fairness and free thought to feel a shamed responsibility to the black race for injustices no longer relevant, that they were'nt apart of and that the white youth of today had no participation in. And that it's somehow okay to be like them, and ignore roots and heritage of white cultures because it is viewed as racist to be proud, except on St.Patty's day. To illegal immigration, and how were supposed to accept they are searching for a better life by destroying our neibhorhoods and schools, not to mention our economy. The constant overtaxing, the material manipulation of a perverted desire to consume, and this selfserving impetuous attitude not to care about issues in our country that should matter to any native with a social security card. The dwindling social security and overpriced healthcare, alliegences to foreign governments and corporations who ship out jobs overseas in the name of larger profit margins, and send our brothers and sisters to die for the same. And the pharmacutical industry shoving symptoms and medication down our throats everyday. To the silent war on the American family unit by devaluing marriage and the role of the father in the home, sentancing our children to certain doom. And the disarming of honest law abiding citizens who want weopons for protection in a country growing more and more dangerous everyday, and their right to hunt for sport and food. They say it's for the kids but we all know what's really happening. While a real and valuable education is lost in the dust of lies. I did'nt want to write you a novel, I'm sure you know as well as I the problems we face not just as a country but as White Middle Class Americans, and I'm sure you are quite busy, so I'll get to the point. I see it as my duty to keep myself in top health and physical condition, no drugs not to much alcohol, and I'm trying to quit cigarettes. I enjoy shooting and fishing(our polluted waters), and keeping the company of good honest White Americans. My one regret is that I never recieved any real military training, and sometimes I'm glad because I could have died in Iraq or Afganistan, plus I see no reason to fight for this country's government at present, or their interests. I want to recieve quality military training to have the tools necessary to defend my family, my property, and my country when this pressure cooker finally explodes. I don't want to have to go overseas to do so because I would be leaving my family(parents, brothers, sisters, I have no children)behind, but I will. Do you have any suggestions for me? Could you perhaps shed some light on my plight? I am faced with the constant challenge of staying afloat and trying to survive my hopes of having something, so when the day comes and I do want to start a family I can provide all that they need, like a good father should. What should I do? Your fellow American and White brother John ------------------------------ You rock.

{"text":"David - sounds promising. So, the bottom line is that a little disagreement is ok - that's a reflection of the real uncertainty? But, the discrepancy is not all that big in the end? No need to take this to a higher level? Keith Briffa is back on line and finishing off Section 6.5, so you might want to send him an email w\/ suggestions that help keep chap 6 compatible w\/ 2 and 9 - for example, with respect to solar, we acknowledge the forcing could be less than 0.5 W\/m**2, and the uncertaintly wrt to trop aerosols and land albedo is significant - we could easily be closer to chap 9's estimate. Would you say the key is that our analysis acknowledge the uncertainty so as to overlap well with the other chapters? Keith - please make sure you send your new 6.5 to David too - while you were out, he was working hard w\/ chap 2 and 9 to make sure we (the IPCC) avoid saying things that confuse. The comparison of radiative forcings from 3 different angles is what assessment is all about, and it's great David has had the patience to help figure it all out. Thx, Peck Hi Gabi, The key to your proposed solution is the updated numbers from Chapter 2. If indeed the radiative forcing change to 1750 is -1.53, then presumably you have made this consistent with the earlier part of Chapter 9. The numbers previously looked like this (I haven't seen the latest version of 6.5, but I've included the previous estimates we had in the ZOD): W\/m**2 Chapter 6 Chapter 9 MM 1750 Greenhouse gases: -2.4 -2.6 TROP aerosols: 0.5 0.2 Solar -0.5 -0.1 Volcanic: ? ? Land albedo: +0.4 0.03 Trop O3: -0.35 -0.4 Strat O3: +0.15 0.10 1'st indirect aerosol forcing 1.2 STRAT H2O -0.13 AVIATION -0.02 TOTAL -2.2 -1.7 There is essentially no change in greenhouse gas forcing from 1750 to 1700 (see for example Crowley et al., GRL, 2003), so the difference in the estimated numbers is probably due to inclusion of more things or different choices in Chapter 2. A similar statement holds for trop aerosols. One can also use these two to presume that the same also holds true for land albedo. [The value listed for that in Chapter 9 is quite small compared to some other studies; e.g., Govindasamy et al., GRL, 28, 291-294,2001.] So, to the extent these numbers are still discussed in Chapter 6, they should be made consistent with those in chapters 2 and 9. With respect to your proposed paragraph below: I would drop the comments about trace gas differences but saying land albedo changes may have been greater, along with the additional solar change, could give us the -1.8 W\/m**2 forcing. Concerning the temperature response: the Moberg et al paper itself claims 1\u00b0C difference between 1500 and 2000, but the figure seems to show a larger number, perhaps 1.3\u00b0C (again, just eye-balling it). However, the coldest time period is not in the MM but before it. I think therefore a better estimate from that paper for the MM would be 1\u00b0C. So, with respect to the sensitivity: if 0.85 W\/m**2 is unresolved, then we have a total forcing of ~0.95 W\/m**2, and a climate response varying between 0.45\u00b0C and 1\u00b0C - or a climate sensitivity for 2xCO2 of 1.9\u00b0C to 4.2\u00b0C, or pretty similar to standard IPCC estimates. I think this will work! David At 1:02 PM -0400 8\/6\/05, hegerl@duke.edu wrote: On Sat, 6 Aug 2005 hegerl@duke.edu wrote: p.s. I modified the text for MM forcing according to below theory (please yell if its off!) which would say (and has questions for you): During the cool period of the Late Maunder Minimum (approximately 1675-1715), sunspots were generally missing, and solar irradince is believed to have been smaller. This period will be used in Section 9.6 to discuss climate sensitivity; therefore we discuss its radiative forcing estimates . The estimated difference between present day solar irradiance and the late 17th century Maunder Minimum is presently -1.1 W\/m2 (best estimate, range -0.5 to -2 W\/m2 , Chapter 2), but with large uncertainties. This leads to a best estimate radiative forcing of -0.2 W\/m2 (-0.1 to -0.35 W\/m2 67% confidence interval; note that solar forcing from 1750 to the present is estimated having increased by 0.1 W\/m2 , chapter 2). Many radiative forcing changes, particularly those associated with industrialization, are very similar from the present to the Maunder Minimum as they are from the present to preindustrial (total forcing estimated of -1.53 W\/m2, see 9.2.1.2). CO2 may have been slightly lower (by???), and land cover changes may also have been glightly greater between the Maunder Minimum and 1750. This yields an approximate net radiative forcing of-1.8 W m-2 (between the late Maunder Minimum and the present, with large uncertainties. > > > Hi David et al, > > I spent some more time pondering the MM forcing. > I think the best place to start is the updated chapter 2 forcing > from preindustrial, which is (according to what Joyce pulled out of > ch 2, so hope its correct): > > -1.53 from present to the 1750 period (all included that they deem > relevant, so no volcanoes because episodic, but all else in there > including contrails and other weird small stuff, I THINK it also > includes land cover changes) > > We would have to add -0.1 for the more reduced solar (given +0.1 1750 to > now from ch2, and 0.2 from MM on), and maybe some number for the > somewhat lower CO2 between 1700 and 1750 (what would that be)? and > maybe another number for additional changes in land cover? > > Overall, the number you had before of -1.8 (after adjusting solar down > to recent wisdom) seems now pretty good to me. > Should we keep it, or do you ahve another suggestion? > I am glad we didn't loose the forcing from MM to present :))) > > greetings, let me know what would be good for us to write (and then I'll > do the arithmetic for the best guess sensitivity once you guys also > check my numbers for high\/low estimates of annual temp changes at that > period, right now its -0.45 Mann to -1.5 Moberg-readoffplotinahurry by me) > > Thanks in advance, I think we are very close to resolve this! > > Gabi > > On Fri, 5 Aug 2005, David Rind wrote: > > > As this continuing exchange has clarified, what's in Chapter 6 is > > inconsistent with what is in Chapter 2 (and Chapter 9 is caught in > > the middle!).

{"text":"Fits right into the economic frame we want to push On May 11, 2016, at 8:28 AM, Roberts, Kelly > wrote: They're talking about lowering the capital gains rate on the richest Americans below Trump's old proposal and raising taxes on some poorer Americans above his proposal Donald Trump launches tax plan rewrite - POLITICO [160510_donald_trump_44_gty_1160.jpg] Donald Trump's campaign has enlisted influential conservative economists to revise his tax package and make it more politically palatable by slashing the $10 trillion sticker price. Their main targets: Lifting the top tax rate from Trump's original plan and expanding the number of people who would have to pay taxes under it. Trump's initial proposal, rolled out with fanfare at Trump Tower in Manhattan last September, has been in the spotlight since he became the presumptive Republican nominee last week and promptly declared that it was only a starting point for any negotiations with congressional Democrats, should he become president. Story Continued Below But it turns out Trump's team is open to revamping it far sooner than that; the campaign last month contacted at least two prominent conservative economists \u2014 Larry Kudlow, the CNBC television host, and Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation and a longtime Wall Street Journal writer \u2014 to spearhead an effort to update the package. \"What we've been trying to do is help advise him a little bit to try to reduce the cost of the plan\" and still encourage economic growth, Moore said in an interview. Trump's initial plan has come under criticism from both the right and left for vastly expanding the deficit, with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimating it would add $10 trillion to the federal deficit in the next decade. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has moved quickly to tattoo the plan's steep price tag onto Trump, with her team holding a call on Monday calling it a reckless expansion of debt. \"This is the most risky, restless and regressive tax proposal ever put forward by a major presidential candidate,\" one of President Obama's former top economic advisers, Gene Sperling, said on the Clinton campaign call. The Trump team's quiet outreach to Moore and Kudlow, even before the New York billionaire had wrapped up the GOP nomination, is a sign the campaign was seeking to shore up a possible general-election vulnerability early. Over the weekend, Trump spoke openly of changing his tax plan on the Sunday shows. \"The thing I'm going to do is make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks,\" he said on NBC's Meet the Press . \"Because they have been absolutely shunned. The other thing, I'm going to fight very hard for business. For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up. And you know what, it really should go up.\" The next day, on CNN, Trump tried to clarify that he wasn't actually talking about raising rates on the wealthy, just raising them from his original plan. \"If I increase it on the wealthy, they're still going to pay less than they pay now,\" he said. While Kudlow cast the changes he and Moore are recommending as \"tweaking,\" what he described would have an enormous financial impact. Kudlow said they had already resubmitted their revisions to the Tax Foundation, which he said was now preliminarily estimating that the package would expand the deficit by $3.8 trillion \u2014 a roughly 60 percent cut. \"The full effect of all the things we talked about would have a very important reduction in the deficit,\" Kudlow said, adding, \"The economic growth would be increased, as would jobs and wages.\" Trump has not offered many policy specifics in his campaign so far but his tax package was among his most detailed. It included eliminating federal income taxes for individuals making less than $25,000 and for married couples earning below $50,000, slashing the highest income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent and cutting the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Some of those numbers could now shift, according to Kudlow, who stressed that the proposed changes he and Moore are drafting are simply \"suggestions\" for Trump. \"Mr. Trump has not signed off on any of this,\" Kudlow cautioned. Among their most notable revenue-generating recommendations is raising the top tax bracket higher from the 25 percent that Trump had originally proposed to 28 percent, according to Kudlow. That would still represent a substantial tax cut for the richest Americans. Kudlow also said that the threshold for paying no income taxes could \"be lowered a bit\" \u2014 Trump would take 33 million low-income Americans off the rolls entirely \u2014 from the original proposed $50,000 level for married couples. He did not specify the new threshold. In his initial rollout, Trump had promised that millions of households no longer paying taxes were going to get a one-page form to send to the Internal Revenue Service simply saying, \"I win.\" Not every change Kudlow and Moore are drafting would result in more revenue. Kudlow said they were also suggesting that Trump keep the capital gains tax rate at 15 percent across all income levels; Trump's original plan had that rate at 20 percent for those earning more than $150,000. He also said they would recommend letting corporations use \"immediate expensing of equipment\" for tax purposes to spur investment and economic growth. This has become a top priority for many Republicans, though it wasn't in Trump's original plan. \"Eventually the candidate will make a call,\" Kudlow said of the new proposals. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Kudlow and Moore are well known voices in conservative economic circles. They are two of the founders, with economist and former Ronald Reagan adviser Art Laffer and former GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, established last year to advance for conservative economic policies. The group met with multiple GOP presidential candidates in the last year, including Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee. The group's imprint could help add credibility on the right to a revised Trump tax plan, after his original proposal came under attack from some Republicans as unrealistically large. By one measure, Trump's proposed tax cut was four times the size of George W. Bush's 2001 tax cuts. Ryan Ellis, former tax policy director for Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, said such a proposal \"drags down the entire effort at conservative tax reform to a circus level.\" \"It's simply not realistic,\" Ellis said. \"There's no amount of entitlement reform that can pay for that, and there's no amount of base broadening that can pay for that.\" The proposed revision \u2014 reducing the overall cost to the budget, putting more people back on the income tax rolls and expanding business \"expensing\" \u2014 appears to be an effort to put Trump more in line with the broader Republican consensus on tax policy. Trump has been far more reticent than most Republicans to make changes to Social Security and Medicare, the biggest entitlement programs, instead talking about cutting back on more amorphous waste and abuse that most independent analysts agree don't add up to significant savings. But Kudlow suggested there was more spending cut details on the horizon, as well. \"There would also be a spending reduction piece as part of this overall package, which, frankly, would probably slice another $2 trillion\" off the federal deficit, he said.

The funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping the Party right NOW build the infrastructure we need for the general election. * Politico got it wrong. Their claim that state parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised is incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions haven't yet been moved from HVF to state parties, but it also hasn't gone to the DNC or anywhere else. Because this is money for the general election, and coordinated campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, it is perfectly understandable that not all of the HVF money owed to state parties would have been distributed yet. * We had JFA' s with the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and the Kerry campaign in 2004. And while the funds are going to the DNC right now to build tools and capacity for the general election, there will be a point when the funds stay in the states to fund coordinated campaigns that are now beginning to get organized. * That's why experts have agreed there's nothing unusual about the victory funds. Rick Hasen, an influential academic on campaign finance, posted an analysis on the Election Law Blog that addressed this issue. Hasen states in the article that \"it is hard to see what provision of the law\" is at issue. As the blog points out, \"legally\" the criticism of the fund \"seems weak.\"  * We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties. * Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs. * These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. * And let's be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising.

In the sub-headline that say that state parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised, but that is really incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions haven't yet been moved from HVF to state parties, but it also hasn't gone to the DNC or anywhere else.

I think it is worth keeping that in the background materials, but given that others, when asked, also said there wasn't really anything to this, maybe we just keep the on the record quote more general?

Hasen states in the article that \"it is hard to see what provision of the law\" is at issue. As the blog points out, \"legally\" the criticism of the fund \"seems weak.\"  * We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties. * Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs. * These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. * And let's be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising.

{"text":"Hi David, You can quote me with this: Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Drafting committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate. FOR BACKGROUND The rules governing our process for appointments to convention standing committees were established in 2014 long before any candidates declared and follow the same process that have governed these appointments for many cycles. The co-chairs of all of the committees and the At-Large members were elected by the DNC Executive Committee members in January 2016. That meeting was open to the public and all of the campaigns were participants in that process. The overwhelming remainder (87%) of the Standing Committee membership is elected by each state's National Convention Delegates after being nominating by the presidential campaigns, proportional to each campaign's percentage of the state wide vote. The Platform drafting committee is a subcommittee of the larger platform committee. Those members have not yet been named but the appointments will be made in consultation with both campaigns, as has been the case in past cycles. Both campaigns are fully aware of our process.","label":0}

{"text":"SL: New poll confirms Democrats united and energized for 2016 Body: A new CBS\/NYT poll shows that Democrats are more united today than in May of 2008, the latest indication that the party is united and energized heading into the 2016 election. The poll showed over 70 percent of both Senator Sanders' supporters and Secretary Clinton's supporters would vote for the other Democratic candidate in a general election. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was later elected in a landslide victory. Furthermore, 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party. By contrast, Republicans are split 55 percent to 43 percent between \"mostly hopeful\" and \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican Party. Sad! This echoes what we've seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut : Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed. New York : Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side. It's clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged.

I've sent Leah the same inquiry; wasn't sure which of you I should touch base with. Separately, it'd be great to catch up with you in LA sometime. The week of E3 is often a complete zoo, but if you were planning to head down to the show floor at any point, I'll be flying down Monday for our press conference and then flying back Friday morning. If that week's bad, I do get down to LA usually about once a month. Best, Jennifer","label":0}

{"text":"DONALD J. TRUMP RELEASES LIST OF POTENTIAL UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICES (New York, NY) May 18, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump released the much-anticipated list of people he would consider as potential replacements for Justice Scalia at the United States Supreme Court. This list was compiled, first and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican Party leadership. Mr. Trump stated, \"Justice Scalia was a remarkable person and a brilliant Supreme Court Justice. His career was defined by his reverence for the Constitution and his legacy of protecting Americans' most cherished freedoms. He was a Justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the Constitution of our country. The following list of potential Supreme Court justices is representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value and, as President, I plan to use this list as a guide to nominate our next United States Supreme Court Justices.\" Steven Colloton Steven Colloton of Iowa is a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a position he has held since President George W. Bush appointed him in 2003. Judge Colloton has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that also includes distinguished service as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, a Special Assistant to the Attorney General in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, and a lecturer of law at the University of Iowa.

The National Socialist Movement (NSM), A racist neo-nazi organization, has announced its intentions to protest Milwaukee's Pridefest the morning of Saturday June 7th. Coincidentally, Bash Back! Milwaukee had put out a call for radical transfolk and queers to come to Milwaukee the very same weekend. Thus, Bash Back! Milwaukee and Milwaukee Anti-Racist Action are calling for all radical trannies, queers and allies to go all out against the Nazis the weekend of June 6th - 8th. Following our previous call-out, Bash Back! will still be hosting an RNC strategy session the night of Friday the 6th. Plans are also still in the works for guerrilla workshops and anti-capitalist\/anti-assimilationist actions all throughout pride weekend. Sunday the 8th a Radical Trans\/Queer contingent will join the Pride Parade. The difference is that now our plans for the weekend will have the added fun of fucking with the American Nazi Party. We can use all the help we can get for the weekend. We would love canned food, pink and black flags, banners, rotten vegetables, sex toys, drums, more canned food, and anything else you can bring. If you are planning to stay the weekend in Milwaukee, Bash Back! MKE will arrange places for ya'll to stay and some stuff for ya'll to eat. Those planning to attend the RNC strategy session should arrive at the Cream City Collectives (732 e. Clarke) between the hours of 3 and 7 on Friday the 6th. And anyone planning to take part in the weekend's fun should email BashBackMKE@gmail.com to let us know you're coming. in love and rage, Bash Back!

Milwaukee Summerfest grounds have hosted every year \"Pride Fest\" as their first event to kickoff the summer festival season. Last year this \"festival\" was said to be the second largest in the country and they hope to have the largest turnout in 2008. You can see their disgusting website at www.pridefest.com. We will be on the frontlines with members of the community to say \"Not In Our Town\". A popular slogan used by antifa's when the NSM rallied here last. I find it fitting as we are not alone in this. We may not be supported by the religious and concerned citizens that will also be protesting this filth, but will not be alone with our message. We will be leafleting the attached flyer to promote our event, in turn expecting the antifa to be in full force against us. Just the way we like it! We will attempt to reach the general public in letting them know we are not supportive of this message and promotion of homosexuality in our community. Please forward this to all in your address book that may be interested in coming out to support our message. Camping and a BBQ after will be available to those who attend. More details will be provided on an individual basis an keep an eye out for more announcements referencing this event in the near future. We look forward to kicking off the summer season right!

[Macintosh HD:Users:meenayi:Documents:DEPARTMENTS:DIGITAL:MISC:LETTERHEAD_TEMPLATES:circle_d_blue-01.png] TO: Interested Parties FROM: Lorraine Miller and Jim Roosevelt, Jr., Co-Chairs of the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee REGARDING: An Overview of the Democratic Delegate Selection Process DATE: April 22, 2016 2016 CYCLE OVERVIEW Democrats are excited about the 2016 Democratic primary election season, and that's because we have strong candidates who are dedicated to solving the issues that matter most to Americans. Voters are eager to cast their vote for the next Democratic presidential nominee and participate in the Democratic delegate selection process in their state. Our process aims to uphold our Party's values of inclusivity, diversity, and transparency. Here is the Democratic delegate selection process by the numbers: * 4,765 = total number of Democratic delegates as of today * 4,051 = total number of pledged Democratic delegates * 714 = total number of unpledged delegates * 2,383 = number of delegate votes needed to win the Democratic nomination as of today * 57 = the number of presidential nominating contests PROCESS DEVELOPMENT The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee (RBC) reviews the Delegate Selection Rules prior to each presidential election year. While the general structure of the Democratic delegate selection process has been in place since 1972, the Committee, over the course of many public meetings, reflects on the delegate selection process of the previous cycle and updates the Rules accordingly. The RBC met five times in 2014 in order to finalize the Delegate Selection Rules for the 2016 cycle, which were then shared with the 57 state and territory Democratic parties. In May of 2015, each party submitted their Delegate Selection Plan to the RBC. These plans were subsequently reviewed by the Committee to ensure compliance with the DNC's Delegate Selection Rules during the summer of 2015 at three public meetings, attended by press, presidential campaigns, and other interested parties, held on June 26, July 24 and August 27. In partnership with the RBC, DNC staff, and presidential campaigns, state parties work to implement their Delegate Selection Plans starting in September of 2015 until the process draws to a close. While state and territory parties are the drivers of their process, the creation and implementation of their Plans are governed by the DNC's Delegate Selection Rules, the Call for the Convention, and the Regulations of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. These materials provide states and territories with the guidance that ensures fundamental values of the Democratic Party-such as a commitment to diversity and participation of all eligible voters-are upheld throughout this process. For example, each state and territory party solicits public comment on their Plan for no less than 30 days to allow for input from constituents, making the drafting of the Delegate Selection Plan a democratic process. Additionally, each state is required to develop and implement an extensive affirmative action and inclusion outreach plan. The state and territory parties as well as presidential campaigns are tasked with conducting widespread outreach and recruitment to encourage Democrats of all backgrounds to run to be delegates. Our Party believes that our convention should look like America, and state and territory parties and campaigns are responsible for striving to meet that diversity goal. THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATE SELECTION PROCESS VERSUS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS Some stark differences between the Democrats' delegate selection process and the Republican's delegate selection process were mentioned in the previous section, but that's not where the differences end. Outlined below are some major differences between our process and that of the Republicans: * A commitment to diversity and equal representation of men and women * The solicitation of input from the public during the creation of a state's Delegate Selection Plan * The transparent development of our Rules * Proportional allocation of pledged delegates to presidential candidates based on the results of the state's primary or caucus o Unlike the Republicans, we do not allow for \"winner-take all\" outcomes, meaning that the candidate who wins the majority vote in a state does not win all of the state's delegates. o Instead, presidential candidates who break threshold, which is 15% in all states, are allocated delegates proportional to the percentage of the vote that they won in the primary or caucus. o Delegates must affirm in writing that they are bona fide supporters of the candidates that they are representing in the delegation and are subject to review by each campaign. o We believe that this is the fairest way to reflect the intention of Democratic voters and to mirror the results at each step in the delegate selection process in the states. * Delegates elected in the states are pledged not bound, meaning that they are required only to represent in good faith those who elected them. UNPLEDGED DELEGATES An often discussed feature of the Democratic delegate selection process is the unpledged delegates, also referred to as \"superdelegates.\" These individuals serve by virtue of the elected office that they hold, and they include: * Democratic Governors * Democratic Members of Congress * Distinguished Party Leaders (such as former presidents and former leaders in the Senate and the House) * DNC Members We ensure these leaders have a voice in our convention, and their existence as a separate group means that interested voters don't have to run against elected officials in order to attend the Democratic National Convention. Unpledged delegates are also distinguished by the fact that they are not pledged to a presidential candidate based on the results of their state's primary or caucus and instead exercise their best judgment when selecting a presidential candidate to support. Concerns that unpledged delegates may change the outcome of the election are historically unfounded-unpledged delegates have never changed the outcome of an election since unpledged delegates were established over 30 years ago. Like pledged delegates, unpledged delegate cast one vote, which carries the same weight as the vote of any other delegate. There have been recent reports of harassment or mistreatment of state parties who are managing the process in their state and unpledged delegates. This does not reflect the values of this process and our great Party. State Parties are working year round to elect Democrats at every level and are the foundation of our Party. Unpledged delegates have been a feature of our process for many decades and will continue to play a role. We encourage all interested parties, including presidential candidates and members of the press and public, to learn all about their state's process. It is important that our process is open, transparent, and maximizes participation. Each state plan has undergone a rigorous review process to ensure compliance with our Rules, and changing Rules midway through the cycle would lead to confusion among participants in the delegate selection process, unnecessary costs to state parties, and inconsistent standards for states to abide by. Our Party spends years preparing for each presidential election cycle, and we believe that our process is designed to best position our Party and our eventual nominee for victory in the general election in November. We are looking forward to the Democratic National Convention in July where our delegates will cast their vote for the next President of the United States. ---- [SigDems] Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 - MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC","label":0}

{"text":"Gavin, First the figures are just for you - don't pass on!!! I don't normally see these. I just asked my MOHC contact - and he's seen the furore on the blogs. Why did the Daily Telegraph run with the story - it's all back to their readers thinking the UK is run by another country! These 3 paras (below) are from the GHCN web site. They appear to be the only mention I can see of the WMO CLIMAT network on a web site. The rigorous QC that is being talked about is done in retrospect. They don't do much in real time - except an outlier check. Anyway - the CLIMAT network is part of the GTS. The members (NMSs) send their monthly averages\/total around the other NMSs on the 4th and the 18-20th of the month afterwards. Few seem to adhere to these dates much these days, but the aim is to send the data around twice in the following month. Data comes in code like everything else on the GTS, so a few centres (probably a handful, NOAA\/CPC, MOHC, MeteoFrance, DWD, Roshydromet, CMA, JMA and the Australians) that are doing analyses for weather forecasts have the software to pick out the CLIMAT data and put it somewhere. At the same time these same centres are taking the synop data off the system and summing it to months - producing flags of how much was missing. At the MOHC they compare the CLIMAT message with the monthly calculated average\/total. If they are close they accept the CLIMAT. Some countries don't use the mean of max and min (which the synops provide) to calculate the mean, so it is important to use the CLIMAT as this is likely to ensure continuity. If they don't agree they check the flags and there needs to be a bit of human intervention. The figures are examples for this October. What often happens is that countries send out the same data for the following month. This happens mostly in developing countries, as a few haven't yet got software to produce the CLIMAT data in the correct format. There is WMO software to produce these from a wide variety of possible formats the countries might be using. Some seem to do this by overwriting the files from the previous month. They add in the correct data, but then forget to save the revised file. Canada did this a few years ago - but they sent the correct data around a day later and again the second time, after they got told by someone at MOHC. My guess here is that NOAA didn't screw up, but that Russia did. For all countries except Russia, all data for that country comes out together. For Russia it comes out in regions - well it is a big place! Trying to prove this would need some Russian help - Pasha Groisman? - but there isn't much point. The fact that all the affected data were from one Russian region suggests to me it was that region. Probably not of much use to an FAQ! Cheers Phil The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Monthly) data base contains historical temperature, precipitation, and pressure data for thousands of land stations worldwide. The period of record varies from station to station, with several thousand extending back to 1950 and several hundred being updated monthly via CLIMAT reports. The data are available without charge through NCDCs anonymous FTP service. Both historical and near-real-time GHCN data undergo rigorous quality assurance reviews. These reviews include preprocessing checks on source data, time series checks that identify spurious changes in the mean and variance, spatial comparisons that verify the accuracy of the climatological mean and the seasonal cycle, and neighbor checks that identify outliers from both a serial and a spatial perspective. GHCN-Monthly is used operationally by NCDC to monitor long-term trends in temperature and precipitation. It has also been employed in several international climate assessments, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, and the \"State of the Climate\" report published annually by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

Despite 73 straight months of private sector job growth, he has peddled utter fiction in predicting a recession and warned against investing in the stock market. He has threatened to pull back from NATO, refused to say that he wouldn't use nuclear weapons in Europe, and even said that he would punish women who obtain abortions. Tomorrow, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Congressman Seth Moulton (MA) and Congressman Ted Lieu (CA) will host a media call to discuss the catastrophic implications of a Trump presidency, in advance of Donald Trump's foreign policy speech at the National Press Club.

I have spent less money than any other candidate running for president and I'm number one. Now think of it. No think of it. No, think of 'em. So I've spent - and a big part of what I've spend is my airplane which I get reimbursed for. So that shows here - but I actually - so I've spent even less than people think. You have to put down market value. You play, whatever the hell it is, so they put it down there - so it's actually even better. But I've spent less money than any other candidate. We're number one. Others have spent 28 million. I think if I net it out, I'm at like a million bucks, right? So far it's been a good deal.\" [Trump Campaign Rally, Norfolk VA, 10\/31\/15] In His Book, \"Crippled America\" Donald Trump Said His Income Rose Since He Entered The Presidential Race. In Donald Trump's book \"Crippled America,\" \"He reports that his net worth has gone up since he entered the presidential race and estimates it at more than $10 billion, considerably higher than where Bloomberg's Billionaires Index puts it. Trump, who is running a populist campaign, says his income for 2015 'will exceed $600 million.'\" [Bloomberg, 10\/27\/15 ] Donald Trump Said His Presidential Campaign Benefitted His Business \"Because Of The Excitement Factor,\" Which He Said Was \"Even More Of An Asset Internationally.\" \"'I'm still running a business. It's doing phenomenal, and the hotels are doing even better because of the excitement factor,' he told The Post from his office on the 26th floor. The campaign, he says, is 'even more of an asset internationally. I have many projects all over the world and for those partners, in China, India and other countries, they read about the [presidential campaign] and they see the big picture,' Trump said. 'It's had a positive impact.' [New York Post, 1\/24\/16 ] Trump In 2000: \"I'm The Only Candidate Who Makes Money When He Runs.\" \"There may be many reasons to run for president of the United States, but the chance to turn a profit on the campaign trail is generally not one of them. Unless the office-seeker happens to be Donald J. Trump. 'I'm the only candidate who makes money when he runs,' said Mr. Trump, who is toying with seeking the Reform Party's nomination for president. Mr. Trump commands $100,000 a speech, he said, adding, with his trademark hyperbole, that he was the highest-paid lecturer in the country.\" [New York Times, 1\/9\/00] * Trump Cited Paid Speeches He Was Making At Tony Robbins' Seminars While On The Campaign Trail And Said \"It's Very Possible That I Could Be The First Presidential Candidate To Run And Make Money On It.\" \"Trump had inked a deal with Tony Robbins, the frighteningly upbeat motivational speaker, by which Robbins would pay Trump $1 million to give ten speeches at his seminars around the country. Crucially, Trump had timed his political stops to coincide with Robbins' seminars, so that he was 'making a lot of money' on those campaign stops. 'It's very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,' Trump said, adding that 'there's no way a good businessman' would have blown the kind of money Steve Forbes had. I wondered whether Trump was proposing his own special version of campaign finance reform here. I also wondered where he was planning to come up with the $100 million he was promising to spend if nominated, considering that his cash flow seemed much more precarious than he claimed.\" [Fortune, 4\/3\/00 ] TRUMP REPEATEDLY TOUTS HIS PROPERTIES AND BOOKS AT HIS CAMPAIGN EVENTS New York Times: \"Virtually Every Trump Speech Includes A Reference To One Of His Hotels Or Casinos\" And Sales Of His 1987 Book Skyrocketed After He Repeatedly Touted It On The Trail. \"Virtually every Trump speech includes a reference to one of his hotels or casinos; recently he heaped praise on the Doral, the luxury golf resort outside Miami he acquired in 2012. He often suggests that the Obama administration should have read his book 'The Art of the Deal' before negotiating the Iran nuclear agreement.

The previously-scheduled in-person meeting in Philadelphia, including a tour of the convention sites, was cancelled due to expected inclement weather. Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz also delivered remarks during today's call. In addition, the DNC Executive Committee voted to ratify the Chair's 2016 Party Leader and Elected Official Member appointments to the Convention Standing Committees: Credentials, Platform, and Rules. The slate of the Chair's appointments is attached in PDF format. DNC rules provide for the Chair to appoint 75 Party Leader and Elected Official Members to the three Convention Standing Committees. These Party Leader Members serve in addition to and together with the over 160 members that are elected in each and every state to those same committees. \"I am extremely proud of the experienced group of individuals who are ready and dedicated to serving our Party on the Convention Committees,\" said DNC Chair Rep.

{"text":"Martin in response to Nadia's message and our talk - consider the following as regards title and objectives Title The precedence of Ecological Responses to 20th Century Climate changes in Arctic Lakes and Trees Suggested Objectives We will quantify how the changes in 20th century Arctic climate (including mean and variability) are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records. We will determine the response of lake ecosystem parameters and the relationships with specific climatic controls. We will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years. We will generate well-calibrated , high-resolution (decadal to centennial time scales) estimates of past summer climate variability over this time in western Arctic Siberia. We will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of tree-growth and associated summer climate changes , based on selected updating of an extensive, existing network of chronologies, including long sub-fossil series extending back more than 4000 years in Yamal and Taimyr. These data (with perfect inter-annual dating accuracy) will be reprocessed to provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual, decadal and centennial timescales. We will determine (for the first time) the extent to which the independent proxy-based summer climate histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they demonstrate the precedence of recent (20th century ) climate trends in a multi-millennial context. By comparing this evidence with the output of state-of-the-art GCM experiments , simulating climate changes in the Arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years, we will explore the degree to which recent changes in Arctic lakes (and tree-growth rates) are attributable to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes.

{"text":"THE WEEK IN REVIEW: Quit copying Search News.com All CNET The Web Live tech help NOW! April's tech award 1 million open jobs News.com: Top CIOs ZDNet: PeopleSoft CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email Saturday, July 13, 2002 If you've ever taped a \"Seinfeld\" episode or traded music online, Uncle Sam may want you--to stop. Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transferring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which would limit backup copies, has drawn objections from academics and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it. Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio segment generally may \"sell or otherwise dispose of\" that analog recording or digital file as they wish. The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substantial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a consumer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as \"fair use.\" Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge said that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software. The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software. However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sharman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in the South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permission to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week that Sharman could be added to the lawsuit. Shoring up U.S. security Computer security is becoming increasingly critical to President Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-called cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked committees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end of the week. Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Internet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protection functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center. Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own privacy czar. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure that new technologies \"sustain and do not erode\" privacy protections and to verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guidelines. Who's running your computer? Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going on now with their computers. Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers piggyback malicious code on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service. According to the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full instructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacker to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X. The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating mechanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. According to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature downloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem. Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applications may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages or in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail could carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, read their documents and execute programs on their computer. Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi wireless networking technology has made its debut. IQinVision plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to put video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly install a temporary security system. This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standard. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camera maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is also invading handheld devices. Wireless equipment maker Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networking technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The card, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth quarter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other companies. Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and owners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless capabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the card, wireless access becomes an option for many. Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networking. Broadband providers are cracking down on some customers, threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access. After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi \"hot spots\" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at least 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the Net, for fun or for profit. News.com special focus: China As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the global recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerged as a primary target for foreign business.

With Halloween right around the corner, everyone has started to prepare their costumes and gather the props needed for them, but the FDA is warning against illegal colored contact lenses you might be considering for that extra Wow to your costume.  Your Amazon Gift Card If you can't see the below messageform us please click here to view it online Your card number is 36839063 I actually use the water coming from the washing machine to rinse out the cap until it's nice and clean. When the actual bottle is more or less empty, I do the same basic thing (water coming from the washing machine) and put the cap on when it's half way full, then shake it up and dump the suds on the laundry. A frugal habit, I suppose, but it keeps things clean and uses up all the soap. Yeah, my bottle of liquid detergent comes with a little \"ball\" that sits on top of the cover (pretty tightly, so when it's not being used it doesn't fall off easily) meant for m easuring and throwing in with the wash. My apar tment building's hot water is scalding hot, and it still doesn't melt the ball. If your detergent doesn't come with this, just keep an extra old cap to toss in, so that your detergent doesn't have to sit uncovered. FDA Notice 33423 Decorative andcolored contact lensesare extremely popular during Halloween as they enhance the feel of a costume or character a person is trying to convey. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning against colored contacts saying they could be unsafe. A statement issued by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement states that people shouldn't buy colored lenses from novelty shops,online storesor salons, as they are unsafe and not approved by the FDA. \"Our concern is that consumers who buy and use decorative contact lenses without a valid prescription can run significant risks of eye injuries, including blindness,\" said John Roth, director of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations. \"It is always better to involve a qualified eye care professional and protect your vision.\" It is illegal to buy or sell contact lenses without a prescription from a qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist or a specially licensed optician, the FDA states. Without prescription, these lenses can cost as little as $20. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) and other federal agencies are working together to cease the usage and sale of fake contact lenses. \"Contact lenses are a medical device and it is smart to purchase them from a medical professional who will fit them to your eye and provide you withinstructionon the use and care of the lenses,\" said Dr. Glenda Brown, president and a member of the Georgia Optometric Association in anewsrelease. \"Consumers who buy lenses that were manufactured and sold illegally can experience infections, corneal ulcers and even blindness. A lifetime of good vision is so much more important than a cheap Halloween accessory.\" Decorative contact lenses go by several names. Some of them are: Fashion contact lenses Halloween contact lenses Color contact lenses Cosmetic contact lenses Theatre contact lenses If you have any of the symptoms or signs listed below, you need to see a licensed eye doctor (optometrist or ophthalmologist) because an eye infection can become serious and you can go blind if it's not treated properly.

Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks! \u2014v1(EJB)\u2014 Sender: Michelle Obama Subject: Friend\u2014 No matter how full Barack's plate gets, he always makes time for reading letters from folks like you. And when he can, he writes back, because he knows who he serves. And thanks to supporters like you, we've been able to accomplish so much on behalf of so many. When I look around and see just how far we've come in the past seven and a half years, I'm truly amazed by the steps forward we've made on everything from health care to higher education to making sure we're leaving the planet a little better off than we found it for our children and grandchildren. All of that is because folks like you stood up for what you believed in and dug deep to help us cross this finish line. I know if he had the time, Barack would write a personal thank you note to each and every one of you. Because that is how we got to where we are today. So this is my way of offering our thanks from the bottom of our hearts. Our work isn't done yet, and so much will hang in the balance of this upcoming election, but I know that with supporters like you fighting the good fight, we're going to continue to build on this progress and see even more amazing things to come. If you're ready to stand up again and help us get there this November, add your name with mine: LINK Thank you again, NAME. Michelle \u2014v2(CH)-- Sender: Michelle Obama Subject: Thank you so much, NAME. Really. I know I say that often, but it's because I mean it. When I think about what folks like you have come together to accomplish over the past seven and a half years, my heart feels so full. We've come so far and done so much, and it's absolutely because you've been on the front lines fighting for the change we believe in, change that truly makes a difference in people's lives. Our kids and grandkids are more likely to grow up in a world where their only limits are how big they're willing to dream and how hard they're willing to work. They'll inherit a country with a growing economy, with opportunity to explore affordable higher educations options, with the chance to get a start in life without the overwhelming burden of health insurance costs because mom and dad can cover them for a few more years. And it's worth pointing out, NAME: There are some folks who thought we'd never see this day. But your tenacity and your unwavering commitment to forming a more perfect union are what carried us through the most difficult parts of this journey. And I'm so proud be able to say I was there working with you. Right now, the next chapter of our country is entirely in your hands, NAME. And I have total faith that you'll do great things because I've seen what you can do. But this moment is all about celebrating you, because you are the reason we've made it this far, and the reason we'll keep doing the work that matters to make a difference. So, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so, so much. Michelle P. S. \u2014 The first step in continuing this fight long after Barack and the girls and I have left the White House is by electing leaders who want to fight with us. Add your name if you're ready to do whatever it takes between now and November 8th to make sure we do it: LINK \u2014v3(JGR)\u2014 Sender: Michelle Obama Subject: I write to you a lot, NAME, for so many different reasons. Sometimes I'm asking you to make a contribution to help get more Democrats elected across the country. Sometimes I'm asking you to take a stand against the Republicans who want to take Barack's place in the Oval Office and undo all our hard work. But today, I want to say something else: Thank you. It goes unsaid too often by too many people, and I want to make sure I never ever forget to thank you for your commitment to Barack, and to this movement and the change we're creating together. Because at the end of the day, that's what this has all been about -- change we truly believe in, and change that we fight for. I'm so grateful that you're on this team, fighting for our values, and fighting to improve the lives of millions of Americans. And I can't tell you enough how much it means that you've stood by us for all these years, and that you're going to continue to stand up for what we believe in long after Barack has left office. I know our work doesn't end when the next president steps into the White House, and I know you'll keep pushing this country forward with your passion and your commitment to our Democratic values of equality and opportunity for all. So today, add your name next to mine to say you're ready for what's next: LINK Once again: Thank you, NAME. Michelle","label":0}

{"text":"NSM Party Members, We recently conducted a confidential NSM Officers meeting in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The details of the Officers meeting was to hammer out a more structured chain of command, thus assigning more responsibility to Regional Leaders, and assigning exact States\/Regions for those Leaders to Oversee. This means more work for our Regional Leaders, but less strain on NSM HQ and our immediate staff. Regional Leaders still answer directly to HQ, but due to the large number of new troops, the Regional Leaders must step up and coordinate beyond State or Local borders to insure that new troops are active and mobilzed in area's that we currently do not have Leaders, or active NSM chapters. This does not diminish the work of any of our local group Leaders, or contact points. Some chapters are slow moving others are growing fast, your Regional Leaders are there to assist you, and the more active local chapters will be key to the expansion of the Party. Local Leaders that can branch out further will be considered for future posts, and Officer Corps in the distant future. Some area's of the Nation where the Party is not as strong, we will be looking for more Regional Leaders to remove the burden off the current Leaders. Effective Nov. 9th you will see several current NSM Leaders advance into the Officers Ranks of the Party, and the assignment of Regional Leaders will be made known shortly. Rank Promotions will also be given out on Nov. 9th, therefore we are asking active NSM Leaders\/members to make suggestions to HQ privately if you have anyone you would like to reccommend for consideration on promotions, and why they should be promoted. At this years Officers meeting there was live German Folk music, traditional food, dancing, and more. 88 -- Commander Jeff Schoep \"If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.\" National Socialist Movement www.nsm88.org The information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged.

For Planning Purposes Only May XX, 2016 Contact: [Name], [Number\/Email] *MEDIA ADVISORY* TOMORROW, [DATE] at [TIME] ET: Labor and Business Join Forces to Call for Increase in Infrastructure Investments [CITY]- Our nation is in the midst of a worsening infrastructure crisis, but Republicans in Congress have refused to act to ensure safety on our roads and bridges. This week is National Infrastructure Week, which highlights the common interests of labor and business in calling for additional investments in infrastructure. Tomorrow, Democrats and leaders from the business and labor communities will call on GOP lawmakers to stop blocking bills that would fund much needed internal improvements for our country. Join XXX, XXX, and XXX TOMORROW, [DATE] at [TIME] to call on [insert Republican Member of Congress] to fund maintenance on [INSERT STATE]'s public roads and bridges. WHO: Labor and Business Leaders WHAT: Press Conference on Infrastructure Funding WHEN: TOMORROW, [DATE], [TIME] WHERE: [LOCATION] For more information, please contact [state party comms director]. ### For Immediate Release May XX, 2016 Contact: [Name], [Number\/Email] Labor and Business Leaders Call on Republican Lawmakers to Fund Much-Needed Infrastructure Improvements [City]- Underfunding of public roads and bridges in the United States have put residents in danger of transit accidents on a daily basis. Yet Republican lawmakers like [INSERT GOP MEMBERS OF CONGRESS] repeatedly refuse to invest in our nation's infrastructure. Labor and business leaders gathered today to call for funding to address this serious matter in honor of National Infrastructure Week. \"As a business owner, I find it unconscionable that our congressman has failed to make sure our roads and bridges are safe,\" said XXXX. \"It's not a partisan issue to properly fund our transportation network, but he is making it one and putting his constituents in danger in the process.\" If Hitting House Member: In 2012, XXXX supported a transportation bill that was strongly opposed by safety and environmental advocates. It would have covered only five percent of the funds needed to pay for the entirety of national mass transit repairs. If Hitting Senator: XXXX has repeated blocked bills to fund national infrastructure repairs. In 2011, XXXX blocked President Obama's plan to allocate $60 billion in for much-needed highway, rail, transit and airport repairs and construction. And in 2015, XXXX helped defeat an amendment that would have allocated $478 billion in infrastructure investment while remaining deficit-neutral. \"If the roof of your house is leaking, you try to fix it immediately instead of waiting for the whole thing to cave in,\" said XXXX. \"[SENATOR or MEMBER]'s actions simply don't make sense. He is putting our lives at risk for refusing to act.\" ### Letter 1 Editor Under President Obama, we've seen 14 million new jobs created. But we can do even more if Republicans in Congress would agree to invest more in infrastructure projects \u2013 not only repairing our crumbling roads and bridges, but also wiring rural America and installing green energy infrastructure. These investments are what's needed to create even more jobs while making our nation stronger. Infrastructure shouldn't fall victim to partisan political games. Investing in roads, bridges, railroads, and airports is fundamental to our economy. Expanding broadband internet access and installing wind and solar panels in communities across the country will build a stronger future and create millions of jobs. Investments in wiring rural America, in particular, would pay off in spades by allowing rural families to grow their businesses online, tapping into e-commerce in order to provide for their families. Simply put, investing in infrastructure helps lift up hardworking families. When Republicans block infrastructure spending, they kill jobs, make our roads and bridges less safe, and block hardworking Americans from gaining internet access. We need to focus on efforts to grow America\u2014not limit our progress because of political strife. Sincerely, Rachel Palermo Letter 2 Editor: The backbone of our country is our infrastructure. As our transportation networks crumble, public life suffers. Looking towards the future, I am concerned that our country is falling behind. All investments in our infrastructure double as an investment for our country's residents. Transportation is a vital engine of our economy, ensuring people can get to their jobs and that goods can get from businesses to customers. While we allow our bridges and roads to fall into disrepair, we are failing to meet the needs of our growing population and economy. Recent opportunities to improve our nation's infrastructure have been thwarted by the political games of the Republican Party in Washington. On the other side of the aisle, Democrats are invested in creating jobs at home by ensuring our transportation network is safe and efficient, and by going a step further. Democratic efforts to invest in projects such as high-speed rail, renewable energy, and broadband internet would create millions of jobs while ensuring that our nation stays on the cutting-edge. Previous generations recognized the necessity of infrastructure innovations and now is our opportunity to pay the same progress forward. Let's put our family members, friends and neighbors to work and build the transportation network of tomorrow. Sincerely, Jenna Price Editor: As National Infrastructure Week kicks off, I am calling on Republican politicians including our representative, XXX, to stop blocking investments that would repair our crumbling infrastructure and create jobs. Our nations' aging highways, bridges, and water systems are in urgent need of repair, but the Republicans continue to oppose the necessary investments which make our transportation system safer, create jobs, and alleviate congestion in and around our major cities. The water crisis in Flint, Michigan is the most overt example of the GOP's willingness to cut costs without any regard for the impact their ill-conceived decisions may have on a community. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed the emergency mangers who decided to draw water from the polluted Flint River, and then Congressional Republicans doubled down on their failure by refusing to approve the funding needed to replace Flint's corroded pipes. Ignoring a problem won't solve it. The AFL-CIO, the Chamber of Commerce and other groups recognize the need to repair, improve, and expand America's crumbling infrastructure. It's time for the GOP to do the same. Sincerely, Deshundra Jefferson Editor: National Infrastructure Week isn't the sexiest of causes to celebrate \u2013 that much I know. But what I also know is this: infrastructure is fundamental to our economy and our daily lives. Think about it: every day we use bridges, roads, and airports to get around; every day we use the internet to connect with the world; and every day we use products that were created in factories and arrived safely to the stores we bought them in. However, our nation's infrastructure is crumbling. We need to make investments quickly or risk paying the consequences. Both Democratic candidates for president have detailed plans for investing in infrastructure that would create millions of jobs and give Americans the 21st century transportation network they deserve. Republicans have had their way obstructing new investments in infrastructure for years. We need to elect leaders up and down the ballot who understand our prosperity can only grow when we have the infrastructure to support it. The presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump? He hasn't a clue. In fact, as it relates to infrastructure, the only concrete thing we've heard he'll do is build a \"great wall\" to keep out rapists and other criminals who are apparently making their way over in droves. Seriously. As Trump even declared at a campaign rally in Tampa, Florida, \"You watch, and that wall will go up like magic.\" Our country doesn't need a wall. What we need are bridges, and we need them now more than ever. [We need to take out reference to the wall. Please tweak.] Sincerely, Walter Garcia TJ Helmstetter Deputy Director of Regional and Specialty Media Democratic National Committee 202.863.8022 \u2013 desk 973.464.9224 \u2013 cell HelmstetterT@DNC.org From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 5:34 PM To: Paustenbach, Mark; Miranda, Luis Cc: Walsh, Tom Subject: RE: APPROVE: Sample infrastructure materials From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 1:28 PM To: Paustenbach, Mark; Miranda, Luis Cc: Walsh, Tom Subject: APPROVE: Sample infrastructure materials Below: Four letters to the editor, a media advisory, and a press release.

Sent from my iPhone Begin forwarded message: From: Michael Briggs > Date: April 29, 2016 at 4:28:17 PM EDT To: > Subject: NEWS: Independent Investigation Confirms Sanders Campaign Told the Truth Reply-To: Michael Briggs > [Bernie 2016] Independent Investigation Confirms Sanders Campaign Told the Truth April 29, 2016 Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653 BURLINGTON, Vt. - Four months ago, in an impulsive overreaction and at a critical point in the campaign just weeks before the closest Iowa caucus results in history, the DNC shut down the Sanders campaign's access to its own voter file data, only restoring access after the campaign filed a lawsuit in Federal court. Now, four months later, an independent investigation of the firewall failures in the DNC's shared voter file database has definitively confirmed that the original claims by the DNC and the Clinton campaign were wholly inaccurate - the Sanders campaign never \"stole\" any voter file data; the Sanders campaign never \"exported\" any unauthorized voter file data; and the Sanders campaign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign's \"strategic road map.\" In fact, the independent investigation has confirmed what the Sanders campaign said from the start: * The DNC's security failures allowed four Sanders campaign staffers - three junior-level staffers led by a manager who had been hired at the recommendation of the DNC and who was immediately terminated after the incident - to have extremely short-lived access for one hour to Hillary for America's scoring models, but not to any of Hillary for America's proprietary voter data. * No one else in the Sanders campaign, outside these four staffers, accessed the Hillary for America's scoring models or had knowledge that the activity was taking place until well after the incident was over. * With one exception, all unauthorized access took place within the DNC's own system. While there is evidence that the terminated staffer may have exported a summary data table, the independent investigation of Sanders campaign computers could not locate that file and no one in the Sanders campaign has ever seen that file. With the investigation behind us, the campaign has withdrawn its lawsuit against the DNC today but continues to implore the DNC to address the systemic instability that remains in its voter file system. It is imperative that the DNC make it a top priority to prevent future data security failures in the voter file system, failures that only serve as unnecessary distractions to the democratic process.

Welcome back to cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the self-pity can't get much worse. The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. \"3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87,\" read the Denver Post, repeating a popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" does spring to mind. So does the phrase \"gloom and doom.\" \"Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States,\" said the San Jose Mercury News. \"Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again,\" wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines \"demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom\" and \"disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond.\" OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more. The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement \"Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market.\" And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, \"This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse.\" Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that \"the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty.\" We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. The \"bottom\" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer No Happy Endings in September Bear drags stocks deeply into den Market's September is worst since 1937 Dow posts worst month in 4 years Market's Worst Quarter Since '87 Crash Limps to a Close For Dow and S&P, Worst Quarter Since '87 3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87 (Denver Post) Market's tumble persists, capping worst three months in 15 years Stock Market Quarterly Review (Paid subscription required.)

It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify. Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, \"If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath.\" The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- \"without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,\" quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter. One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. \"Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,\" the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May 2001. Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson Global Crossing: What Did Winnick Know?

{"text":"More good news out of Nevada \u2013 we're continuing to increase our voter registration lead over Rs From: Stewart Boss Sent: Monday, May 02, 2016 8:17 PM To: Stewart Boss Subject: Ralston Reports: Democrats double Republicans in voter reg last month, ominous sign for GOP Ralston Reports: Democrats double Republicans in voter reg last month, ominous sign for GOP by Jon Ralston Mon, 05\/02\/2016 I have said and written many times that registration is not destiny. But those numbers mean something -- and 2016 is starting to look like 2012 and 2008 in Nevada, presidential years in which the Democrats did very well. The latest numbers show the Democrats padded their statewide lead by about 5,000 voters in April, out-registering Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin. This came despite the herculean efforts of the conservative registration outfit, Engage NV, which is trying to make up for the biennial ineptitude of the state GOP and a surging Democratic Party eager to atone for the 2014 wipeout. The numbers tell an ominous story for the GOP: \u25ba Democrats now have a 64,635-voter lead over the GOP, or more than 5 percent (40-35). Democrats have added 47,606 voters this year; Republicans have added 30,583. Thus, the Democrats have increased their lead by about 17,000 voters. So the Democrats, mostly because of same-day registration for the Feb. 20 presidential caucus, have made up for recent losses because of voter roll attrition. These gains have been felt in congressional districts and legislative districts, too, widening Democratic leads or cutting into GOP edges. (See below.) For instance, in Clark County, the Democrats now have a nearly 113,000-voter edge -- that's a 13 percentage point edge. \u25ba In 2012, when President Obama won the state, the Democrats led by only 37,000 voters at this point; they ended up with a 90,000-voter edge by Election Day. In 2008, when Obama won the state, Democrats had a 51,000-voter edge at this point; they ended up with a 100,000-voter lead by Election Day. Republicans can point to Rep. Joe Heck and Sen. Dean Heller holding on despite the Democratic wave in 2012, but flawed Democratic contenders helped. And look how far ahead of those 2008 and 2012 paces the Democrats are. Smart Republicans are worried about this trend, whether it is caused by Donald Trump or the Reid Machine or some combination thereof. The GOP can hold out hope that the growing nonpartisan registration, now at almost 19 percent, might favor their slate. But as Harry Reid seeks to go out with a bang, these numbers indicate the Democrats' chances of winning Nevada in the presidential race, keeping Reid's seat, taking two competitive congressional seats from the GOP and turning the Legislature blue again are not pie in the sky. Some of the breakdowns in key areas: Clark County - Democratic gain of 5,645 End of March: 12.6% (107,091) advantage End of April: 12.9% (112,822) advantage Washoe County - Democratic loss of 49 End of March: 2.2% (5,184) disadvantage End of April: 2.2% (5,231) disadvantage Congressional District Highlights Congressional District 3 \u2013 Democratic gain of 1,049 End of March: 1.0% (3,274) advantage End of April: 1.3% (4,350) advantage Congressional District 4 - Democratic gain of 1,514 End of March: 9.7% (30,392) advantage End of April: 10.0% (31,923) advantage Senate District Highlights Senate District 5 \u2013 Democratic gain of 192 End of March: 5.1% (3,165) advantage End of April: 5.3% (3,367) advantage Senate District 6 \u2013 Democratic gain of 286 End of March: 5.2% (3,370) advantage End of April: 5.5% (3,656) advantage Senate District 15 \u2013 Democratic gain of 29 End of March: 2.3% (1,755) disadvantage End of April: 2.3% (1,730) disadvantage State Assembly District Highlights Assembly District 5 \u2013 Democratic Gain of 179 End of March: 6.6% (1,892) advantage End of April: 7.0% (2,070) advantage Assembly District 8 \u2013 Democratic gain of 157 End of March: 14.8% (3,694) advantage End of April: 15.0% (3,849) advantage Assembly District 9 - Democratic gain of 157 End of March: 7.3% (2,120) advantage End of April: 7.6% (2,284) advantage Assembly District 10 - Democratic gain of 268 End of March: 23.7% (5,225) advantage End of April: 24.2% (5,494) advantage Assembly District 21 - Democratic gain of 96 End of March: 7.2% (2,109) advantage End of April: 7.4% (2,210) advantage Assembly District 29 - Democratic gain of 96 End of March: 3.2% (1,056) advantage End of April: 3.4% (1,157) advantage Assembly District 34 - Democratic gain of 157 End of March: 12.8% (3,784) advantage End of April: 13.1% (3,939) advantage Assembly District 35 - Democratic gain of 174 End of March: 5.3% (1,741) advantage End of April: 5.7% (1,918) advantage Assembly District 41 - Democratic gain of 145 End of March: 7.2% (2,129) advantage End of April: 7.5% (2,274) advantage -- Stewart Boss Press Secretary Nevada State Democratic Party (704) 733-0313 @stew_boss","label":0}

Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com Dear Sir\/Madam SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom\/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel\/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and God Bless. Best Regards COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com N\\B.

Doyle ___________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Remembering Garrett U.S. senator from Oregon hopes his memoir will help other families with children suffering from depression By Susan Whitney Deseret Morning News Gordon Smith begins his book by telling about the night the police came to his door. It was 10 p.m. on Sept. 8, 2003. Image Smith Family Photo Sen. Gordon Smith and his wife, Sharon, with their son, Garrett, at Garrett's high school graduation in June 2000. Garrett had a high IQ, but dyslexia made school difficult for him. Smith, who is a U.S. senator from Oregon, had been away at a political event with his wife, Sharon. They'd just returned to their home in Bethesda, Md. While they were on the road they'd tried to reach their son Garrett, a student at Utah Valley State College in Orem. They had called and called, but Garrett hadn't picked up the phone. His parents were alarmed because their son had changed the greeting on his answering machine. \"I'm not feeling well,\" Garrett's new message said. \"Please don't call me anymore.\" And so Smith's book begins with these words, \"I can still hear the knock at the door. I can still feel the dread that filled my heart.\" His dread was not misplaced. The police did, in fact, come to tell the Smiths that Garrett had killed himself. Then the Smiths knew the deepest sorrow of their lives. Smith calls it a black valley of grief. He also felt an abiding sense of failure. What did it matter that he was a U.S. senator, had been a bishop in the LDS Church, a successful businessman? Those achievements seemed mere vanities to Smith, especially when compared to his most important responsibility, his responsibility to his family. He felt he should have been able to save his child. Smith's book, \"Remembering Garrett; One Family's Battle With a Child's Depression,\" has just been published by Carroll & Graf. Smith will be in Salt Lake City on Tuesday for a book signing, where he will also talk briefly and answer questions. Before Garrett took a bottle of sleeping pills, Smith says he knew very little about depression. He had never taken a psychology class. He didn't know the signs of impending suicide. When he comes to Salt Lake City, Smith expects to meet at least a few other parents who missed the warnings. Image Gordon Smith's book tells of the depression and eventual suicide of his son, Garrett. In a recent telephone interview with the Deseret Morning News, Smith said he and his wife have friends and relatives in Utah and \u2014 ever since their own son died here \u2014 he has been amazed to hear about a large number of young Utahns who have killed themselves. \"It is so heart-wrenching for the parents,\" he said. \"It is the ultimate in self-recrimination.\" Smith never blamed his wife for Garrett's death and praises her as a wonderful mother. Nor do he and his wife blame Garrett's friends or Garrett's doctors or the staff at the college. However, until he learned more about the bipolar disorder his son suffered from, Smith did blame himself. For a time after Garrett died, Smith wanted to quit the Senate to be home more often with his other two children. During the days after Garrett's death, President James E. Faust, second counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, called Smith three times. He consoled Smith and counseled with him, and when, during the third call, Smith told him he wanted to leave his job, President Faust told him not to. As Smith recalls it, President Faust said the Smiths' other children needed to see their father's good example. They needed to see him grieving, fully, without giving up. In the end, being in the Senate gave Smith a chance to do something that meant a lot to him. He sponsored a bill to fund screening tests for depression in children and to beef up the suicide-counseling programs at various colleges. His fellow senators are compassionate people, according to Smith. Democrats as well as his fellow Republicans grieved with him. \"Each found a way to put an emotional arm around me.\" Hillary Clinton took him for a long walk to talk things over. Ted Kennedy approached him repeatedly, with tears in his eyes, unable to speak. Catholic senators lit candles in their parishes. Protestants included the Smiths in their prayer circles. Joe Lieberman had the Smiths remembered in his synagogue. Sens. Kennedy and Orrin Hatch wrote the introduction to \"Remembering Garrett.\" Image Smith Family Photo Garrett Smith and his dad at Reagan Airport in Washington, D.C., when Garrett left for an LDS mission. Gordon Smith said Garrett worried about being able to memorize the lessons and scriptures. He also said Garrett was sometimes depressed on his mission, but overall he treasured his experience. The retired chaplain of the U.S. Senate, Lloyd John Ogilvie, helped Smith find a way through the pain. Ogilvie counseled gratitude. Smith still deals with his grief by praying to thank the Lord for the nearly 22 years he was able to spend with Garrett. It also helped when a psychologist told him that he could have been home with his family every night and his son still would have lacked sufficient levels of serotonin in his brain, still would have been chemically depressed. Meanwhile, at Utah Valley State College, psychologist Jack Jensen, director of counseling and psychological services, said he was not aware of the federal grant that bears Garrett's name \u2014 and so the school did not apply for it. However, UVSC counselors are planning a new outreach program, Jensen explained. Part of what they want to do is train staff and professors. Jensen and the other counselors believe depressed students will often drop hints, either in what they write for a class or in what they say to a teacher. One of the first things the counselors will teach the faculty is to never promise a student confidentiality, said Jensen. The teacher needs to call the student's therapist, if there is one, or the counseling center. The teacher needs to call the student's parents, maybe even his religious leaders, Jensen said. \"The thing is to get them some help.\" They've had far too many suicides, Jensen said. The year Garrett Smith killed himself, he was one of eight UVSC students who did so. Jensen said only one or two of those students was seeing a therapist at the time of their deaths. (Garrett had seen a psychologist and also had a prescription for an anti-depressant.) As for Gordon and Sharon Smith, they have gone on to learn all they can about suicide. Smith says they are particularly impressed with Columbia University's TeenScreen Program (www.teenscreen.org). Smith says the test is highly accurate in predicting whether a child is prone to depression and gives parents the tools to help. In the Smiths' hometown of Pendleton, Ore., public-school officials heard about the Columbia screening test in March 2003, got funding through a local Catholic hospital, and began screening teens throughout the county in 2004. District officials plan to offer the test, with parental permission, to all seventh-graders. Parents are informed of the results and are told how to get help if their child is found to be depressed. Therapy is available regardless of the parents' ability to pay. In his book, Smith tells several anecdotes about Garrett's despondence. When his son was 15 or so, Smith recalls that Sharon found him crying in his room. Garrett said he had just realized he could never get married because he would never be smart enough to support a family. His parents tried to reassure him. In the end, they believed they had. Writing a book about his son's death crystallized the pain, requiring Smith to relive Garrett's struggles and feelings of worthlessness. But it was also healing, Smith said. He loved writing about his happy times with Garrett and about his son's sweet nature. Smith seems to find it healing, also, to tell as many parents as he can about the screening tests for depression. It is something he wishes he'd known about sooner. Smith said, \"We take our children to get vaccinations and dental checkups but we never think of getting them a mental-health checkup.\" __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

By championing the Social Security Act, Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act of 1965, and the Affordable Care Act, the Democratic Party has a long and extensive history of advocating for the protections and retirement security that seniors deserve. In my capacity as a member of Congress who represents many South Florida retired and older Americans, I have been proud to carry on that tradition by fighting for seniors' health care and economic security day after day. Let there be no doubt: at a time when far too many of my Republican counterparts want to slash critical programs that seniors depend on, the Democratic Party will continue to be a champion for advocate for the dignity older Americans have earned through a lifetime of hard work.\" not just during the month of May, but every month of the year.\" -- Walter Garcia Western Regional Press Secretary Democratic National Committee (DNC) Email: GarciaW@dnc.org Twitter: @WalterGarcia231","label":0}

This is a good thing. Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely to result in smarter investments in the future. Nobody is supposed to win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. \"A fool and his money are soon parted\" and all that. It isn't the job of the FTC\/SEC\/IRS\/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job). > They > finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off > hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down. So what? Nobody is guaranteed employment. Laying people off is not a crime nor is it immoral. Companies don't exist to provide employment, nor should they. The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds. > So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

Screening will prevent mothers from seeking other solutions to their problems, like, nutrition, hormones, etc. Why be put on drugs prescribed to treat an unscientific \"disorder\" when there could be an actual medical reason for the way a mother is feeling?

{"text":"Ben, I support you on this. However, there is more to be said than what you give below. For instance, it would be useful to note that, in principle, an audit scheme could be a good thing if done properly. But an audit must start at square one (your point). So, one can appear to applaud McIntyre at first, but then go on to note that his modus operandi seems to be flawed. In this case, as you have noted before, if Mc could not get the data from us, then he could have got it from Douglass. Given this, it is strange to keep hounding us. This would, of course, raise the issue of whether the Douglass data are the same as ours (and\/or the same as in CCSP 1.1). I'm not sure whether Douglass et al. actually state that there data are the same as CCSP 1.1, but it would be good if they did -- because or IJoC data are the same as CCSP 1.1. Mc could say that Douglass already effectively audited our calculations from the raw data, which is why he does not want to\/need to repeat this step. But if he does say this then why not get the data from Douglass? Have a go at writing something -- but try to pre-empt any come back from Mc or others. Also, don't just consider our case, but put it as an example of more general issues. The issue of auditing is a tricky one. The auditers must, themselves, be able to demonstrate that they have no ulterior motives. One way to do this would be to audit papers on both sides of an issue. In other words, both us and Douglass should be audited together. In a sense, our paper is an audit of Douglass -- and we found his work to be flawed. A second opinion on this already exists, through the refereeing of our paper. I suppose a third opinion from the likes of Mc might be of value in a controversial area like this. But then, is Mc the right person to do this? Is he unbiased? Does he have the right credentials (as a statistician)? One could argue that IPCC had an auditing system in place. This is partly through the multiple levels of review -- but doesn't each chapter have another person(s) to sign off on the responses to review comments? There are some interesting general issues here.

It will occur every Wednesday at 8:20AM EST and will run 7-8 minutes. We can shape this segment to be what we want it to be. Some options to consider: * Push oppo\u2026craft a weekly hit job that Research and Comms agree on. This will require a process that makes sense\u2026like agreeing on an oppo point in the Friday week ahead; locking in consensus with show producers on Monday morning; pulling the research on Monday afternoon; synthesizing toplines and briefing on Tuesday; and amplifting the segment on Weds (factivist, social?). * Reward\/empower state parties\u2026perhaps by booking a different state party talker every week to lend their local perspective on a national topic that relates to the general. This will require less process on our end as it will be up to State Party teams to deliver our TPs via a local perspectives. * Assign the segment to a specific DNC talker. SIRIUS feels that this option works best to curate an audience through a familiar voice they associate with our DNC brand. Given the ongoing nature of the POTUS Radio team's commitment, if we go this way, we should assign the segment to someone who will never have another booking obligation in the 8:20AM EST slot. This, in effect, would be their show, their audience to build like Donna does on CNN. Happy to discuss at tomorrow's Week Ahead, but those are my thoughts. I'm negotiating similar segment cycles with SIRIUS's \"Urban\" (topic: voting rights) and \"Progress\" (audiences: gay, afam), and will continue to expand as I connect with the rest of their producers next week. To wit \u2014 Think of this as an opportunity to build the election's finest broadcast messaging specialists around inter-departmental briefing processes that make sense. Here to help!

{"text":"The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far (Filed: 28\/08\/2002) So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield. Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph\/YouGov survey this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad. Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia. After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side. \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet,\" said Kommersant. \"In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.\" The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour. It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops. And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that \"the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life. \"The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks.\" There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling. The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics. While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty. \"For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.\" One or two potential emigr\u00e9s might be deterred by language difficulties. There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border. However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live. France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists\". Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons. Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common. And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible. Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself\". Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia. \"Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens.\" Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home. ------------------------ Yahoo!

{"text":"This is good. Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org From: Palermo, Rachel Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 3:49 PM To: Paustenbach, Mark; Miranda, Luis Cc: Price, Jenna; Helmstetter, TJ Subject: Vox: Donald Trump's position on transgender rights is incoherent, not \"nuanced\" Took parts out. Luis\/mark is this good to go to national and lgbt? Donald Trump's position on transgender rights is incoherent, not \"nuanced\" VOX \/\/ GERMAN LOPEZ The Washington Post picked an interesting word to describe Donald Trump's new position on legal protections for transgender people: \"nuanced.\" A better word, however, might be \"incoherent.\" Trans people are \"a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the population,\" Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be left to the states, most of which he said would \"make the right decisions.\" So he would rescind the Obama administration's guidelines telling federally funded schools to respect the rights of trans people, including their right to use a bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. In other words, Trump thinks trans people should be protected by the law, but he wants to take away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in public schools. Pressed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old mantra of \"states' rights.\" As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sense if there's something local and state governments can do better than the federal government, or if it would be too burdensome or unwieldy for the federal government to get involved. A good example of that: fire departments. There's really no reason to think a federal fire department would be particularly more effective in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some exceptions may apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income areas.) Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history and current experience make that very clear. ... We have seen how this plays out already - in the 1960s, when the federal government had to step in to force schools to stop discriminating against black people. It's one of the big reasons the Civil Rights Act passed in the first place. Similarly, the federal government passed Title IX in the 1970s after it became clear that states were failing to ensure equal opportunities for women in schools. Now the country is seeing the same kind of failure with trans people. For one, most states do not have explicit anti-discrimination protections for trans people in the workplace, housing, education, or public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public). So it's not explicitly illegal under most states' laws to fire, evict, or refuse service to someone entirely because she's trans. ... In fact, some states are actively discriminating against trans people. That's what North Carolina did when it passed a law that banned local nondiscrimination ordinances that include sexual orientation and gender identity, and banned trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. Some people might wonder why denying trans people access to the bathroom for their gender identity is discrimination. It's simple: Forcing trans people to use the bathroom that doesn't align with their gender identity acts as a reminder that, as far as society has come on some LGBTQ issues, it's still not completely willing to accept trans people and their identities - even if trans people pose no danger to anyone else . So to trans people, this is just another slight by society. And it's a slight most states allow - and that North Carolina explicitly embraced. This is why the Obama administration got involved. If the country believes that anti-LGBTQ discrimination should be illegal (and majorities do in every state ), but states aren't stopping that discrimination from happening, it makes sense for the federal government - which has historically done this when states fail - to intervene, especially in schools the federal government funds. That's exactly what happened.","label":0}
{"text":"From: Preston Maddock Sent: Thursday, April 28, 2016 3:29 PM To: Wei, Shu-Yen Subject: Future Trump Voter 'Outraged' With His Life Choices BuzzFeed has a good catch today. In a softball talk radio interview recently, Pat Toomey said it was \"outrageous\" that his political opponents would associate him with Donald Trump. That's about as logical as Donald Trump being offended that you'd assume his favorite color is gold. But the best part is Toomey is \"outraged\" over something he's doing himself. He's defended the Donald against criticisms ; he said he \"understands \" why Trump resonates; and over and over again, he's said he will support Trump if he becomes the nominee. In fact, literally 108 seconds after Toomey called it \"outrageous\" to tie him to his party's likely standard-bearer, he did it again : Asked what he thought about Trump being the nominee, Toomey said that the businessman's odds were \"improving\" and that he would support him in his campaign against Clinton...\"I intend to support the Republican nominee.\" BuzzFeed: Pat Toomey: \"Outrageous\" For Democratic Challenger To Tie Me To Trump Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said on Wednesday that it's \"outrageous\" for his Democratic opponent Katie McGinty to tie him to Donald Trump. Toomey, whose spot in the Senate is considered vulnerable, made the comment on the Dom Giordano Program after the host, imitating McGinty, said, \"Well, it's Pat Toomey and Donald Trump, that's what we're gonna run on, and that's a bigotry ticket.\" \"Yeah, that's pretty outrageous actually,\" Toomey replied. \"But Dom, you know how this presidential race has been unfolding. I supported Marco Rubio. He was my first choice. I still think he'd have been a great president and a great candidate. As of yesterday, we were down to three guys standing and I voted for Ted Cruz.\" \"They, you know, Katie McGinty may somehow try to tie me to Donald Trump. You know, fine. She can do whatever she's gonna feel she need to do. But the fact is, she is in lockstep with Hillary Clinton. She actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything,\" he said of his opponent, who became the Democratic nominee in the Senate race after defeating Joe Sestak in Tuesday's primary. Asked what he thought about Trump being the nominee, Toomey said that the businessman's odds were \"improving\" and that he would support him in his campaign against Clinton. \"Well, look, you know, obviously, it looks like his odds have been improving recently,\" Toomey said. \"Yesterday was an amazing\u2014I had a chance to go through the numbers outside of Pennsylvania. So he does not have this wrapped up yet and we could still have an open convention, but certainly he's in a very strong position. And look, I've said all along, I intend to support the Republican nominee. Donald Trump was not my first choice. He wasn't my second choice. But, you know, I don't want to see Hillary Clinton take this country further to the left, to make the terrible policy of President Obama permanent, which she would tend to do.\" Paid for by the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee. www.padems.com This email was sent to: WeiS@dnc.org If that is not your preferred email address, you can update your information here.

{"text":"Tim, Chris, I hope you're not right about the lack of warming lasting till about 2020. I'd rather hoped to see the earlier Met Office press release with Doug's paper that said something like - half the years to 2014 would exceed the warmest year currently on record, 1998! Still a way to go before 2014. I seem to be getting an email a week from skeptics saying where's the warming gone. I know the warming is on the decadal scale, but it would be nice to wear their smug grins away. Chris - I presume the Met Office continually monitor the weather forecasts. Maybe because I'm in my 50s, but the language used in the forecasts seems a bit over the top re the cold. Where I've been for the last 20 days (in Norfolk) it doesn't seem to have been as cold as the forecasts. I've just submitted a paper on the UHI for London - it is 1.6 deg C for the LWC. It comes out to 2.6 deg C for night-time minimums. The BBC forecasts has the countryside 5-6 deg C cooler than city centres on recent nights. The paper shows the UHI hasn't got any worse since 1901 (based on St James Park and Rothamsted). Cheers Phil At 09:34 05\/01\/2009, Tim Johns wrote: Dear Chris, cc: Doug Mike McCracken makes a fair point. I am no expert on the observational uncertainties in tropospheric SO2 emissions over the recent past, but it is certainly the case that the SRES A1B scenario (for instance) as seen by different integrated assessment models shows a range of possibilities. In fact this has been an issue for us in the ENSEMBLES project, since we have been running models with a new mitigation\/stabilization scenario \"E1\" (that has large emissions reductions relative to an A1B baseline, generated using the IMAGE IAM) and comparing it with A1B (the AR4 marker version, generated by a different IAM). The latter has a possibly unrealistic secondary SO2 emissions peak in the early 21st C - not present in the IMAGE E1 scenario, which has a steady decline in SO2 emissions from 2000. The A1B scenario as generated with IMAGE also show a decline rather than the secondary emissions peak, but I can't say for sure which is most likely to be \"realistic\". The impact of the two alternative SO2 emissions trajectories is quite marked though in terms of global temperature response in the first few decades of the 21st C (at least in our HadGEM2-AO simulations, reflecting actual aerosol forcings in that model plus some divergence in GHG forcing). Ironically, the E1-IMAGE scenario runs, although much cooler in the long term of course, are considerably warmer than A1B-AR4 for several decades! Also - relevant to your statement - A1B-AR4 runs show potential for a distinct lack of warming in the early 21st C, which I'm sure skeptics would love to see replicated in the real world... (See the attached plot for illustration but please don't circulate this any further as these are results in progress, not yet shared with other ENSEMBLES partners let alone published). We think the different short term warming responses are largely attributable to the different SO2 emissions trajectories. So far we've run two realisations of both the E1-IMAGE and A1B-AR4 scenarios with HadGEM2-AO, and other partners in ENSEMBLES are doing similar runs using other GCMs. Results will start to be analysed in a multi-model way in the next few months. CMIP5 (AR5) prescribes similar kinds of experiments, but the implementation details might well be different from ENSEMBLES experiments wrt scenarios and their SO2 emissions trajectories (I haven't studied the CMIP5 experiment fine print to that extent).

What is the situation likely to be for AR5 forcing, particularly anthropogenic aerosols. Are there any new estimates yet? Pareticularly, will there be a revision in time for the 2010 forecast? We do in the meantime have an explanation for the interannual variability of the last decade. However this fits well only when an underlying net GHG+aerosol warming of 0.15C per decade is fitted in the statistical models. In a sense the methods we use would automatically fit to a reduced net warming rate so Mike McCracken can be told that. In other words the method creates it own transient climate sensitivity for recent warming. But the forcing rate underlying the method nevertheless perhaps sits a bit uncomfortably with the absolute forcing figures we are using from AR4. However having said this, interestingly, the statistics and DePreSys are in remarkable harmony about the temperature of 2009. > > Any guidance welcome > > Chris > > > Prof. Chris Folland > Research Fellow, Seasonal to Decadal Forecasting (from 2 June 2008) > > Met Office Hadley Centre, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter, Devon EX1 3PB United Kingdom > Email: chris.folland@metoffice.gov.uk > Tel: +44 (0)1647 432978 > Fax: (in UK) 0870 900 5050 > (International) +44 (0)113 336 1072) > > Fellow of the Met Office > Hon.

But, I have one nagging question, and that is how much SO2\/sulfate is being generated by the rising emissions from China and India (I know that at least some plants are using desulfurization--but that antidotes are not an inventory). I worry that what the western nations did in the mid 20th century is going to be what the eastern nations do in the next few decades--go to tall stacks so that, for the near-term, \"dilution is the solution to pollution\". While I understand there are efforts to get much better inventories of CO2 emissions from these nations, when I asked a US EPA representative if their efforts were going to also inventory SO2 emissions (amount and height of emission), I was told they were not. So, it seems, the scientific uncertainty generated by not having good data from the mid-20th century is going to be repeated in the early 21st century (satellites may help on optical depth, but it would really help to know what is being emitted). > > That there is a large potential for a cooling influence is sort of evident in the IPCC figure about the present sulfate distribution--most is right over China, for example, suggesting that the emissions are near the surface--something also that is, so to speak, 'clear' from the very poor visibility and air quality in China and India. So, the quick, fast, cheap fix is to put the SO2 out through tall stacks. The cooling potential also seems quite large as the plume would go out over the ocean with its low albedo--and right where a lot of water vapor is evaporated, so maybe one pulls down the water vapor feedback a little and this amplifies the sulfate cooling influence. > > Now, I am not at all sure that having more tropospheric sulfate would be a bad idea as it would limit warming--I even have started suggesting that the least expensive and quickest geoengineering approach to limit global warming would be to enhance the sulfate loading--or at the very least we need to maintain the current sulfate cooling offset while we reduce CO2 emissions (and presumably therefore, SO2 emissions, unless we manage things) or we will get an extra bump of warming. Sure, a bit more acid deposition, but it is not harmful over the ocean (so we only\/mainly emit for trajectories heading out over the ocean) and the impacts of deposition may well be less that for global warming (will be a tough comparison, but likely worth looking at). Indeed, rather than go to stratospheric sulfate injections, I am leaning toward tropospheric, but only during periods when trajectories are heading over ocean and material won't get rained out for 10 days or so. > Would be an interesting issue to do research on--see what could be done. > > In any case, if the sulfate hypothesis is right, then your prediction of warming might end up being wrong. I think we have been too readily explaining the slow changes over past decade as a result of variability--that explanation is wearing thin. I would just suggest, as a backup to your prediction, that you also do some checking on the sulfate issue, just so you might have a quantified explanation in case the prediction is wrong. Otherwise, the Skeptics will be all over us--the world is really cooling, the models are no good, etc. And all this just as the US is about ready to get serious on the issue. > > We all, and you all in particular, need to be prepared. > > Best, Mike MacCracken > > > Researchers Say 2009 to Be One of Warmest Years on Record > > On December 30, climate scientists from the UK Met Office and the University of East Anglia projected 2009 will be one of the top five warmest years on record.

Whether you are looking for your dream job or trying to hire talented people, the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your IT talent solution today! I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a recent metaphor. I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open source worlds that I don't like or believe in. Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (\"Gnu's Not Unix\"), HURD (\"Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons\"), WINE (\"Wine Is Not an Emulator\"), even PHP (\"PHP Hypertext Processor\") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the Unix\/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff. So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of recursion and a final layer of metaphor. The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the metaphor in a perfect way. Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will remain mercifully nameless: We get enough America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here) from Belgium whining too! Followed by: ... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who would be able to replace him. ... and, in a later note on the topic ... Censorship is to be encouraged in a free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the government. Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some. Chris has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch. So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff. Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye out. Tony Steidler-Dennison GnomeTWEAK Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!

Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by CodeWeavers - CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin. A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, \" ... the leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development realm. CrossOver Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its release, Wine had taken a \"full system\" approach. Running Windows applications in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows applications: browser plugins. The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need covered. But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications offered by the CodeWeavers developers. Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want these apps to work. The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\\ drive on my machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight - the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the CrossOver program. I kept \"retry\"ing and, with some persistence, managed to get a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\\ drive and dropped the plugins into the \/home\/tony\/.netscape\/plugins and \/home\/tony\/.mozilla\/plugins directories. The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these browsers - \"Help\", \"About Plugins.\" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the \"Men In Black II\" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly. I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within a half-hour, I had all installed and tested. Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty strong given my previous troubles with Wine. I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless. Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I missed them until I started using them in Linux today. Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office package. Recommend It!

If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear decision as to how to configure each section. Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module. Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the telescope cameras were attached to this port. Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the BIOS. Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Times Magazine, \"The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama's Foreign-Policy Guru: How Ben Rhodes rewrote the rules of diplomacy for the digital age,\" by David Samuels: \"Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer's tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains who materialize in digital space, with their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials. \"He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama's foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president's will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. He doesn't think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power within a White House that has awarded itself vastly expanded authority over the operations of the American government, just as George Bush's and Bill Clinton's White Houses did.'\" SNEAK PEEKS -- \"Is Donald Trump 'The Steve Jobs of Politics?' Newt Gingrich thinks so,\" by Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Green with Kevin Cirilli and Jennifer Jacobs: Newt Gingrich says of Trump, \"He's been so creative, and he does things so differently, and he will be so dominant, that we have to figure out how we build around him ... This is one, singular person who is the Steve Jobs of modern politics. And he is going to drive the system.\" Gingrich also doesn't shoot down rumors he could be Trump's VP: \"given an invitation to end the speculation by issuing a Shermaneque denial, he replied, 'Nobody from Georgia issues Shermanesque statements.

People who think highly of Kushner, and those who don't, all talk about his impeccable manners. They say he never loses his temper, at least not in public. He's unfailingly polite.

He was 82. The former Utah Republican senator's 6-foot-6 lanky frame inevitably led to comparisons with Washington Irving's character Ichabod Crane.

{"text":"Just watched the revised animatic and wanted to share some thoughts...Mavis's \"issue\" of wondering if getting married will limit her opportunities in life is at odds with her issue the rest of the movie. I think it's misleading. In fact, all of the business before the wedding feels superfluous. The news of the wedding isn't the conflict in the movie. What if we open on the montage of Mavis and Johnny's wedding but make it into an opening titles sequence. Make it really fun and a bigger production\/musical number. Better if the first announcement of the movie is \"I'm pregnant\" and Mavis' heart to heart with him is about the pregnancy\/baby rather than getting married. Also I think it would be better if Mavis' question - \"you don't mind that he's humany\" and Drac's response \"monster, humany, unicorn\" was about the baby instead of Johnny. It's not totally clear whether Drac is preoccupied with Dennis being a vampire from the moment he's born or only once Johnny's parents suggest Mavis and Johnny should move to live with them? Is his issue that he wants a grandson who is a monster or that he's afraid of the consequences to his family if he isn't? Why is it good for Johnny to be in on Drac's plan to take Dennis away? Maybe it would be better if Drac hatches the plan with Frank since the monsters then help sell the idea to Mavis in the next scene anyway. Not sure we want to emphasize that Mavis and Johnny have lost their zing. Too many ideas. There's also an odd negative commentary on marriage that Mavis thinks she won't get to pursue her dreams if she gets married and then within a few years of having a baby their marriage has lost its zing. The beats of Drac and the monsters demonstrating their monster skills isn't funny enough yet. After each monster fails to be scary there has to be a bigger joke to button those beats otherwise they feel somewhat anticlimactic. It should be Drac, not Frank, who says at the end of Act 2 that they need to go see Vlad. After resisting for the whole of the second act we need to understand how desperate he is to decide to go to this extreme. ----boundary-LibPST-iamunique-1369549809_-_---","label":0}

Which line do I use? The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM (expand column width on Column A). Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4\/01. However, there could be $11K\/month going forward. The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP. Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.

Clinton FYI- This reporter has a 4pm deadline today. From: Fred Lucas Sent: Friday, May 13, 2016 1:54 PM To: DNC Press Subject: Question on Donald Trump's \"Enabler\" Attack on Sec. Clinton Hello. I just spoke to someone with DNC Press and following up. I am doing a freelance story for FoxNews.com about Donald Trump's attacks against Secretary Clinton as an \"enabler\" of President Clinton's alleged misconduct with women. In at least some cases, past news reports and information from Judicial Watch indicate that Ms. Clinton might have been involved in the political strategy to discredit some of the accusers -- both in allegations of misconduct but also claims of a consensual relationship. General questions: 1. I hoped the DNC could weigh in on the appropriateness of Trump attacking along these lines? 2. From your view, why shouldn't women voters take into account Secretary Clinton's past role in political strategy for responding to accusers of her husband? I would really appreciate any response you have. Thanks very much. Fred Lucas (703) 859-1836","label":0}

Natural Gas, boosted by winter chills, was the only energy market to close on the upside. Sentiment in Grains and Oilseeds was influenced by a decline in Soybeans, affected by South American weather patterns, the Argentina crisis and the Pakistan-India tensions. A bumper Brazilian crop kept the lid on Coffee, a late surge in Cocoa ran out of steam, Cotton ended lower on weak US consumption data, while Sugar rebounded on short-covering. A drop in lease rates took Silver down, Gold went nowhere, while Copper took a late hit. Cattle was firm and Bellies pumped up.

{"text":"Flagging this part from an interview that Sanders did with the SF Chronicle: \"What I am concerned about is that people in the Democratic Party even raise that as a spectacle. Why would you do that?\" Sanders told The Chronicle Wednesday. \"When we have the most grassroots campaign seen in a very long time - with no violence - and then people are suggesting that we will bring violence to the convention in Philadelphia. That's absurd. That's a political tactic.\" Without mentioning Wasserman Schultz or Boxer by name, Sanders said, \"Then you have people comparing us to Donald Trump? That's bad politics. What we are trying to do is bring people together. That some people booed and yelled and maybe acted inappropriately, we condemn that. But people do have the right to boo.\" In San Jose, Sanders spells out campaign differences with Clinton By Joe Garofoli Bernie Sanders laughed heartily Wednesday afternoon before taking the stage at his rally in San Jose, noting the differences in his California campaign activities compared with his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton. Sanders scheduled two Bay Area rallies Wednesday - he also had a rally in Vallejo Wednesday evening and in between the two made an unannounced stop to join a boisterous crowd of hotel and restaurant employees in San Francisco demanding the right to unionize. Clinton or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, will headline four high-dollar fundraisers in the Bay Area next week. All the events are private and cost from $250 to $27,000 a ticket. \"Ha, ha, ha! That says everything about the difference,\" Sanders told The Chronicle Wednesday. \"Our goal - and I don't know if we'll achieve it - is to talk to 200,000 people in California in rallies like this until June 7\" - the date of the California primary election. \"If you want a candidate who is out working and speaking with people rather than hanging out raising money from millionaires, I think the choice is pretty clear,\" the Vermont senator said. While fundraising stops will be part of the Clintons' next trip to the state, they will also be making several public appearances - as they have also done during recent stops. Hillary Clinton did make public appearances at rallies in Oakland and East Los Angeles during a campaign swing earlier this month. And Bill Clinton headlined public events in San Diego and Los Angeles earlier this month, too. Bill Clinton is expected to be at a rally in San Diego on Saturday when he swings through California for several days starting this weekend, with more public events expected to be on his schedule. Hillary Clinton is also expected to do multiple public events on her next trip through California next week. Hillary for California campaign director Buffy Wicks responded that both Clintons \" have held events across the state this month where they've talked to many Californians about the issues on their minds and they look forward to returning this weekend and next week.\" A practical purpose For the Sanders campaign, Wednesday's rallies served a practical purpose. Before the candidate appeared, supporter Wrenn Bunker Koesters urged the crowd from the stage to text the word \"volunteer\" to a campaign number. That inspired Esdras Ortega to text his desire to volunteer. The rally was the first political event the 20-year-old De Anza College student had ever attended. \"I just wanted to come here, hear what he said and pick up a vibe on his speeches and see what people were cheering for and getting excited about,\" Ortega said. \"This gets me psyched up to volunteer.\" It has paid similar dividends nationally. Of people who have attended Sanders' campaign rallies or town meetings, 67 percent have volunteered and 40 percent of them donated money, Sanders campaign digital director Kenneth Pennington said Wednesday. The public perception is palpable, too, analysts say. \"When you raise money like that, you are more accountable to the public at large rather than a small group of donors,\" said Daniel G. Newman, co-founder of Maplight, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes the role of money in politics. Newman pointed out that both Clinton and Sanders have promised to do all they could to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that paved the way for unlimited campaign contributions. During Wednesday's rally before 5,500 people at the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds in San Jose, Sanders - often in a hoarse voice - stuck to his stump speech, a critique of how the wealthy have a death grip on America's political and economic systems. He didn't attack Clinton directly and saved some of his most pointed jabs for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. 'That will not happen' \"I know that there are many people who are concerned that Donald Trump may become president of the United States. That will not happen,\" Sanders said, pointing to how he leads Trump in many national polls. \"More important, I believe the American people will reject the basic tenets of what Donald Trump stands for.\" Sanders pointed to Nevada casino magnate Sheldon Adelson saying last week he would endorse Trump. \"When you have billionaires supporting billionaires, that's oligarchy,\" the candidate said. Sanders steered into a California topic when he addressed a matter likely to be before state voters this fall: legalizing cannabis for adult recreational use. \"If I lived in California I would vote yes to legalize marijuana,\" Sanders said at the rally, drawing huge cheers. After he left San Jose, Sanders appeared about 4:30 p.m. in the plaza at 101 California near the Le Meridien Hotel to support workers trying to organize there and spoke for about five minutes to a crowd of about 500 people. This time he veered in a very San Francisco issue: homelessness. \"Just been in San Francisco for a few hours, and it's stunning to see people sleeping out in the street,\" he said. Following his speech, he waded into the crowd to shake hands with supporters before heading to the evening rally in Vallejo. At Vallejo's Waterfront Park, Sanders continued hammering on the nation's wealth inequality while speaking for an hour before a crowd organizers estimated at 5,000 people. And he continued to be boundlessly optimistic about his chances, saying that after winning the Oregon primary Tuesday, \"I think we're going to sweep the West Coast.\" Like he did in San Jose, Sanders barely mentioned Clinton and focused his attacks on Trump as a billionaire who, if elected, would perpetuate an economic system that's rigged against middle- and low-income Americans. In an interview before his San Jose speech, Sanders reacted strongly to criticism of events at the Nevada Democratic Convention over the weekend. His supporters said party organizers had changed the rules of the convention to block them and give an advantage to Clinton. They reacted by causing disruption and threatening the state party chairwoman. But Sanders said concerns about \"violence\" were overblown and pointed out that \"it was a room filled with police officers and nobody was arrested.\" Dems criticize campaign Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the reaction by the Sanders campaign to the Nevada incident \"anything but acceptable,\" and California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who was in Nevada, complained of being booed and said she had been concerned for her safety. Other party leaders worried it could be a preview of chaos at the national convention in July in Philadelphia should Sanders not win the nomination. \"What I am concerned about is that people in the Democratic Party even raise that as a spectacle. Why would you do that?\" Sanders told The Chronicle Wednesday. \"When we have the most grassroots campaign seen in a very long time - with no violence - and then people are suggesting that we will bring violence to the convention in Philadelphia. That's absurd. That's a political tactic.\" Without mentioning Wasserman Schultz or Boxer by name, Sanders said, \"Then you have people comparing us to Donald Trump? That's bad politics. What we are trying to do is bring people together. That some people booed and yelled and maybe acted inappropriately, we condemn that. But people do have the right to boo.\" Sanders also pressed for Clinton to fulfill her promise to debate in California. Fox News extended an invitation Wednesday to both campaigns to debate in California and the Sanders campaign noted that The Chronicle has offered to co-host a debate. While the odds remain long for Sanders to capture the Democratic nomination, Matthew Finkelstein, a Vallejo resident wearing a blue Bernie-themed yarmulke to the rally in his city, remained hopeful. \"In politics, anything can happen. Sometimes a moment comes together perfectly and a star goes supernova,\" Finkelstein said. \"Whether or not Bernie wins this contest or he doesn't, this movement is coming.\" -- Walter Garcia Western Regional Press Secretary Democratic National Committee (DNC) Email: GarciaW@dnc.org Twitter: @WalterGarcia231 [SigDems]","label":0}

{"text":"From: Clifford, Tyler (CBC) Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 2:46 PM Subject: PRESS RELEASE: Remarks by CBC Chairman G. K. Butterfield At Press Conference Unveiling New GAO Report on Modern-Day Segregation in Public Schools NEWS RELEASE For Immediate Release May 17, 2016 Remarks by CBC Chairman G. K. Butterfield At Press Conference Unveiling New GAO Report on Modern-Day Segregation in Public Schools WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, CBC Chairman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) gave remarks at a press conference to commemorate the 62nd Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education and unveil a new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on contemporary racial and socioeconomic segregation and disparities in K-12 public schools. Committee on Education and the Workforce Ranking Member Bobby Scott (VA-03) and Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (MI-03), along with retired Congressman George Miller, first requested this report in May 2014 to identify actions needed to reduce segregation and disparities in public schools. The GAO gathered data from the U.S. Department of Education and found that inequities in public schools are the result of race, poverty, and housing segregation patterns. Remarks by CBC Chairman Butterfield, as prepared for delivery, follow: 62 years ago today the Supreme Court took a monumental step to correct the precedent established in Plessy v. Ferguson of \"separate but equal.\" The landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision struck Plessy down and held that \"separate was inherently unequal.\" At that time, segregation was the law and subjected generations of students of color to inferior education, dilapidated facilities, and significantly reduced resources in order to fulfill a racist and oppressive agenda. After the Brown v. Board decision, it took years of resistance and federal action to integrate schools. But now six decades later, we have seen public schools seemingly regress back to the segregated state we saw during the Jim Crow era. Overt racism has now turned to institutional racism creating structural barriers that have countered the positive impact of the Brown v. Board decision. Racial and socioeconomic segregation in public schools has nearly doubled since 2000 and has occurred primarily in schools where more than 75 percent of the students are Black or Hispanic and eligible for free or reduced lunch. What's more alarming is that three out of five high-poverty schools have high concentrations of students of color. Folks, there is a problem with our education system and we need to take immediate action to restore our promise to provide equal access to educational opportunity. The CBC has been fighting to address not only the racial wealth gap, but also the achievement and opportunity gaps that continue to widen. These gaps pose dire economic consequences for communities of color-we must work to counter these disparities and also to address the school-to-prison pipeline which disproportionately affects African American students. Friends, we have work to do. I want to thank my colleagues Ranking Member John Conyers and Ranking Member Bobby Scott for their leadership in calling for this GAO report. It will require deliberate decisions and efforts to achieve true equity in education and equality for all students in our schools. I call on my colleagues in the House and the Senate to join us in our efforts to create better schools for our youth. # # # Since its establishment in 1971, Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) have joined together to empower America's neglected citizens and address their legislative concerns. For more than 40 years, the CBC has consistently been the voice for people of color and vulnerable communities in Congress and has been committed to utilizing the full Constitutional power and statutory authority of the United States government to ensure that all U.S. citizens have an opportunity to achieve the American Dream.

{"text":"These are talking points for our messaging call at 1:30p. These are the standard talking points that we have used in different press calls and reporter meetings with Pratt. Main Talking Points --In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby vs. Holder. --Basically, states and localities with a history of discriminatory voting practices don't need to seek approval from the U.S. Justice Department in order to change their electoral laws. --Since then, we've seen a number of states pass anti-voter laws designed to limit access to the polls. Whether it's implementing restrictive photo ID laws, rolling back early voting, eliminating same-day registration, or changing polling locations without notifying voters, these types of tactics make it harder to vote. --2016 is a major test for these types of laws. This will be the first presidential election since the Voting Rights Act was passed where we don't have the full protections of the VRA. --The most important, topline message we need to share is this: --This is nothing more than a partisan ploy to sway elections in the GOP's favor. --Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country are passing restrictive voting laws, claiming they fight voter fraud, while making it harder for groups that tend to vote Democratic - women, minorities, and students - to cast their ballots. --When we limit the ways that people can vote, we are hurting the low-wage workers with two jobs, the single mother who goes to work early each morning and picks up her children late at night, and the widower without a car who relies on his grown children to get to the polls. --The Republicans are on-the-record about this: --Former Senator Jim DeMint, who now leads the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation, recently admitted that voter ID laws help elect \"more conservative candidates.\" --In April, a Wisconsin Congressman bragged to reporters that the state's restrictive photo ID law would help the GOP defeat Democrats. --Four years ago, the Pennsylvania Republican House Leader announced that the state's restrictive photo ID law was 'gonna allow Governor Romney to win the State of Pennsylvania.' --And the same group of anti-voting rights activists who backed Evenwell also backed efforts to gut the Voting Rights Act. --We also know that voter impersonation - the type of fraud that photo IDs are supposed to eliminate - is effectively non-existent. A comprehensive investigation of voter impersonation found only 31 credible incidents out of one billion ballots cast from 2000 through 2014. --So when you look at all of the evidence, it should be clear that Republicans are looking for a solution to an imaginary problem. --We have to make this case for reporters, and we have to call the GOP out for their tactics.

{"text":"Trump Campaign Corresponded With Its White Nationalist Delegate Long After \"Database Error\" On Tuesday, Mother Jones broke the story that the Trump campaign had selected William Johnson, a prominent white nationalist leader, as a California delegate. The Trump campaign responded with the following statement: Yesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign's list in February 2016. Reached again by Mother Jones late Tuesday, Johnson said he would resign as a delegate if asked to do so by the campaign. \"I accept Trump's explanation,\" he said, regarding the statement. \"I don't want to gainsay the Trump campaign. If I am not removed from the database, I will resign.\" Although the Trump campaign blamed a \"database error\" for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago. Trump's California delegate coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino, sent Johnson a congratulatory email on Monday, and when he asked for clarification about how to send his completed pledge form back to the campaign, she replied. Here is the email exchange (with the personal contact information redacted by Mother Jones): [ Mother Jones also has a copy of the pledge form discussed in the email exchange, which Johnson signed and sent to the Trump campaign on Monday. You can see his pledge here . ________________________________ From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 4:04 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Mother Jones: Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California h\/t Joel We have a fair amount on William Johnson and his Pro-Trump American National Super PAC running robocalls in Iowa Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California On Monday evening, California's secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the Trump campaign for the upcoming Republican presidential primary in the state. Trump's slate includes William Johnson, one of the country's most prominent white nationalists. Johnson applied to the Trump campaign to be a delegate. He was accepted on Monday. In order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign: \"I, William Johnson, endorse Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States. I pledge to cast ALL of my ballots to elect Donald J. Trump on every round of balloting at the 2016 Republican National Convention so that we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" After he signed, the Trump campaign added his name to the list of 169 delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state. Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that \"exists to represent the political interests of White Americans\" and aims to preserve \"the customs and heritage of the European American people.\" The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is \"arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,\" according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups. Johnson got the news that he had been selected by Trump in a congratulatory email sent to him by the campaign's California Delegate Coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino. \"I just hope to show how I can be mainstream and have these views,\" Johnson tellsMother Jones. \"I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody.\" Johnson says that in his application to be a GOP delegate for Trump he disclosed multiple details about his background and activism, though he did not specifically use the term \"white nationalist.\" The Trump campaign and Lagomarsino did not respond to requests for comment. Whether or not Johnson was vetted by the Trump campaign, the GOP front-runner would have a hard time claiming ignorance of Johnson's extreme views: Johnson has gained notice during the presidential primary for funding pro-Trump robocalls that convey a white nationalist message. \"The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called 'racist,'\" Johnson says in one robocall pushed out to residential landlines in Vermont and Minnesota. \"\u2026Donald Trump is not racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don't vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\" Armed with cash from affluent donors and staffed by what the movement considers to be its top thinkers, the AFP now dedicates most of its resources to supporting Trump\u2014and for good reason: Johnson claims the AFP's pro-Trump robocalls, which have delivered Johnson's personal cellphone number to voters in seven states, have helped the party find hundreds of new members. \"[Trump] is allowing us to talk about things we've not been able to talk about,\" Johnson says. \"So even if he is not elected, he has achieved great things.\" On numerous occasions, Trump has failed to forcefully repudiate this sort of support. After being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in August last year, Trump simply told Bloomberg News, \"I don't need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn't want his endorsement. I don't need anybody's endorsement.\" Asked in February about the robocalls, which are funded by Johnson through a super-PAC, a Trump spokeswoman would only tell CNN that the candidate had \"disavowed all super-PACs offering their support.\" The SPLC's Potok argues that Trump has \"legitimized and mainstreamed hate\" in ways we haven't seen since the days of George Wallace. Though nobody can say for sure how many people belong to America's largest hate groups, the SPLC has found that the number of such groups grew by 14 percent in 2015, reversing years of declines. Potok worries that Trump could fuel the spread of the AFP's ideas for years to come. Johnson is a corporate lawyer who grows persimmons and raises chickens at his 67-acre \"ranch\" in a Los Angeles suburb. When I met him recently outside his law office in downtown LA's World Trade Center, he was in high spirits. He suggested brightly that we walk downstairs to get lunch at a nearby Korean restaurant. As we sat next to a table of immaculately coiffed Korean Air flight attendants, I mentioned that some might find it surprising that a guy who wrote a book advocating the creation of an all-white ethno-state was eating a plate of bulgogi beef with kimchee. \"Koreans don't have to make Korean food,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"One of the best Chinese restaurants I went to in the Bay Area is owned by a Mormon and cooked by a Mormon. Really great Chinese food.\" Short, graying, and 61 years old, Johnson favors pressed white shirts and bookish black-framed glasses. He grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods in Arizona and Oregon before moving to Japan in 1974 to study the language. It was there that locals engaged him in \"open\" discussions about differences between the races, and he came to see America's European heritage as its biggest\u2014and most vulnerable\u2014asset. (This trajectory is not uncommon: Jared Taylor, head of the white nationalist group American Renaissance, also speaks fluent Japanese, and Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler became a white supremacist while immersed in the caste system in India.) In 1985, Johnson published, under a pseudonym, Amendment to the Constitution: Averting the Decline and Fall of America, a book calling for the abolition of the 14th and 15th Amendments and the deportation of all nonwhites. He tried to sound a practical tone, allowing, for instance, that African Americans should receive \"a rich dowry to enable them to prosper in their homeland.\" The book was a hit on the talk show circuit, and Johnson suddenly found himself appearing on television alongside neo-Nazi skinheads and Klansmen. By 1989, his notoriety and clean-cut appeal convinced a group of white nationalists in Wyoming to tap him to run for Dick Cheney's vacant congressional seat. He garnered a flurry of press coverage when he earned enough signatures to qualify for the ballot; around the same time, the building housing his California law office was bombed. Johnson says the FBI accused him of detonating it himself in a bid for more press. (The bureau declined to comment.) Twenty years later, after unsuccessfully running for various other offices, Johnson became the head of the American Freedom Party (then known as American Third Position), at the request of a group of Southern California skinheads. Johnson's post was supposed to be temporary: \"The skinheads thought I was too extreme to run the organization,\" he explained. But they were the ones who ended up dropping out, replaced by what has become a sort of white nationalist brain trust: Party leaders now include a former Reagan administration appointee and a professor emeritus at California State University-Long Beach. After our Korean lunch, Johnson rushed back up to his office to host the latest episode of For God and Country, a Christian AM talk show currently broadcast in California, Louisiana, and Texas. His Filipino American co-host, the Rev. Ronald Tan, nodded approvingly as Johnson praised Trump on the air for \"busting up the concept of political correctness.\" The show allows Johnson to push a Trump-centric version of white nationalism to a potentially receptive audience\u2014up to a point. Several radio stations in Iowa recently canceled the program out of objection to its content. During a commercial break, Johnson fidgeted. \"Are you going to quote any more Scriptures?\" he asked Tan nervously. \"Has the station said that we're not Christian enough?\" Back on the air, Tan pivoted to 1 Samuel 16, comparing Trump to King David. In addition to promoting Trump on the radio and over the phone, the AFP streams a podcast called the Daily Trump Phenomenon Hour. It has set up a \"political harassment hotline\" for Trump supporters who wish to consult with an attorney about being attacked or verbally abused by anti-Trump protesters. Johnson has personally spent $30,000 the Trump promotions, including $18,000 for the party. The robocalls, the radio show, and the \"harassment hotline\" were all things that Johnson mentioned in his application to become a Trump delegate. He specifically cited an anti-Romney robocall commissioned in Utah this past March, which begins, in part, \"My name is William Johnson. I am a farmer and a white nationalist.\" After wrapping up the radio show, Johnson led me through his office, where a brush-painted screen hangs alongside shelves stacked with Japanese books and dictionaries. Many of his legal clients, it turns out, are foreigners who speak English as a second language. Yet Johnson says he sees no problem with Trump's isolationist foreign policy, even if it hurts his business\u2014ideally, he'd like to give up his practice and serve as Trump's secretary of agriculture. We ended up in a mirrored conference room to meet with three AFP sympathizers, two middle-aged women and a young man. They talked about how Trump had enabled a new kind of \"honest discourse,\" how he wasn't a racist but a \"racialist,\" and how he had left them feeling \"emancipated.\" Johnson also now finds it easier to be himself: \"For many, many years, when I would say these things, other white people would call me names: 'Oh, you're a hatemonger, you're a Nazi, you're like Hitler,'\" he confessed. \"Now they come in and say, 'Oh, you're like Donald Trump.'\"","label":0}

Kidsave's Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older child. In 1999 and 2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program. The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or family-like environments. We are looking for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp program happen for these 250 children. As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the money to bring these children here and find them families. Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948 or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's Kidsave program. Find Out how to Join The Downtown Club May 29 & 30!

{"text":"NYT saying that he will lay-off \"hundreds\" of staff Bernie Sanders to Cut Hundreds of Staff Members and Turn to California NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ YAMICHE ALCINDOR Senator Bernie Sanders is planning to lay off \"hundreds\" of campaign staffers across the country and focus much of his remaining effort on winning California, he said in an interview Wednesday. The Vermont senator revealed the changes a day after losing four of the five states that voted Tuesday and falling further behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Despite the changes, Mr. Sanders said he would remain in the race through the party's summer convention and stressed that he hoped to bring staff members back on board if his political fortunes improved. \"We want to win as many delegates as we can, so we do not need workers now in states around country,\" Mr. Sanders said in the interview. \"We don't need people right now in Connecticut. That election is over. We don't need them in Maryland. So what we are going to do is allocate our resources to the 14 contests that remain, and that means that we are going to be cutting back on staff.\" When asked how many people would be let go, Mr. Sanders didn't give an exact number but did say many people would be affected. \"It will be hundreds of staff members,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"We have had a very large staff, which was designed to deal with 50 states in this country; 40 of the states are now behind us. So we have had a great staff, great people.\" He added that he hoped to work with the people his campaign is letting go in the future. \"If we win this, every one of those great people who have helped us get this far, they will be rehired,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"But right now, we have to use all of the resources we have and focus them on the remaining states.\" Mr. Sanders said he planned to move a number of staff members to California, where he hoped to hold rallies for \"hundreds of thousands\" of people in cities across that state. \"California will have the most staff,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"Symbolically and in terms of delegates, if we can win the largest state in this country, that will send a real message to the American people and to the delegates that this is a campaign that is moving in the direction it should.\" From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Wednesday, April 27, 2016 4:17 PM To: Comm_D Subject: FLAG: Sanders laying off staff TERRE HAUTE, Ind. - Bernie Sanders' campaign started letting field staffers go on Wednesday, hours after five states in the Northeast voted and the Vermont senator fell further behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination, five people familiar with the situation told POLITICO. The extent of the cuts are unclear, but staffers who were working in states that voted Tuesday were told to look elsewhere for work rather than continue onto the next voting states, according to people close to the campaign. Story Continued Below \"Wer'e 80 percent of the way through the caucuses and primaries and we make adjustments as we go along. This is a process that we've done before of right-sizing the campaign as we move through the calendar,\" said Sanders' campaign communications director Michael Briggs. While Sanders has raised large amounts of money online, and started April with $17 million according to his most recent Federal Election Commission report, he has also spent at a very high rate, including $46 million in March. It is unclear how much money his campaign currently has on hand. Sanders has had a large field organizing presence all over the country, and Wednesday's cuts are the first significant scaling back of his campaign apparatus now that the majority of states have voted in the primary. While he insisted to an Indiana crowd on Wednesday that he is still in the race to win it, he has also suggested that he is aiming to influence the Democratic platform if Clinton is the candidate. Still, Sanders is likely to win a handful of states in May, and he is competing heavily in California and Indiana.

{"text":"TeenScreen was conceived as a clever way to identify, label and treat millions of America's children. It was formed and forwarded with drug company blood money. Early on, I'm sure they thought it would be a piece of cake, that nobody would stand in their way. Methinks they were wrong. The public is getting the truth about TeenScreen, with force and in volume. Check out the latest. And let me know if you want to write some letters. Doyle anti_psych@yahoo.com FROM THE BATTLE CREEK (MICHIGAN) ENQUIRER: ON03\/604080313\/1014 TeenScreen turns kids into mental patients TeenScreen director Leslie McGuire's less-than-candid letter (\"Screening can help ID those at risk of suicide,\" April 6) looks to me like trolling to turn school children into mental patients. First off, TeenScreen seldom practices voluntary mental health screening. It uses a passive consent form that parents have to sign to opt out if they do not want their child screened for depression and other mental illnesses. If they do not receive or do not return the form, their child is screened. TeenScreen is currently under suit in Indiana for just this practice. The screening questions result in many false positives. If your child is thought to have depression, they will be put on antidepressants which are now positively linked to violence and suicide. No scientific or medical test will be administered in the diagnosis. It is an entirely verbal and subjective assessment often resulting in a wrong diagnosis. In December 2004 the FDA issued a \"black box\" warning on antidepressants to alert the public to the risk of suicidality caused by these drugs. This is the most serious type of warning in prescription drug labeling. The next step would be suspending antidepressants entirely. The fact that many TeenScreen executives have direct ties to pharmaceutical companies tells me why this program is being pushed heavily in schools. Statistics from the CDC Web site point out that teen suicide is on the decline over the last 20 years yet Ms. McGuire's letter would have us believe there is an epidemic going on. If there is, it is an epidemic of kids on dangerous psychiatric drugs. Eight of the last 13 school shootings in America were committed by children under the influence of psychiatric drugs. This includes Columbine and Red Lake, Minn. Parents need to do their homework about TeenScreen. Ernest Ryan Temperance FROM THE TUCSON CITIZEN no link available Criminal pharmaceuticals Re: the Friday article \"Kids' anti-psych drug use soars\": This is a lethal combination for our youth: \u00b7 Uneducated, working parents who just want to relax a bit and trust what the \"shrink\" recommends for their uncontrollable child. \u00b7 A pseudo-scientist (psychiatrist) who wants full control, inventing \"mental illnesses\" that aren't evidenced in any tissue and utilizing any brutal method to treat them, such as lobotomy, shock treatment or drugs with side effects such as diabetes, high cholesterol, suicide, etc. \u00b7 Gigantic pharmaceutical companies, extraordinarily knowledgeable in marketing techniques, with very low morals, that hook up with these shrinks and, through lobbying in Congress, help keep control of mental health in the hands of these pseudo-scientists, as long as sales of their products continue increasing and are prescribed by the shrinks and promoted in programs such as TeenScreen despite their harmful effects. \u00b7 An uneducated society fed false data since Freud and accepting these charlatans without ever seeing bona fide results.

Final result: A fooled, drugged, controlled society in the hands of pseudo-scientists and immoral marketeers, a society that is decaying and whose children, whose future, whose health and life are undermined and endangered.

From: Walker, Eric Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 7:25 PM To: Jefferson, Deshundra; Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Walsh, Tom Subject: RE: Please read: Talking Points for Rights Restoration I think these TPs are great. I would add 2 things. First thing I would add is to discuss the racist roots of this policy. These quotes are really sickening, and I think it will advance our cause if we can put Republicans on the side of defending this sentiment. From NYT Op-Ed : The political leaders who amended Virginia's constitution in 1902 to make disenfranchisement laws even more onerous - and to write black people out of civic life - said openly that they were doing so to \"eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this State in less than five years, so that in no single county of the Commonwealth will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in affairs of government.\" A leading Virginia politician said plainly at the time that the new laws were intended to \"discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the limitations of the Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate.\" Second - I would add that Dems will remain vigilant, especially in this election. We have a dual threat: no VRA, and a racist Republican nominee who is willing to take the low road and do whatever it takes to destroy those who stand in the way of his personal ambition. If he casually slurs ethnic groups and calls on BLM protestors to be \"roughed up\" what do you think he will do when he sees communities of color as the obstacle to him gaining power? From: Jefferson, Deshundra Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 6:53 PM To: Miranda, Luis; Walker, Eric; Paustenbach, Mark; Walsh, Tom Subject: Please read: Talking Points for Rights Restoration Deshundra Jefferson, DNC Spokesperson Thank you for joining us for this on-the-record call. Last month, Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order restoring voting rights for more than 200,000 people with felony convictions. The Governor's actions overturned a lingering vestige of the Jim Crow laws that kept African Americans from voting, but Virginia Republicans are accusing him of \"political opportunism.\" It is deeply disturbing that as our nation moves forward, one of the country's major political parties is attempting to drag us backward. We are pleased to welcome the Assistant Democratic Leader and civil rights activist Representative Jim Clyburn, Representative Bobby Scott, and Terry Garrett, to this call. I would now like to turn the call over to the Assistant Leader who has long been on the forefront of the fight for civil and voting rights. Talking Points for Assistant Democratic Leader Rep. Jim Clyburn * The right to vote is the cornerstone of democracy and the foundation upon which all other rights are built. * The Voting Rights Act has been the single most important tool to protect the right to vote over the last half century until Shelby County v. Holder opened the door for underhanded schemes that reduced electoral power in communities of color. * We see that clearly in states like North Carolina where one bad law reversed an entire generation of electoral progress. * In Arizona, the DNC, the DSCC, the Arizona Democratic Party, and impacted voters took the extraordinary step of suing the state of to correct the problems that led to five-hour lines during the presidential primary. * Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country are passing restrictive voting laws, under the guise of fighting voter fraud, but they have only made it harder for groups that tend to vote Democratic - people of color, women, and students - to cast their ballots. * Governor McAuliffe are doing the opposite, they are trying to make it easier to vote but Virginia Republicans are resistant to his attempts to make the Commonwealth a more fair, and inclusive society. * Virginia's felony disenfranchisement law was passed to keep African-Americans from gaining political power. * Make no mistake - the GOP seems to believe their path to victory lies in restricting access to the polls. So if you ask me, the real political opportunism lies with the Republican Party. * It's time to close the door on these types of laws but the Republican Party is dead sent on being on the wrong side of history. * I have stood on the front lines of the fight for civil rights, and I applaud Governor McAuliffe for doing the right thing. * Thank you for joining us today, and I am turning the call over my friend and colleague, Representative Bobby Scott. Talking Points for Representative Bobby Scott * Thank you, Congressman. It was a pleasure to have you join this call. * The Virginia Republicans need to end their campaign of misinformation. * Virginia Republicans have been desperately trying to paint Governor McAuliffe's executive order as \"political opportunism,\" in order to divert attention from their defense of an overtly racist law. * Yesterday, the Governor's Office released a demographic breakdown of the 200,000 people whose voting rights will now be restored. * What stood out for me was that 45 percent of disenfranchised voters are African-Americans even though blacks only account for 19.4 percent of the Commonwealth's entire population. * That clearly illustrates that the impact of this law was most keenly felt by African-Americans. * Governor McAuliffe's actions are consistent with just about every other state in the Union. There's nothing partisan, unusual or suspect about restoring voting rights for people who have paid their debt to society. * Denying them that right is partisan. Denying them that right is unusual given that Virginia is only one of four states that requires people with felony convictions to petition the Governor to have their voting rights restored. And denying that right is suspect given the origins of the felony disenfranchisement laws. * Virginia Republicans are using every scare tactic they can dream up to attack the Governor's motivations. * They claim that this gives license to rapists and murders to sit on juries, while ignoring the fact that 79 percent of the people whose rights were restored had non-violent felonies. * They also claim that this is a partisan ploy that will give Democrats the edge in November. If that's truly the case, then Republicans have been coasting into office all these years by limiting Democratic turnout. * I have a challenge for the Republican Party of Virginia. I want them to prove that they are not motivated by political opportunism by repealing the Commonwealth's restrictive photo ID law, by implementing early voting, and to fully fund the replacement of our aging voting equipment. * I challenge them to break down the unnecessary barriers that were erected to keep people of color away from the polls. If they are serious about protecting the integrity of our democracy then they should be willing to work with Democrats at the congressional level to restore the critical protections of the Voting Rights Act.

And it wasn't just actors who were handily sliced to pieces. It was everyone who works in the motion picture industry. \u00c2 To quote Ms. DeGeneres \"movies are not the most important thing in the world\u2026.the most important thing in life is love and family and if people don't have those things they get into show business\". Or her quip that over 1400 films had been made by those in attendance but they'd gone \"to a total of six years of college\" (singling out Amy Adams who hadn't gone to college) and the slice at Bruce Dern (and everyone in attendance) whose grandfather was the governor of Utah, his uncle a Pulitzer Prize winning poet and his godmother was Eleanor Roosevelt and to quote Ms. Degeneres \"and here you are tonight\u2026what went wrong?\" \u00c2 What went wrong was putting a host who ruthlessly denigrated the integrity of the brilliant and hard working professionals of the motion picture industry. And I don't think it was the intention of the men and women who put on the first Academy Awards in the Blossom Room of the Roosevelt Hotel in 1929 to rip at the heart of their chosen profession.\u00c2 \u00c2 With a beautiful tribute to The Wizard of Oz I guess it was Ms. DeGeneres' intention to pull the curtain back on the Wizards of the motion picture industry. And, yes it's true, that the Wizard of Oz was 'just a man' but he was also the one who brought magic and mystery to Emerald City and, ultimately, granted wishes by giving Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal, the Tin Man a heart-shaped pocket watch and offered to get Dorthy home in his hot air balloon. \u00c2 Congratulations on the great job your doing at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences but how about some writers and a host next year who frankly gives a damn about the professionals of the motion picture industry. \u00c2 Sincerely, \u00c2 CB 'Chris' McCarty \u00c2 Cc: Ron Meyer, Brad Grey, Robert Iger, Kevin Tsujihara, Rupert Murdoch, Amy Pascal, Michael Lynton, Mary McNamara, Tim Goodman \u00c2 \u00c2","label":0}

Bush Join Growing List of Conservatives Rebuking Trump as He Captures GOP Nomination Former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush Join Growing List of Conservatives Rebuking Trump as He Captures GOP Nomination On Tuesday, Donald Trump effectively captured the Republican nomination. Two days later, as Trump has repeatedly doubled down on his plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. and his support for mass deportation of immigrants , prominent activists, journalists, donors and elected officials in his own party continue to figure out what Hillary Clinton has argued all along: Donald Trump is too big a risk for America. Take a look at the growing group of prominent conservatives who are promising that they'll never vote for Trump: Texas Tribune: Bush 41, 43 Have No Plans to Endorse Trump : \"For the first time since his own presidency, George H.W. Bush is planning to stay silent in the race for the Oval Office \u2014 and the younger former president Bush plans to stay silent as well. Bush 41, who enthusiastically endorsed every Republican nominee for the last five election cycles, will stay out of the campaign process this time. He does not have plans to endorse presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.\" Nevada Senator Dean Heller : \"I vehemently oppose our nominee and some of the comments and issues he brought up during the campaign\" Arizon Senator Jeff Flake : \"@seungminkim: .@JeffFlake on if he could support Trump: \"I can't see how I can if he continues to advocate those policies.\" (such as Muslim bans + wall)\" Rep. Louie Gohmert [R-TX] : \"Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert balked at backing Trump without an apology for his rhetoric toward Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and warned that Trump could cost Republicans a majority in Congress. \"I had no fear of losing the House until I saw this weekend the commercial against Sen. John Boozman in Arkansas. They run quote after quote from Donald Trump's mouth,\" Gohmert told Fox Business Network. \"This is a dangerous time.\"\" Rep. Ann Wagner [R-MO] : \"A candidate has to earn my vote. And thus far, Donald Trump has not.\" Rep. Justin Amash [R-MI] : \"U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, the Grand Rapids area Republican who first endorsed Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul and then Cruz for the GOP nomination, has said he would not vote for Trump.\" New Hampshire State Rep.

Bush : \"Said he's actually voting for Hillary Clinton, with whom he worked when she was U.S. senator for New York. \"She can work with people on the opposite side of the political aisle,\" he said.\" Elliott Abrams, former foreign policy advisor for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush : \"won't be voting for Trump\" Andy Card, former White House Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush : \"I'd probably write in a name.\" CatholicVote : \"We will not endorse Donald Trump for President at this time.\" New York Times: With Donald Trump in Charge, Republicans Have a Day of Reckoning : \"Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet; others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or \"too busy\" to email, call or release a statement.\" Bloomberg: Big-Spending Fracking Family Behind Cruz Won't Back Trump : \"Add the conservative Wilks family of Texas, among the biggest spenders in the presidential race so far, to the list of donors who won't support Donald Trump in the general election.\" Politico: The [GOP] donor class remains unswayed : \"Republican donors want nothing to do with Donald Trump [...] in interviews with more than a dozen major GOP funders, not one on Wednesday would commit to donating to Trump. Washington Examiner: Conservative national security experts vow to keep fighting against Trump : \"Conservative national security experts who vowed not to support Donald Trump are saying nothing has changed now that he is the presumptive nominee. \"When I said 'never Trump,' I meant it,\" Colin Dueck, an associate professor at George Mason University's School of Policy, Government and International Affairs, told the Washington Examiner. Dueck was one of 121 conservative national security experts who signed an open letter in March promising to work \"energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office.\"\" Washington Post: 'I feel like I got smacked by a 2x4': Va. Republicans react to Trump as the likely nominee : With the departure of Ted Cruz from the presidential race Tuesday night, many national Republican loyalists lamented the future of a party that could field a nominee as polarizing as Donald Trump.

She now supports Libertarian presidential candidate Austin Peters and will not vote Republican in the November general election.\" NBC New York: Donald Trump Faces GOP Backlash in NJ as He Becomes Likely Presidential Nominee : \"Steve Lonegan, who once ran against Chris Christie for governor, was state chair for Cruz. Now he's packing up what's left of the campaign, buttons, stickers and all. \"I'm not going to say I'm voting for Hillary. I'm also not voting for Donald Trump,\" he said. \"I may not vote.\"\" Wisconsin Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke : Steineke \"who has called Trump \"a liberal and a liar,\" hedged in his opposition, but said Wednesday he does not currently support the presumptive nominee.\" Burglinton, Iowa Tea Party Chairwoman Rose Kendall : \"At this point, Kendall said she was unlikely to vote in November for any candidate.\" Meanwhile, other prominent conservatives are working to distance themselves from Trump or not commenting on whether they will support him in November: Washington Post: Mitt Romney will skip Trump's nominating convention in Cleveland : Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, plans to skip this summer's Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Donald Trump will be officially nominated -- an unusual move that underscores the deep unease many Republican leaders have about the brash celebrity mogul as their standard bearer. Former Senator Bob Dole : \"Despite the fact that Bob Dole is attending the RNC this year, he will not commit to voting for the Republican nominee in November.\" Michigan Governor Rick Snyder : \"Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican in his second and final term as governor, maintained a distance from the political race. His spokesman, Ari Adler, said Wednesday that Snyder was \"not planning on getting involved in the presidential election right now, as he has too many immediate challenges to address,\" including the Flint water crisis and funding for Detroit schools.\" Albuquerque Journal: Martinez not ready to endorse Trump : Republican Gov.

{"text":"By Martine Powers | 05\/10\/2016 10:00 AM EDT With help from Heather Caygle and Darius Dixon UBER, LYFT OPT FOR BIG STATEMENT IN AUSTIN: Uber and Lyft are shutting down ride-hailing operations in Austin, Texas, after the city's residents voted in favor of driver-fingerprinting requirements and restrictions on picking up passengers in traffic lanes - a drastic move that could have widespread implications for the rideshare industry in other American cities. Together, the companies spent millions of a dollars on a wall-to-wall marketing campaign aimed at persuading voters to reject the regulations - and now, they're quitting the city out of protest. Here's the real question: Will this method of political brinkmanship spread to other cities, with rideshare giants Uber and Lyft threatening to snatch away their services if they don't get their way on election day? As The Wall Street Journal notes, \"Uber has used this tactic to pressure local regulators in Portland, Ore., Las Vegas and Miami, and it has since resumed operations in those cities.\" The Austin American-Statesman weighed in on the brouhaha, applauding voters who pushed back against Big Rideshare, but also called for local politicians to find grounds for negotiation. \"All too often, Lyft and Uber have demonstrated a bullying attitude, openly flouting city laws to enter the Austin market, then demanding that the city bend to their business models - or else. That might fly in some other cities. But it doesn't work in Austin, where even residents inclined to support Lyft and Uber were put off by such tactics,\" the paper wrote in an editorial Monday night. \"While some might be gloating over Prop 1's failure now, Austin residents are not likely to look favorably in the future on elected officials who ... opted for complacency. That should be incentive enough for the City Council to issue an invitation to Lyft and Uber to return to negotiations - but on equal terms this time around.\" IT'S TUESDAY: Good morning and thanks for tuning into POLITICO's Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports. John Kloosterman from United Airlines had pointed out a while back that Radiohead's extensive discography is chock-a-block full of transportation-related lyrics. Well, after listening to the entirety of their new album, MT is sorry to report that there's only one song with a transportation reference. Shout-out in tomorrow's MT to anyone who writes in with the name of the song. (In the meantime, enjoy this nugget from their 1995 album, \"The Bends.\") Submit your guesses: mpowers@politico.com or @martinepowers. \"I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you.\" (h\/t John Kloosterman of United Airlines) THE BUDGET SAGA CONTINUES: For the third time, Senate Democrats on Monday night blocked the energy and water spending bill over a controversial amendment on Iran's heavy water pushed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then filed cloture on the amendment, setting up a procedural vote no later than Wednesday that will require 60 senators to agree to advance the amendment. Pro Energy's Darius Dixon explains the strategy behind the move: \"If, as expected, Cotton falls short, he plans to withdraw the amendment, and the Senate will likely proceed to votes on the underlying spending bill, Sen. Lamar Alexander, the energy and water appropriations subcommittee chair, said on the floor [Monday] evening.\" Why do we care? Senate appropriators are anxious to get to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development budget bill, but the appropriations package is in a holding pattern until the energy and water bill either gets passed by the full Senate or is placed on the shelf. IN CASE YOU FORGOT: Heritage Action for America is still fighting in opposition to Rep. Bill Shuster's FAA bill, calling on members of the House to abandon the bill in a letter sent Monday. They argue that the labor provisions in the proposal amount to a \"dangerous union giveaway,\" and that a privatized air traffic control system would result in \"runaway costs and less stable American skyways.\" The letter ticks off a list of potential labor issues associated with the plan that the conservative groups say will give unions the upper hand, essentially erasing all the cost-saving and efficiency benefits touted by Shuster backers. \"Simply put, the protections employed by former President [Ronald] Reagan during the illegal air traffic controller strike in 1981 will no longer be available,\" Heritage Action wrote. So nice you say it twice: It's not the first time Heritage Action has spoken out against the bill: The conservative organization sent out a missive lambasting the bill back in February. At the time, Heritage warned that a reorganized air traffic control system could \"keep taxpayers on the hook for serious missteps.\" ** A message from the Air Line Pilots Association, International: By proposing to grant Norwegian Air International (NAI) a foreign carrier permit, the Obama Administration is failing to enforce our Open Skies agreement with the European Union, thereby harming tens of thousands of U.S. workers. The Department of Transportation should stand up for U.S. workers and immediately deny NAI's request. ** BRACING FOR IMPACT: Takata's latest full-year financial forecast estimates that it lost $121 million last year because of the cost related to recall efforts and lawsuits from the families of airbag inflator victims - and that doesn't even take into account the most recent announcement from NHTSA that doubled the amount of cars in the U.S. under recall, Bloomberg reports. The company had posted about $270 million in profit the year before. \"Takata's recall crisis is like the Titanic hitting the iceberg,\" analyst Takeshi Miyao told Bloomberg. \"You don't realize the enormity until you see the impact from it.\" MAKING A CASE FOR GATEWAY: Common Good predicts that building the Gateway Rail Tunnel Project between New York and New Jersey would save taxpayers billions of dollars in the long run. In a new report, the advocacy organization outlines the costs of waiting to execute the project, which was just ballyhooed by Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx last week. \"When compared to an 18-month process to finish review and permitting, a three-year permitting timetable would increase taxpayer cost of the project by over $3 billion, and a further two-year delay would increase costs by almost $10 billion. Another two years would raise costs by more than $13 billion,\" Common Good writes. \"The calculations include the construction cost increase from delay, delayed construction benefits, lost business activity, lost property tax revenue, delay in environmental benefits, and additional costs from shutting down one or both existing tunnels.\" ASCE TALKS DOWNSTREAM COSTS: The American Society of Civil Engineers is expected to release a report later today with new data and analysis on America's infrastructure funding shortfall. The study is an update on a report released several years ago that concluded that families lose $3,100 per year in personal household income because of the government's failure to adequately invest in infrastructure. Here's our guess: That number will have grown even larger since the original report. TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT: The FAA is bringing on three new companies to help improve the detection and identification of drones flying too close to airports. In an announcement on Monday, FAA officials said that they decided to expand the agency's Pathfinder Initiative, and partner with three businesses - Gryphon Sensors, Liteye Systems Inc. and Sensofusion - to come up with new methods to keep track of drones flying in restricted airspace. What he wants to hear: Sen. Bill Nelson - who frequently raises the alarm about drones spotted in close proximity to airports - praised the announcement, but called for more programs aimed at reducing the potential threats of drone technology. \"While this is a welcome step, we need to do more than just detect rogue drones; we need to disable them if they pose a threat to the flying public,\" Nelson said.

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, and is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar with the matter. The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets. An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but said he couldn't supply any further details. Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favorite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, its finances remain sound. Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier this month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal. Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. Enron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a Sept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63. Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was \"getting a bit more resistance\" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding, he said. The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility. Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lower rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses. Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor confidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last week could impair \"Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business.\" The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are doing business with Enron on \"essentially the same terms\" as they have in the past. \"There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,\" he said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's finances. The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said. Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. \"Confidence in this company was lost,\" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line. \"But confidence will be restored.\" Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have access to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines. Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illustrates the pressure Enron is feeling. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas By Paul Kedrosky 10\/29\/2001 The Wall Street Journal A22 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy markets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those are the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern. A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled. Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No longer. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenues, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and selling stakes in energy producers. The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at around 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy. But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a \"new economy\" Web-based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. According to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be valued accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the company's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its price then. Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under strange circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in California's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial statements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's troubles were hiding in plain sight. It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad. Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter. Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the company filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a \"senior officer of Enron is the managing member\" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron \"manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars.\" It was, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund. There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he severed his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this year -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had been done. As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enron relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-footed hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission were left with many questions, and very few answers. To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a year ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow\/LJM and the company. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003. We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be seen, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency. Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and retired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves. --- Mr. Kedrosky is a professor of business at the University of British Colombia.

OPPEL Jr. 10\/29\/2001 The New York Times Page 9, Column 4 c. 2001 New York Times Company DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billion in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today. Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off commercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it. Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said. Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting. Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. Lately, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and two major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001 By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mutual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the havoc may continue. More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embattled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to fund tracker Morningstar. Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's halving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders. Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m shares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn. The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or 5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several leading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January. Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are \"dated\", implying that the funds' positions in the company have changed. Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said managers of the group's larger funds had been \"lightening up\" their Enron holdings this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagship Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say when. Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also declined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding shares as of March 31. But Aim said the position had since been \"trimmed substantially\". Other top fund owners, as of the most recent filings, included the Alliance Premier Growth fund, the Janus Twenty, Janus Mercury and Janus Growth & Income funds, Fidelity Magellan, AXP New Dimensions Fund, Putnam Investors, Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities funds and Morgan Stanley Dividend Growth fund. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers. By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY. 10\/29\/2001 Financial Times (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, the US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-wheeling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty. Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind. Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these \"related-party transactions\". The departure of Andy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed. With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity. \"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side,\" observes Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank. On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle \"new economy\" magic on to old economy companies. Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to develop energy trading. For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy under-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it. The two sides of the business - trading and generation\/supply - have always been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets. The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president, director, manager and associate\/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. Employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they delivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: \"It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules.\" The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a \"loose-tight\" management model expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and McKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets. Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative force behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years. Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation\/remuneration. Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way: \"As long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you want around here.\" This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. The success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world's leading e-commerce company. It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint venture with International Business Machines and America Online, the internet service provider. In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most powerful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of America and Boeing. In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation. A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix. \"They went after too many things too quickly,\" says Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency. A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparency. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed. David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many investors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management: \"The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable.\" The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. \"The problems, in our view, stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills,\" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. \"Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant energy business.\" Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enron Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This helped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise. \"They over-promised on the new business they created,\" says Chris Bartlett, a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the company. \"Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the broadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price.\" Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-the-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith Barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the past three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets. And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team will have to tighten up. (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

By SHEILA MCNULTY and GARY SILVERMAN. 10\/29\/2001 Financial Times (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price. The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among US investors. Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its financial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to \"establish additional lines of liquidity\". \"Once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,\" Mr Palmer said. The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October 16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders' equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, who was forced to take a leave of absence last week. Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically \"junk\" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade. \"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations,\" said Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney. \"These activities require at least an investment grade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements.\" The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says 2001-10-29 04:30 (New York) Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified officials close to negotiations. The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed within days. Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said. The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement. The company's shares were further dented after an investor sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company $35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest. USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral. By Janet McGurty 10\/29\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of investors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings. Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial transactions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week. But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases. While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other power producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry. \"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth,\" Patterson said. As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. And plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off. Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. \"It's a different place,\" AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powerful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Baltimore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which planned to make an equity investment in the company. \"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. economy, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver,\" said Christian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman. RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth, according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise. \"Calpine does it already,\" he said, referring to the California-based independent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates contracted out. \"What drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level,\" he added. Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark spreads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies. SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning back to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line. \"Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward revision of earnings guidance.\" said Patterson. Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America. CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distribution units as well as other international investments. Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings. The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time. \"The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders,\" Allegheny said.

Enron seeks new credit line; reportedly for 1-2 bln usd 10\/29\/2001 AFX (AP) Copyright 2001 AFX News; Source: World Reporter (TM) NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line, a spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. The company is in talks to raise between 1-2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days, it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying. The deal, which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence, would supplement existing lines. These are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears. Enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. jms For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies with the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, with an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding \"in addition to derivatives and other structured product exposures,\" according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum. Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loan facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 million loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also participated, Securities Data said. On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that \"in order to dispel uncertainty in the financial community,\" it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line. \"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity -- that's nothing out of the ordinary,\" said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the departure of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and services, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines. \"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested along with Enron in some of its partnerships,\" said Ms. Applebaum. A spokesman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did not know the amount of its exposure. Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 million of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $100 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also have some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said. Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: Enron in talks for $1-2 bln credit line - WSJ. 10\/29\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion and could close a deal within days, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. According to officials close to the situation, the new credit would supplement existing credit lines, largely tapped out after the company drew down about $3 billion last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery investors' fears, the Journal reported. The paper said that an Enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but could not supply any further details. Confidence in Enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships. Its stock has tumbled amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's ousted Chief Financial Officer's links to some of the partnerships. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant. 10\/29\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd , said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy giant Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant. Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate of Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning thermal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant. \"We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power market,\" a Teijin spokesman said. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers. In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus. The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's existing power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron. Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan. The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by June 2002. Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says 2001-10-28 23:39 (New York) Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd. will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire service, without citing sources. Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic- fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16 million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of Tokyo, the report said. Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell electricity directly to large commercial users without going through exiting utilities, the report said. Money and Business\/Financial Desk; Section 3 Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 10\/28\/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company IS time running out for Enron? At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring. And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets. ''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way.'' But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting. Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value. Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company. The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling could not be reached. Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas. THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch. The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash. Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide. The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year. Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations. ''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger said. ''It's got everyone scared.'' In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company. A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits. Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades. ''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo. For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do business with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. ''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down,'' he said. Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business. But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements. Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances. The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference. DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report. The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose. In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors. Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company. In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.'' Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year. In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming. David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note after the call. To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume. ''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay said in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.'' But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years. Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. ''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.'' ''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said. Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say. ''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable.'' James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits. Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy. ''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist. IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices. Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States. Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power. Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business. The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, it had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products.'' For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement. Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that. ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not. Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound. But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.

Money and Business\/Financial Desk; Section 3 Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron By FLOYD NORRIS 10\/28\/2001 The New York Times Page 13, Column 6 c. 2001 New York Times Company AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers. Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals? A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies. Q. How did those investments do? A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that. Q. Why can't that be discerned? A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely. Q. Why were they so complicated? A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule. Q. Who made money from these transactions? A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors. Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now? A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important. Q. When were concerns raised with Enron? A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships. Q. How did Enron do? A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Q. How did that happen? A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings. Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules? A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Money and Business\/Financial Desk; Section 3 DataBank Investors Seem to Ignore Discouraging News By MICHAEL BRICK 10\/28\/2001 The New York Times Page 17, Column 3 c. 2001 New York Times Company Investors sent stocks markedly higher last week, despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor. The Dow Jones industrial average, strengthened by triple-digit rallies on Monday and Thursday, ended the week nearly back to its level of Sept. 10, one day before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on Sept. 10. Investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected. They also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago, at some companies by more than 30 percent. All the bad news, investors seemed to surmise, meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy, with tax breaks, spending and lower interest rates. The Dow average gained 341.06, or 3.7 percent, to close at 9,545.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 97.65 points, or 5.8 percent, to 1,768.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 31.13, or 2.9 percent, to 1,104.61.

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports 2001-10-28 20:20 (New York) Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources. Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17 when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The company has been shut out of the leading market for low- interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the FT said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper said. Enron Asks Banks For Additional Credit -FT 10\/28\/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is attempting to persuade banks to provide additional credit, The Financial Times reported on its Web site Sunday. The company was also due to hold a special board meeting Sunday to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among U.S. investors, The Financial Times reported. The Financial Times quoted Enron spokesman Mark Palmer as saying he hoped the company could have something to announce in coming days as a result of its latest effort to \"establish additional lines of liquidity.\" \"Once we are able to the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,\" The Financial Times quoted Palmer as saying.

Lockheed Martin Corp. won the coveted right to build the nation's next-generation fighter aircraft, beating out Boeing Co. for what could be the biggest military contract ever. Culminating a five-year battle between two of the world's largest defense contractors, Pentagon officials picked Lockheed Martin to begin development of the Joint Strike Fighter, with plans to purchase 3,000 of the planes at a cost of more than $200 billion. With the potential for foreign sales topping another $200 billion, the contract is considered the most lucrative in U.S. history. \"This really is the contract of the millennium,\" said Christopher Hellman, analyst with the Center for Defense Information. \"Nothing has or will come close. \" Peter Pae Ford Settles Lawsuit Over Faulty Part In the largest automotive class-action settlement in history, Ford Motor Co. will reimburse customers who paid hundreds of millions of dollars to replace a faulty part that caused their vehicles to stall. It was uncertain how many consumers would qualify for reimbursements in the range of $160 apiece. The settlement caps six years of litigation. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the cost to Ford would be as high as $2.7 billion. Myron Levin AMR Posts Record Loss in Quarter Even though more Americans are flying again, the airline industry continues to reel and its problems are expected to worsen this holiday season. AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, the world's largest airline, posted a record loss for the third quarter, even after getting $508 million in federal financial aid. Although the number of passengers has kept growing each week since the Sept. 11 attacks, about 20% fewer people are flying. Less than a month before the busy Thanksgiving weekend, American Airlines says advance bookings for November are down 6% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the airlines are now reporting a little-noticed aspect of the government rescue package: They have to pay federal taxes on the cash grants. James F. Peltz ITC Says Imports Hurt Steel Industry The International Trade Commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry, paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with Europe and Asia. The independent U.S. agency has until mid-December to provide the White House with a list of proposed remedies, which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel. Beleaguered U.S. steelmakers applauded the decision. President Bush, who instigated the ITC investigation, is expected to approve the protective measures, though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks. Evelyn Iritani Shares of Enron Plummet Amid Losses Enron Corp.'s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some Enron assets. The stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by Wall Street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles. Two conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves, and several analysts lowered their recommendations on Enron. Enron has reiterated that its finances are strong. And although analysts note that Enron's core businesses remain sound, some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems. To mollify investors, Enron replaced its chief financial officer, who until recently headed the two partnerships the SEC is eyeing. Nancy Rivera Brooks Pentagon OKs Northrop Bid for Newport News Northrop Grumman Corp. was all but assured of winning the bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. as the Pentagon endorsed the deal and the Justice Department, citing antitrust concerns, blocked a rival bid by General Dynamics Corp. It marked a stunning turn of events for Northrop, which got the nod to acquire the Virginia builder of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers despite having been the underdog. The Los Angeles-based defense contractor made an unsolicited offer for Newport News after the shipbuilder had inked a $2.1-billion deal with General Dynamics. Separately, Northrop said third-quarter earnings fell 22% because of a large drop in pension fund investments. Peter Pae Hollywood Production Jobs Fall to 4-Year Low Skittishness following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has exacerbated an already slow season in Hollywood, pushing employment in the movie, television and film industry to a four-year low in September, state statistics show. Cutbacks and delayed projects by the major studios has trickled down through the industry, leading to a spate of layoffs at small companies that provide equipment and services for the industry. Meg James Grammy Officials Urge Greene Settlement High-ranking officials at the Grammy organization recommended a settlement of more than half a million dollars to resolve sexual assault and battery allegations against the nonprofit group's chief executive, C. Michael Greene, Grammy sources said. The proposed settlement, subject to approval by the group's board of directors, has ignited an internal revolt, with at least a dozen of the 41 trustees privately calling for Greene's firing, the sources said. Greene declined to comment. Attorneys for the Grammy nonprofit group previously denied that Greene assaulted or had any sexual contact with Jill Geimer, the Grammy executive who has threatened to sue over Greene's alleged misconduct. Chuck Philips EMI Ousts Record Label Executive Nancy Berry British music conglomerate EMI Group sacked Nancy Berry, the vice chairwoman of its worldwide Virgin Records division. Berry's exit came a week after the London-based record company ousted its global record chief, Ken Berry, who is Nancy Berry's former husband. The shake-up follows a dispiriting period for EMI, including a disastrous sales debut from pop icon Mariah Carey, who suffered a nervous breakdown months after signing an $80-million contract with the company this year. Nancy Berry spearheaded the elaborate marketing campaign for Carey's album, \"Glitter,\" which has sold fewer than 400,000 copies since its Sept. 11 debut. Jeff Leeds Management Buyout of G&L Realty Approved Stockholders of G&L Realty Corp. approved a management-led buyout of the real estate investment trust despite a higher offer by a rival group and concerns that the deal unfairly favors top executives. The company's co-chairmen, Daniel Gottlieb and Steven Lebowitz, plan to take the small Beverly Hills-based company private after a majority of shareholders backed their $12-a-share offer. The management-led offer triggered a shareholder lawsuit this year that claimed G&L's board breached its fiduciary duty Jesus Sanchez Internet Archive Turns Back Web Pages of Time The nonprofit Internet Archive launched its so-called Wayback Machine, allowing Web surfers to check out most Internet sites that have vanished and older versions of sites that are still around. The San Francisco effort is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle, a millionaire technologist who wants to preserve the Internet's ephemera for generations to come. Like many Internet pioneers, however, Kahle faces unfamiliar risks along with the opportunities: the archive might be the most massive violation of copyright law since ownership rights over words came into being.

In a bid the company says will increase operating income by $1 billion during the next three years, Sears will look more like a mass merchant, with more self-serve areas and centralized checkouts. As part of its financial realignment, Sears will cut 4,900 jobs in the next 18 months. The company's challenge, analysts say, is to offer something unique within its niche of serving middle-income consumers--an ever difficult proposition against innovative rivals such as Kohl's and Target.

BUSINESS Ralph Bivins Devon Energy makes building its own with major lease RALPH BIVIN Staff 10\/28\/2001 Houston Chronicle 2 STAR 10 (Copyright 2001) HOUSTON is known as the \"Energy Capital of the World.\" And a glance around the downtown skyline proves the nickname is appropriate. Houston skyscrapers bearing the names of Enron, Chevron, Exxon and Shell make significant contributions to the view. Now another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy capital image even further. The 36-story Two Allen Center has been renamed Devon Energy Tower. Devon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon gets to put its name on the structure. The lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space in the 1 million-square-foot building, at 1212 Smith St. Devon recently announced its plans to acquire Mitchell Energy & Development, but it will maintain Mitchell's offices in The Woodlands, said Klay Kimker, manager of office administration for Devon. Kevin Snodgrass and Tim Relyea of Cushman & Wakefield represented Devon in the transaction. Paul Frazier and Margaret Sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of TrizecHahn Office Properties, the owner of the building. TrizecHahn owns both the Allen Center and Cullen Center office complexes, a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown. The TrizecHahn office space is nearly full right now, but Enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby Enron building is complete. Teamsters to build facilities Teamsters Union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the Katy Freeway. To replace the Katy Freeway building, the union expects to build two smaller structures near Bush Intercontinental Airport to house different chapters, said A.W. Parker, secretary treasurer of Local 968. Parker's group is expecting to build a 13,000-square-foot building at Ella Boulevard at Beltway 8. Another Teamsters group has purchased 4.5 acres on Beltway 8 at Diplomatic Plaza Drive, in the World Houston Business Center. The land was purchased from the Licha Family Trust. Tony Patronella and Marc Drumwright, both of Southwest Realty Advisors, handled the sale. Chicago firm buying property A Chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in Houston. ML Capital Ventures has purchased two small office structures: the 71,736-square-foot building at 5500 Northwest Central Drive and the 66,338-square-foot building at 5301 Hollister. The building on Northwest Central Drive is the headquarters of BJ Services energy company. Mike Luecht, president of ML Capital, said his firm will acquire two additional Houston office buildings before the end of the year. ML Capital, which has been in business for eight months, will exceed Luecht's initial plan to buy more than $22 million worth of suburban office space in Houston in the company's start-up phase. Luecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate: buying warehouses in Chicago and buying office buildings in suburban Houston. Houston's economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors, Luecht said. Many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of Houston realty market in the 1980s, Luecht said. In its most recent deal, ML Ventures bought the 5500 Northwest Central building in partnership with Avgeris & Associates of Chicago. Tom Bousquet of CB Richard Ellis brokered the deal. Woodlands opens new section Several $1 million home sites go up for sale this weekend as The Woodlands opens a new section of its Carlton Woods gated community. The premium lots will be facing the new Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course. Custom lots will range in price from $150,000 to $1 million and range in size from one-fifth of an acre to two-and-three-fourths acres. The Carlton Woods community is the first gated community in The Woodlands and has been well received by upper-end home buyers, said Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands. Thirty-two homes are under construction in Carlton Woods and all of them are priced at more than $1 million. A total of 208 lots have been sold in Carlton Woods, which opened about a year ago.

Business\/Financial Desk; Section C Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt By FLOYD NORRIS 10\/27\/2001 The New York Times Page 2, Column 5 c. 2001 New York Times Company The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash. The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning levels. By ROBERT CLOW, SHEILA MCNULTY and JENNY WIGGINS. 10\/27\/2001 Financial Times (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy price for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plummeted. Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-balance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched an informal investigation into the company's finances. Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch. Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis. \"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business,\" said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. \"In a situation like this, cash is king.\" Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business. If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that. So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up well. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal. Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its most recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer. Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity investments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a certain level. Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which should have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed. The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market.

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously.

Business; Financial Desk Enron Decline Continues Bloomberg News 10\/27\/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-2 Copyright 2001 \/ The Times Mirror Company HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. \"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,\" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. \"People are questioning the credibility of management.\" The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11\/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. Enron's decision to tap its credit line was \"a smart financial move,\" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. \"It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.\" Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BUSINESS Enron taps credit line; stock slides \/ Company says cash will boost confidence TOM FOWLER Staff 10\/27\/2001 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2001) Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short- term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. \"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,\" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as \"good management decisions.\" Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. \"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,\" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. \"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,\" Feygin said. Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. \"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,\" she said. \"Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.\" Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. \"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,\" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. \"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off.\" Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron says Microsoft breached contract Staff 10\/27\/2001 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 2 (Copyright 2001) Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in Houston this week, claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high-speed Internet service. The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would provide Internet bandwidth to Microsoft as it rolled out its MSN Broadband service. Enron's broadband network would link MSN customers in over two dozen states, including Texas. Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other states for MSN. On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if it didn't provide an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg News. In the lawsuit, Enron claims Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project's first phase. The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but the 14 states served by Qwest. Enron officials declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was \"confident that we have upheld our agreement with Enron.\" Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Editorial Desk; Section A Journal How to Lose a War By Frank Rich 10\/27\/2001 The New York Times Page 19, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company Welcome back to Sept. 10. The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New Jersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school children again. Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everything changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20. This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prudence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine. Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, ServiceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees. To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge. Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have brought us where we are today. The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern. Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credibility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republican Bill Frist. It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag. As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international and domestic terrorism.'' Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't respond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents). If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion. The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment. Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''instead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.'' Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Shoulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff. Drawing Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. City - Enron directors cash in shares. By Simon English. 10\/27\/2001 The Daily Telegraph P31 (c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001 LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July. Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to \"dispel uncertainty in the financial community\" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: \"We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community.\" The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called \"failed investments\". Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3. 10\/27\/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday. They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buying the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. firms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial project, the source told Reuters. The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank and Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added. At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel. All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast. The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the second phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility MSEB. MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can no longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract. Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That six month period expires on November 19. Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian government. TIME RUNNING OUT The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after November 19. \"It is one of the items on the agenda,\" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying. The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. \"The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands down,\" the paper added. A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far. The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interest. They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount. Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 percent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel. Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $1 billion, the paper added. Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment.

Business Enron sues Microsoft for breach of contract ; Move could block high-speed service The Associated Press,Bloomberg News 10\/27\/2001 The Seattle Times Fourth E4 (Copyright 2001) HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for broadband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest software company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions. Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- where Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN. Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to offer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential customers in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner. \"We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers,\" Visse said. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing company policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest energy trader. Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported. Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported. Alternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told them to get Microsoft's products instead. The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community that Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all. Browser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lift of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Reichard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site. Mike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing Microsoft of anti-competitive practices. -- The Associated Press MicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store SAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microsoft next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony's PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game market, a Sony spokeswoman said. The two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony's San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a Digital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokeswoman Kirsten Maynard said. In April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the software. In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an advanced-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15. \"A lot has changed with both companies,\" Maynard said. \"It sort of became not-a-fit anymore.\" Sony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Nintendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment on the shutdown. -- Bloomberg News Copyright [copyright] Seattle Times Company, All Rights Reserved.

{"text":"prepared remarks here this is confusing There are a total of 4,766 Democratic delegates - 4,047 pledged, 719 super delegates. A candidate needs 2,384 votes to win. Let's be clear. It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention Fdelegates by June 14 - the end of the primary season - with pledged delegates alone. She will need super delegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, it will be a contested convention. In terms of super delegates, I want to say the following. Obviously, we are taking on virtually the entire Democratic establishment. Secretary Clinton has an estimated 520 super delegates. Many of those committed to her even before we got into this campaign. We have all of 39 super delegates. In other words, while we have won 45 percent of the pledged delegates up to this point, we have only 7 percent of the super delegates -- We announced the beginning of this campaign a year ago. Before I talk about delegate math and a path toward victory, I want to say a few words about how far we've come in the last year. When we started this campaign we were considered a \"fringe\" candidacy. We had no campaign organization, no money and very little name recognition. In national polls, we were 60 points or more behind Secretary Clinton, we were taking on the entire Democratic establishment and, in the Clinton campaign, the most powerful political organization in the country. That was then. Today is today. As of today, we have won 17 states and hope to make Indiana the 18th, and we have received some 9 million votes. In recent national polls we are either defeating Secretary Clinton or are within single digits behind her. In terms of fundraising, we have received more individual campaign contributions, 7.4 million, than any candidate in presidential history at his point. What the political revolution is about is that we have shown we can run a strong, winning campaign without a super PAC and without being dependent on big-money interests. As of today, our rallies have brought out more than 1.1 million people throughout this country and that number will go up significantly by the time we are through in California. Very importantly, in state after state we have won a strong majority of the votes of younger people - voters under 45 years of age. Our ideas are the future of the Democratic Party and the future of America. Let me now say a few words about delegate math and a path toward victory. There are a total of 4,766 Democratic delegates - 4,047 pledged, 719 super delegates. A candidate needs 2,384 votes to win. Let's be clear. It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention Fdelegates by June 14 - the end of the primary season - with pledged delegates alone. She will need super delegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, it will be a contested convention. Currently, Secretary Clinton has 1,645 pledged delegates - 55 percent of the total. We have 1318 pledged delegates - 45 percent of the total. There are 10 states plus D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam remaining. We believe we are quite strong in many of these remaining contests and have an excellent chance to win California - the state with far in a way the most delegates. For us to win the majority of pledged delegates, we need to win 710 out of the remaining 1083. That is 65 percent. That is, admittedly, a tough road to climb, but not an impossible one. And we intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining. In terms of super delegates, I want to say the following. Obviously, we are taking on virtually the entire Democratic establishment. Secretary Clinton has an estimated 520 super delegates. Many of those committed to her even before we got into this campaign. We have all of 39 super delegates. In other words, while we have won 45 percent of the pledged delegates up to this point, we have only 7 percent of the super delegates. Two points: First, those super delegates in states where either candidate has won a landslide victories ought to seriously reflect on whether they should cast their super delegate vote in line with the wishes of the people in their states. Let me give you just a few examples. In the state of Washington, we won that caucus with almost 73 percent of the vote but at this point Secretary Clinton has 10 super delegates. We have zero. In Minnesota, we won the caucus there with 61 percent of the vote. Hillary Clinton has 11 super delegates. We have three. In Colorado, we won that state with 59 percent of the vote. Secretary Clinton has 10 super delegates. We have zero. In New Hampshire, we won that state with more than 60 percent of the vote. Secretary Clinton has six super delegates. We have zero. And that pattern continues in other states where we have won landslide victories. Secondly, and extremely importantly, Secretary Clinton and I have many differences on some of the most important issues facing the American people. We disagree on trade, on breaking up Wall Street banks, on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, on imposing a carbon tax to combat climate change, on insisting that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes, on fracking and on a number of other issues. But where Secretary Clinton and I agree and where every delegate to the Democratic convention agrees is that it would be a disaster for Donald Trump or some other right-wing Republican to become president of the United States. Therefore, it is incumbent upon every super delegate to take a hard and objective look at which candidate stands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump. And in that regard, I think the evidence is extremely clear that I would be the stronger candidate to defeat Trump or any other Republican. This is not just the subjective opinion of Bernie Sanders. This is based on virtually every national and state poll done in the last several months. Look at some of the very recent national polls. In a Morning Consult survey, we beat Trump by 16. She beats him by seven. An Investor Business Daily poll, we beat Trump by 12. She beats him by seven. In the USA Today poll, we beat Trump by 15. She beats him by 11. A George Washington University poll, we beat him by 10. She beats him by three. Fox News, we beat Trump by 14. She beats him by seven And it's the same story in battleground state after battleground state. In Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina and many other states we defeat Trump by larger numbers than she does. Further, what recent elections tell us is that Democrats win elections when the voter turnout is high. Republicans win elections when voter turnout is low. There is little doubt in my mind that the energy and excitement we have created will, in fact, create a large voter turnout in November, which will mean not only victory for the White House but for Democratic candidates in the Senate, the House and in governor's races. This is an important reality that super delegates cannot ignore. From: Haxo, Chris Sent: Sunday, May 01, 2016 2:30 PM To: Research_D Subject: Video Request: Bernie Presser in DC coming up on shift.

{"text":"Here they are: Talking Points on Party Unity: Democrats Overwhelmingly United * Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited about both of our candidates. * By and large we've had a great primary, with substantive candidates whose vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the American people. * And we're going to come out of our convention more unified and stronger than ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party. * Just look at the new poll today from CBS\/New York Times: A new CBS\/NYT poll shows that Democrats are more united today than in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into the 2016 election. The poll showed that 72 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually elected to a landslide victory. Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to Republicans, who are split 55%-43% between \"mostly hopeful\" and \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican Party. This echoes what we've seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut : Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed. New York : Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side. It's clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.","label":0}

{"text":"For Immediate Release May 17, 2017 DNC Chair's Statement on Today's Primaries WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on today's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon: \"With two more Democratic primary contests closed tonight in Kentucky and Oregon, it's once again clear that our voters are excited and enthusiastic about the future of our party, about building on the last seven years of progress, and ready to hold Donald Trump accountable for the damage he's done as a candidate and the damage he's promising he would do as president. \"In just the last week, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed to slash taxes for those at the top like himself, faced questions about pretending to be his own publicist, refused to address his well-documented history of misogyny, called his campaign's selection of a white supremacist delegate a 'database error,' and insulted one of our country's most important allies. Every day it seems, the American people are discovering a new example of his recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament. That's why Democrats will head into the general election energized, understanding what's at stake and championing the values and priorities that match those of the American people. As we move closer to our convention and the general election, it's clearer than ever we must elect a Democrat as our 45th President.\" ###","label":0}

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics, I apologize in advance. I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village. The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit. I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that can help him facilitate the change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for the execution of this endeavour are in my possession. The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only).

This individual apparently runs a web site on which he had been touting the Soon\/Baliunas position. While it is sometimes a mistake to get into these exchanges (because one's interlocutor turns out to be ineducable and\/or just looking for a quote to reproduce out of context in an attempt to embarrass you), there was something about this guy's formulations that made me think, at each round, that it might be worth responding. In the end, a couple of colleagues with whom I have shared this exchange already have suggested that its content would be of interest to others, and so I am sending it to our \"environmental science and policy breakfast\" list for your entertainment and, possibly, future breakfast discussion. The items in the correspondence are arranged below in chronological order, so that it can be read straight through, top to bottom.

It s unfortunate that so much attention is paid to a flawed analysis, but that s what happens when something happens to support the political climate in Washington. Do you feel the same way about the work of Mann et. al.? If not why not? Best, Nick Nick Schulz Editor TCS 1-800-619-5258 From: John P. Holdren [[2]mailto:john_holdren@harvard.edu] Sent: Monday, October 13, 2003 11:06 AM To: Nick Schulz Subject: Harvard Crimson coverage of Soon \/ Baliunas controversy Dear Nick Schultz -- I am sorry for the long delay in this response to your note of September 12. I have been swamped with other commitments. As you no doubt have anticipated, I do not put Mann et al. in the same category with Soon and Baliunas. If you seriously want to know \"Why not?\", here are three ways one might arrive at what I regard as the right conclusion: (1) For those with the background and patience to penetrate the scientific arguments, the conclusion that Mann et al. are right and Soon and Baliunas are wrong follows from reading carefully the relevant Soon \/ Baliunas paper and the Mann et al. response to it: W. Soon and S. Baliunas, \"Proxy climatic and environmental changes of the past 1000 years\", Climate Research, vol. 23, pp 89ff, 2003. M. Mann, C. Amman, R. Bradley, K. Briffa, P. Jones, T. Osborn, T. Crowley, M. Hughes, M. Oppenheimer, J. Overpeck, S. Rutherford, K. Trenberth, and T. Wigley, \"On past temperatures and anomalous late-20th century warmth\", EOS, vol 84, no. 27, pp 256ff, 8 July 2003. This is the approach I took. Soon and Baliunas are demolished in this comparison. (2) Those lacking the background and\/or patience to penetrate the two papers, and seriously wanting to know who is more likely to be right, have the option of asking somebody who does possess these characteristics -- preferably somebody outside the handful of ideologically committed and\/or oil-industry-linked professional climate-change skeptics -- to evaluate the controversy for them. Better yet, one could poll a number of such people. They can easily be found by checking the web pages of earth sciences, atmospheric sciences, and environmental sciences departments at any number of major universities. (3) The least satisfactory approach, for those not qualified for (1) and lacking the time or initiative for (2), would be to learn what one can about the qualifications (including publications records) and reputations, in the field in question, of the authors on the two sides. Doing this would reveal that Soon and Baliunas are, essentially, amateurs in the interpretation of historical and paleoclimatological records of climate change, while the Mann et al. authors include several of the most published and most distinguished people in the world in this field. Such an investigation would also reveal that Dr. Baliunas' reputation in this field suffered considerable damage a few years back, when she put her name on an incompetent critique of mainstream climate science that was never published anywhere respectable but was circulated by the tens of thousands, in a format mimicking that of a reprint from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in pursuit of signatures on a petition claiming that the mainstream findings were wrong. Of course, the third approach is the least satisfactory because it can be dangerous to assume that the more distinguished people are always right. Occasionally, it turns out that the opposite is true. That is one of several good reasons that it pays to try to penetrate the arguments, if one can, or to poll others who have tried to do so. But in cases where one is not able or willing to do either of these things -- and where one is able to discover that the imbalance of experience and reputation on the two sides of the issue is as lopsided as here -- one ought at least to recognize that the odds strongly favor the proposition that the more experienced and reputable people are right. If one were a policy maker, to bet the public welfare on the long odds of the opposite being true would be foolhardy. Sincerely, John Holdren PS: I have provided this response to your query as a personal communication, not as fodder for selective excerpting on your web site or elsewhere. If you do decide that you would like to propagate my views on this matter more widely, I ask that you convey my response in its entirety. At 11:16 AM 10\/13\/2003 -0400, you wrote: I have the patience but, by your definition certainly, not the background, so I suppose it s not surprising I came to a different conclusion. I guess my problem concerns what lawyers call the burden of proof. The burden weighs heavily much more heavily, given the claims on Mann et.al. than it does on Soon\/Baliunas. Would you agree? Falsifiability for the claims of Mann et. al. requires but a few examples, does it not? Soon\/Baliunas make claims that have no such burden. Isn t that correct? Best, Nick From: John P. Holdren [[3]mailto:john_holdren@harvard.edu] Sent: Tuesday, October 14, 2003 5:54 PM To: Nick Schulz Subject: RE: Harvard Crimson coverage of Soon \/ Baliunas controversy Nick-- Yes, I can see how it might seem that, in principle, those who are arguing for a strong and sweeping proposition (such as that \"the current period is the warmest in the last 1000 years\") must meet a heavy burden of proof, and that, because even one convincing counter-example shoots the proposition down, the burden that must be borne by the critics is somehow lighter. But, in practice, burden of proof is an evolving thing -- it evolves as the amount of evidence relevant to a particular proposition grows. To choose an extreme example, consider the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Both of these are \"empirical\" laws. Our confidence in them is based entirely on observation; neither one can be \"proven\" from more fundamental laws. Both are very sweeping. The first law says that energy is conserved in all physical processes. The second law says that entropy increases in all physical processes. So, is the burden of proof heavier on somebody who asserts that these laws are correct, or on somebody who claims to have found an exception to one or both of them? Clearly, in this case, the burden is heavier on somebody who asserts an exception. This is in part because the two laws have survived every such challenge in the past. No exception to either has ever been documented. Every alleged exception has turned out to be traceable to a mistake of some kind. This burden on those claiming to have found an exception is so strong that the US Patent Office takes the position, which has been upheld in court, that any patent application for an invention that violates either law can be rejected summarily, without any further analysis of the details. Of course, I am not asserting that the claim we are now in the warmest period in a millennium is in the same league with the laws of thermodynamics. I used the latter only to illustrate the key point that where the burden is heaviest depends on the state of prior evidence and analysis on the point in question -- not simply on whether a proposition is sweeping or narrow. In the case actually at hand, Mann et al. are careful in the nature of their claim. They write along the lines of \"A number of reconstructions of large-scale temperature changes support the conclusion\" that the current period is the warmest in the last millennium. And they write that the claims of Baliunas et al. are \"inconsistent with the preponderance of scientific evidence\". They are not saying that no shred of evidence to the contrary has ever been produced, but rather that analysis of the available evidence as a whole tends to support their conclusion. This is often the case in science. That is, there are often \"outlier\" data points or apparent contradictions that are not yet adequately explained, but still are not given much weight by most of the scientists working on a particular issue if a strong preponderance of evidence points the other way. This is because the scientists judge it to be more probable that the outlier data point or apparent contradiction will ultimately turn out to be explainable as a mistake, or otherwise explainable in a way that is consistent with the preponderance of evidence, than that it will turn out that the preponderance of evidence is wrong or is being misinterpreted. Indeed, apparent contradictions with a preponderance of evidence are FAR more often due to measurement error or analysis error than to real contradiction with what the preponderance indicates. A key point, then, is that somebody with a PhD claiming to have identified a counterexample does not establish that those offering a general proposition have failed in their burden of proof. The counterexample itself must pass muster as both valid in itself and sufficient, in the generality of its implications, to invalidate the proposition. In the case at hand, it is not even a matter of an \"outlier\" point or other seeming contradiction that has not yet been explained. Mann et al. have explained in detail why the supposed contrary evidence offered by Baliunas et al. does NOT constitute a counterexample. To those with some knowledge and experience in studies of this kind, the refutation by Mann et al is completely convincing. Sincerely, John Holdren At 08:08 AM 10\/15\/2003 -0400, you wrote: Dr. Holdren: Thank you for your thoughtful reply. I genuinely appreciate you taking the time. You are quite right about the laws of thermodynamics. And you are quite right that Mann et al is not in the same league as those laws and that s not to take anything from their basic research. You write to those with knowledge and experience in studies of this kind, the refutation by Mann et all is completely convincing. Since I do not have what you would consider the requisite knowledge or experience, I can t speak to that. I ve read the Mann papers and the Baliunas Soon paper and the Mann rebuttal and find Mann s claims based on his research extravagant and beyond what he can legitimately claim to know. That said, I m willing to believe it is because I don t have the tools necessary to understand. But if you will indulge a lay person with some knowledge of the matter, perhaps you could clear up a thing or two. Part of the confusion over Mann et al it seems to me has to do not with the research itself but with the extravagance of the claims they make based on their research. And yet you write: Mann et al. are careful in the nature of their claim. They write along the lines of A number of reconstructions of large-scale temperature changes support the conclusion that the current period is the warmest in the last millennium. And they write that the claims of Baliunas et al. are inconsistent with the preponderance of scientific evidence . That makes it seem as if Mann s not claiming anything particularly extraordinary based on his research. But Mann claimed in the NYTimes in 1998 that in their Nature study from that year Our conclusion was that the warming of the past few decades appears to be closely tied to emission of greenhouse gases by humans and not any of the natural factors.\" Does that seem to be careful in the nature of a claim? Respected scientists like Tom Quigley responded at the time by saying \"I think there's a limit to how far you can ever go.\" As for using proxy data to detect a man-made greenhouse effect, he said, \"I don't think we're ever going to get to the point where we're going to be totally convincing.\" These are two scientists who would agree on the preponderance of evidence and yet they make different claims about what that preponderance means. There are lots of respected climatologists who would say Mann has insufficient scientific basis to make that claim. Would you agree? The Soon Baliunas research is relevant to that element of the debate what the preponderance of evidence enables us to claim within reason. To that end, I don t think claims of Soon Baliunas are inconsistent with the preponderance of scientific evidence. I ll close by saying I m willing to admit that, as someone lacking a PhD, I could be punching above my weight. But I will ask you a different but related question How much hope is there for reaching reasonable public policy decisions that affect the lives of millions if the science upon which those decisions must be made is said to be by definition beyond the reach of those people? All best, Nick Date: Thu, 16 Oct 2003 08:46:23 -0400 To: \"Nick Schulz\" From: \"John P. Holdren\" Subject: RE: Harvard Crimson coverage of Soon \/ Baliunas controversy Nick-- You ask good questions. I believe the thoughtfulness of your questions and the progress I believe we are making in this interchange contain the seeds of the answer to your final question, which, if I may paraphrase just a bit, is whether there's any hope of reaching reasonable public-policy decisions when the details of the science germane to those decisions are impenetrable to most citizens. This is a hard problem. Certainly the difficulty is not restricted to climate science and policy, but applies also to nuclear-weapon science and policy, nuclear-energy science and policy, genetic science and policy, and much more. But I don't think the difficulties are insurmountable. That's why I'm in the business I'm in, which is teaching about and working on the intersection of science and technology with policy. Most citizens cannot penetrate the details of what is known about the how the climate works (and, of course, what is known even by the most knowledgeable climate scientists about this is not everything one would like to know, and is subject to modification by new data, new insights, new forms of analysis). Neither would most citizens be able to understand how a hydrogen bomb works (even if the details were not secret), or what factors will determine the leak rates of radioactive nuclides from radioactive-waste repositories, or what stem-cell research does and promises to be able to do. But, as Amory Lovins once said in addressing the question of whether the public deserved and could play a meaningful role in debates about nuclear-weapon policy, even though most citizens would never understand the details of how nuclear weapons work or are made, \"You don't have to be a chicken to know what to do with an egg.\" In other words, for many (but not all) policy purposes, the details that are impenetrable do not matter. There CAN be aspects of the details that do matter for public policy, of course. In those cases, it is the function and the responsibility of scientists who work across the science-and-policy boundary to communicate the policy implications of these details in ways that citizens and policy makers can understand. And I believe it is the function and responsibility of citizens and policy makers to develop, with the help of scientists and technologists, a sufficient appreciation of how to reach judgments about plausibility and credibility of communications about the science and technology relevant to policy choices so that the citizens and policy makers are NOT disenfranchised in policy decisions where science and technology are germane. How this is best to be done is a more complicated subject than I am prepared to try to explicate fully here. (Alas, I have already spent more time on this interchange than I could really afford from other current commitments.) Suffice it to say, for now, that improving the situation involves increasing at least somewhat, over time, the scientific literacy of our citizens, including especially in relation to how science works, how to distinguish an extravagant from a reasonable claim, how to think about probabilities of who is wrong and who is right in a given scientific dispute (including the question of burden of proof as you and I have been discussing it here), how consulting and polling experts can illuminate issues even for those who don't understand everything that the experts say, and why bodies like the National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deserve more credibility on the question of where mainstream scientific opinion lies than the National Petroleum Council, the Sierra Club, or the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. Regarding extravagant claims, you continue to argue that Mann et al. have been guilty of this, but the formulation of theirs that you offer as evidence is not evidence of this at all. You quote them from the NYT in 1998, referring to a study Mann and co-authors published in that year, as saying \"Our conclusion was that the warming of the past few decades appears to be closely tied to emission of greenhouse gases by humans and not any of the natural factors.\" and you ask \"Does that seem to be careful in the nature of a claim?\" My answer is: Yes, absolutely, their formulation is careful and appropriate. Please note that they did NOT say \"Global warming is closely tied to emission of greenhouse gases by humans and not any of the natural factors.\" They said that THEIR CONCLUSION (from a particular, specified study, published in NATURE) was that the warming of THE PAST FEW DECADES (that is, a particular, specified part of the historical record) APPEARS (from the evidence adduced in the specified study) to be closely tied... This is a carefully specified, multiply bounded statement, which accurately reflects what they looked at and what they found. And it is appropriately contingent --\"APPEARS to be closely tied\" -- allowing for the possibility that further analysis or new data could later lead to a different perspective on what appears to be true. With respect, it does not require a PhD in science to notice the appropriate boundedness and contingency in the Mann et al. formulation. It only requires an open mind, a careful reading, and a degree of understanding of the character of scientific claims and the wording appropriate to convey them that is accessible to any thoughtful citizen. That is why I'm an optimist. You go on to quote the respected scientist \"Tom Quigley\" as holding a contrary view to that expressed by Mann. But please note that: (1) I don't know of any Tom Quigley working in this field, so I suspect you mean to refer to the prominent climatologist Tom Wigley; (2) the statements you attribute to \"Quiqley\" do not directly contradict the careful statement of Mann (that is, it is entirely consistent for Mann to say that his study found that recent warming appears to be tied to human emissions and for Wigley to say that that there are limits to how far one can go with this sort of analysis, without either one being wrong); and (3) Tom Wigley is one of the CO-AUTHORS of the resounding Mann et al. refutation of Soon and Baliunas (see attached PDF file). I hope you have found my responses to be of some value. I now must get on with other things. Best, John Holdren JOHN P.

Or even 300. Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to think that some the participants may have actually slowed their pace a bit. So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution could easily be in the 3000+ range. Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it were sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise. - Gordon","label":0}

{"text":"Finallyyyyyyy. Lots of dealmaking involved. Roberta Jacobson confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Mexico By Seung Min Kim The Senate finally confirmed Roberta Jacobson to be the U.S. ambassador to Mexico on Thursday, ending a months-long delay of her nomination that was ultimately resolved by a complicated deal that drew in two Senate Republicans who had vied for president. Jacobson, a top State Department official, had faced objections from senators related to her work on implementing the Obama administration's controversial policy normalizing relations with Cuba. In November, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who at the time was deep into his presidential run, put a hold on her nomination while publicly criticizing her work at State. But the wheels began to turn toward getting Jacobson installed this month, after Rubio returned to the Senate following his failed presidential bid. Senate GOP leaders and the White House approached Rubio, asking him what would make him lift his Jacobson blockade, according to a Senate aide. Rubio's ask: an extension of a 2014 law he wrote that imposed sanctions on key officials in Venezuela, home to another regime that has been the target of Rubio's wrath. That set up intricate maneuvering with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who said he would block the extension Rubio wanted unless he could get Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to back off his nearly yearlong hold on a separate measure reauthorizing the State Department, according to the Senate aide. Cruz \u2014 who has also been busy campaigning for president \u2014 had put a blanket hold on the legislation and all nominees to the State Department last summer because of the administration's nuclear deal with Iran. But Rubio asked Cruz to drop his hold, according to the Senate aide, in exchange for helping to push legislation Cruz has championed that would rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington the Liu Xiaobo Plaza. That legislation was crucial for Cruz to lift his hold on the State Department nominees in February, although the White House has warned that it would veto Cruz's legislation. Alongside Jacobson's confirmation, the Senate also swiftly cleared the State Department authorization bill for the current fiscal year, as well as Rubio's bill that extended sanctions for three years, in rapid succession Thursday evening. \"The Maduro regime's abuses of power and violations of human rights are hurting innocent people in our hemisphere and threaten the national security interests of the United States,\" Rubio said after the sanctions legislation passed Thursday night. \"We have a responsibility to stand with the Venezuelan people by extending these sanctions.\" The moves ended a nearly yearlong saga over Jacobson's nomination, which had drawn an intraparty rift among Republicans, many of whom supported her despite objections from Cuban-American lawmakers such as Rubio who are vociferously opposed to the administration's Cuba policy. But other Republicans argued that it was unfair to hold Jacobson, whose nomination passed the Foreign Relations Committee in November, hostage over Cuba politics. \"On issues ranging from trade to migration to security and the border, the interests of the United States are served and Arizona benefits when our nation is well-represented in Mexico,\" Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Jacobson's most vocal Republican supporter, said after she was confirmed. \"Though long overdue, I'm pleased that the Senate has confirmed an individual as qualified and capable as Roberta Jacobson to serve as U.S. ambassador to Mexico.\" Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the confirmation in a statement, praising Jacobson's \"tremendous service record in the State Department.\"","label":0}

Audio available HERE . \"Trump's plan would cut millionaires' taxes to the lowest level in modern history. In fact, there's a technical term for Trump's tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires: Yuge. This is a tax plan by the billionaire, for the billionaires... Trump will keep trying to bob and weave. But the problem for him is that his proposal is right there in black and white. It has four full pages of detail. In fact, it's one of the only detailed policy proposals he's put forward in this campaign.\" - senior policy advisor Jake Sullivan \"This is the most risky, reckless and regressive tax proposal ever put forward by a major presidential candidate, and there is not even much disagreement on these basic numbers.... If you look at the Tax Policy Center's analysis, they find that the top 1% would get 40% of the tax cut. The top 0.1%, people making over 5.2 million dollars, would get 18%. So let me give a sense for what this means on how Donald Trump prioritizes the most extremely well-off: the top 0.1% would get more of a tax cut than the bottom 60% of workers combined.\" - former director of the National Economic Council Gene Sperling \"To emphasize, it's not just that his tax policy would be an enormous boon for the most well-off people on Wall Street at the expense of the middle class - he is affirmatively signaling that he would unravel the Dodd-Frank protections that have been put in to ensure we would never have a financial crisis again. That is an extraordinary signal to send, that a Trump presidency would mean more capacity to go back to the type of reckless behavior that most responsible people believe we can never allow again.\" - former director of the National Economic Council Gene Sperling A video released by Hillary for America recapped Trump's plan to hand trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and his proposal to do away with the federal floor for the minimum wage entirely. Video available HERE . Trumponomics : As the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump is trying to make Americans believe his economic policies have undergone a makeover. But his risky plan would hand trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and he says that there should not be a federal floor for the minimum wage. Quite simply, American families cannot afford Donald Trump as president. ### For Immediate Release, May 09, 2016 Contact: press@hillaryclinton.com PAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA Contributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.

Doyle __________________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Broaching a taboo subject Column Robert Legge Independent columnist and resident of Madison County Thursday, August 17, 2006 Suicide 'screening' group going about it the wrong way Normally we'd never have heard about it. But when a man's body was found on a Culpeper golf course, it became news that he had taken his own life. Most suicides are rarely mentioned in local newspapers. Even obituaries hardly ever make such a reference. The stigma is too much. People can't even say the word when it really counts. Too often, suicide is simply written off as the result of mental illness. But it is far more complex than that. Some people voluntarily end their life for pretty rational reasons, such as painful, terminal illness. In fact, white men 85 and over have by far the highest rates of suicide.And while their suicide is traumatic for their friends and family, there is still little public concern for the high rate of this group. There are approximately 30,000 reported suicides a year. Women attempt suicide more often than men, but men are far more successful in large part because they are more likely to use firearms. Suicide rates vary widely throughout the world. The more wealthy nations tend to have the higher rates. Russia, where rampant alcoholism surely plays a part, has the highest rates of all. Suicide is almost unheard of in most poor Latin American countries. A popular myth is that suicides are most common during the holidays. Actually the rate is highest during the spring and lowest during the winter. Lowering the rate of suicide is not easy. It is difficult to differentiate between people who have serious emotional problems but are able to cope and those who eventually take their life. The long list of risk factors could fit most of us, at one time or another. Some of the more serious are access to guns, history of alcohol abuse, physical illness, financial or legal crisis, divorce and depression. Too often our only response if we suspect someone is contemplating suicide is to call the authorities and have the person committed to a mental hospital. This can be traumatic and violent and can result in the person fearing any official intervention. It should be considered a last resort. Another popular myth is that there is an epidemic of children committing suicide. But even in America, with our relatively high suicide rate, teen suicide is rare. Of course that rarity is little consolation to a parent whose child takes his own life. And while teen suicide is far less common than for octogenarians, it still gets the bulk of the concern about suicide prevention. One organization, Teen Screen, that wants to stem the teen suicide rate, advocates suicide \"screening\" for all students nationwide. They conduct what they call a \"diagnostic psychiatric service\" to children as young as 9. Kids are plied with offers of video store discounts to get parental approval to take the screening. Based on their answers to such questions as \"How often did your parents get annoyed or upset with you because of the way you were feeling or acting?\" students may be encouraged to seek \"treatment,\" which usually means drugs. Unfortunately TeenScreen has no evidence that its screening reducing suicide rates. I can't help but be skeptical of the organization's motivation, as its founder and director have had longtime financial ties to the lucrative, psychiatric drug industry. But if all this screening saves one life, isn't it worth it? First off, a 2004 FDA study found that children on an antidepressant were at a greater than twofold increased risk of drug-induced suicidal behavior. Then there are a host of other issues involved in children being labeled mentally ill. None of this is to imply that children have never been helped by drugs or other therapy. But the risks appear to outweigh the benefits of this type of screening, conducted by people who have such close ties to the drug industry.
