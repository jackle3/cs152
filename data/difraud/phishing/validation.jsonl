{"text":"DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz Executive Committee Convention Lunch 5.6.16 - Xfinity LIVE! Brief Welcoming Remarks Good afternoon everyone. Before we conclude today's events I just wanted to take the time once more to thank you all for being here and participating. I hope the day so far has been informative. Let me thank Kevin Washo, Executive Director of the Philadelphia Host Committee Travis Dredd, Deputy CEO for Convention Complex Management Julie Coker Graham from the Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau, and John McNichol from the Philadelphia Convention Center for all your work in getting us ready for July. As you can see, we have a fabulous site for our convention. It's going to give us the opportunity to dazzle the American people as the backdrop to our message. There's lot of hard work ahead, much more planning to do, meetings to attend and troops to rally. But throughout this process, which can seem daunting or even dull at times, I hope we all pause to along the way to remember that all of this is part of a bigger fight for something real. We're fighting for hardworking families who just want the chance to work for a better life. We're fighting to expand opportunity for Americans of every background. We're fighting to end discrimination, raise wages, ensure equal pay for women and level the playing field for all Americans. And to me, there's nothing more exciting than the possibilities of all we can create and accomplish when we fight together. I also never forget that you are the voices of the Democratic Party. You are the leaders in the communities that we need to join our cause in order to win from the top of the ticket down in every race across the country. And that means you can do far more within the groups you represent to get people energized and excited than I, or anyone else can. So I am personally asking you to keep up the good work. Keep bringing more people into our process. Keep putting your energy and enthusiasm - every ounce that you can muster - into this process. This election is shaping up to be a historic one for Democrats - and I'm so proud to be a part of it, but I'm even more proud of all of you for your contributions and dedication. We're going to have a beautiful convention in July. We're going to defeat Dangerous Donald in November. And in January, when we watch the next Democratic president take the oath of office, we can be certain that we've got four more years of real progress ahead. So thank you, thank you, thank you. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce our hardworking, energetic, Pennsylvania Democratic Chair, Marcel Groen. Marcel? [After Chairman Groen Speaks, YOU introduce Rev.

Importance: High * * * * * NOTE: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING... * * * * * With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system. To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers. Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses. In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system. This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th. In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number. (i.e. If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.) We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme. Please instruct the users within your group of this change. All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number. (i.e. If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.) In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend. If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'. Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Drac and Mavis is the center of everything Clearly introducing a baby is dicey and needs to get handled carefully cuz Mavis as a mom is not as relatable and the rel between drac and Dennis is not nearly as important as his relationship with MavisThe study also suggests we need a major song at the end if the movieSome of the things we have cut out of the movie or haven't emphasized enough Is the humanizing of the hotelThe monsters in the real world Mavis as a free spirit torn between two relationships Girly stuff which is in short supplyWe actually had a lot more of this stuff in earlier drafts and I suggest we look at that and see what we can adjust since we sort of almost have timeUnfortunately we probably can't add back the original begining with Mitty judging project runway and frank on a talk showThe opening of drac playing with Mavis's dolls Is good did we cut him spraying the drapes with fresh blood Also it was cute when we had drac saying holy rabbies as that was always what Mavis saidAlso the breath joke was funnier when he was talking to the suit of armour and days seriously it's called flossingIt may be late but Mavis and her romance with jhonny are a big deal and we give the wedding pretty short shrift rand there is very little time in the movie she isn't a. Mom should we consider doing an actual scene here with her maybe there is something else we can cutIs it worth having the scene where jhonny comes to drac to say Mavis wants to talk to you and the scene where she tells him the big newsThere was once a suggestion of planting the idea early that Mavis loved growing up in the castle but worries that if her baby isn't a vampire that she doesn't want it to grow up in Transylvania ... That may be better than having to have a whole scene of spelling it out later If we plant that earlier the emotional story will start when we learn about the fangs at the birthday party and we will be alittle more with Mavis and what she is worried about as well as dracI know we cut scenes to get the movie moving but I do restaurant sceneAnd the shrunken head waking him up like jhonny suggested to see Dennis and the dialogue about batman believe me that will be in the trailer if we have itI also wonder if we really want to cut all the conflict between jhonny and Dracula over making the hotel more suitable for humans this is where so much of the comedy comes from and in stripping it down I'm worried we are gonna have no subtext and all plot because after all the movie is about humans and monsters living together and it was a very clever way of the story reflecting that in every aspect It's not an update of the acts it's about replacing monsters with humans Also the scene where Mavis and drac sing the monster lullaby to Dennis is a big dealThe new scene with the wolf pups willl be good for physical humour but it makes Mavis such a bummer that she is always worried about him getting hurtI'm also not sure why we replaced the scene with Mavis at the buffet with drac and jhonny plotting it was more clever before we just laid everything out in dialogue also do we really want jhonny in the know to this extentAs I have said a million times we need Dracula to be taking him somewhere specific even if they stop off at places along the wayWhat happened to Dracula making the wolf pups chase their tales and putting.

{"text":"Good day, I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9\/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man\ufffds family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50\/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp orate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldn\ufffdt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon. I await your response. Daniel Cole.

{"text":"Dear Chick & all > the first is Keith Briffa's rather comprehensive treatment of getting > climate variations from tree rings: Annual climate variability in > the Holocene: \"interpreting the message of ancient trees\", Quaternary > Science Reviews, 19 (2000) 87-105. It should deal with many of the > questions people raise about using them to determine temperatures. Take this from first principles. A tree only grows on land. That excludes 70% of the earth covered by water. A tree does no grow on ice. A tree does not grow in a desert. A tree does not grow on grassland-savannahs. A tree does not grow in alpine areas. A tree does not grow in the tundra We are left with perhaps 15% of the planet upon which forests grow\/grew. That does not make any studies from tree rings global, or even hemispheric. The width and density of tree rings is dependent upon the following variables which cannot be reliably separated from each other. sunlight - if the sun varies, the ring will vary. But not at night of course. cloudiness - more clouds, less sun, less ring. pests\/disease - a caterpillar or locust plague will reduce photosynthesis access to sunlight - competition within a forest can disadvantage or advantage some trees. moisture\/rainfall - a key variable. Trees do not prosper in a drought even if there's a heat wave. snow packing in spring around the base of the trees retards growth temperature - finally! The tree ring is a composite of all these variables, not merely of temperature. Therefore on the 15% of the planet covered by trees, their rings do not and cannot accurately record temperature in isolation from the other environmental variables. In my article on Greening Earth Society on the Hockey Stick, I point to other evidence which contradicts Mann's theory. The Idso's have produced more of that evidence, and a new article on Greening Earth has 'unearthed' even more. Mann's theory simply does not stack up. But that was not the key issue. Anyone can put up a dud theory from time to time. What is at issue is the uncritical zeal with which the industry siezed on the theory before its scientific value had been properly tested. In one go, they tossed aside dozens of studies which confirmed the existence of the MWE and LIA as global events, and all on the basis of tree rings - a proxy which has all the deficiencies I have stated above. The worst thing I can say about any paper such as his is that it is 'bad science'. Legal restraint prevents me going further. But in his case, only those restraints prevent me going *much* further.

{"text":"Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London James Meek, science correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The Guardian They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants. Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh. \"This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,\" said Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London who discovered the creatures in the UK. The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It's very likely these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental plants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they're here to stay.\" He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has established itself firmly in the same area. Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface. One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact. ------------------------ Yahoo!

The reconstruction is the same as the one I sent on the 5th October 1999, but I'm sending it again in case that e-mail isn't handy. The reconstruction has now been published, in the following paper: Briffa K.R. (2000) Annual climate variability in the Holocene: interpreting the message of ancient trees. Quaternary Science Reviews 19, 87-105. This paper does not, however, give full details about how the reconstruction was obtained. The details are not yet published, but will soon be submitted: Briffa KR, Osborn TJ, Schweingruber FH, Harris IC, Jones PD, Shiyatov SG and Vaganov EA (2000) Low-frequency temperature variations from a northern tree-ring density network. In preparation (to be submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research). Details about the file I'm sending you (repeated from 5th Oct 99): The data are attached to this e-mail. They go from 1402 to 1994, although we usually stop the series in 1960 because of the recent non-temperature signal that is superimposed on the tree-ring data that we use. I haven't put a 40-yr smoothing through them - I thought it best if you were to do this to ensure the same filter was used for all curves. The data I've sent are calibrated over the period 1881-1960 against the instrumental Apr-Sep tempratures averaged over all land grid boxes (that have observed data) that are north of 20N. As such, the mean of our reconstruction over 1881-1960 matches the mean of the observed target series over the same period. Since the observed series consists of degrees C anomalies wrt to 1961-90, we say that the reconstructed series also represents degrees C anomalies wrt to 1961-90. (I've already truncated the series at 1960 because of the problems with the recent period.) Best regards Tim","label":0}

{"text":"From: DNC Press > Reply-To: DNC Rapid Response > Date: Thursday, May 5, 2016 at 11:32 AM To: DNC Press > Subject: DNC Chair Statement Commemorating Cinco de Mayo For Immediate Release 5 de Mayo del 2016 DNC Chair Statement Commemorating Cinco de Mayo Washington, D.C \u2014 DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement commemorating Cinco de Mayo: \"Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862, when a ragtag band of Mexican fighters and workers held back the French Army despite being both out-manned and out-gunned. More than 150 years later, the celebration of Cinco de Mayo represents more than the spirit of resilience and determination that carried that day. Cinco de Mayo is a date that speaks to the intrinsic and close ties between the United States and Mexico. \"Cinco de Mayo celebrations were made popular in California, a reflection of the reality that Mexican-Americans have been a part of our history since before our nation's founding. From the Mexican-Americans who gave rise to great cities like Los Angeles and San Antonio, to those who enrich our country every single day in education, medicine, engineering, sports, agriculture, and in our military, their role in the American landscape has made our country stronger. What Republicans don't get, as they proved today by leaving out mentions of being a welcoming country in their Cinco de Mayo statement, is that Mexican-Americans are not only immigrants but rather a far larger share are Americans \u2013 some with families going back generations -- centuries -- within our borders. \"So as we celebrate a day that reminds us of our shared history, cultural and familial ties, the Democratic Party reaffirms our commitment to exemplifying the values that made America great, and to continuing to fight every single day to ensure our country remains inclusive, while expanding opportunities for all. We celebrate our diversity, and we're proud that our Party and our convention will reflect that. \"That Donald Trump became his Party's presumptive nominee on the eve of Cinco de Mayo is fitting, a reminder of just how wrong his divisive and hateful rhetoric has been since the very first day of his campaign. Today is a reminder that Dangerous Donald would threaten America's relationships with our closest allies, and make our communities less safe. Like the brave souls that day in Puebla a century and a half ago, we must show the spirit and determination every single day between now and November 8th to defeat Trump and his Republican Party in November, and ensure our country continues to live up to our history and our values.\" ###","label":0}

I was frankly very disappointed when I saw the final version--it is overwhelmingly different from the version you shared with us originally. Sadly, it seems to have suffered, and not benefited, from the review process--a very odd scenario. I fault the reviewers as much (in fact more) that I fault you for this. There are some really basic problems that they didn't seem to catch. I hope neither you nor your co-authors take this personally. I'm trying to be as diplomatic as I can be in my discussions w\/ reporters, etc. but I really wish you hadn't sprung this on us w\/ no warning of the dramatic changes that were made. I'm forced to be somewhat critical, because the flaws in some of your conclusions need to be pointed out, or they will be exploited by those w\/ alterior motives. You certainly must have foreseen this, as must have the reviewers. I'm very disappointed, very disappointed indeed. I'm sharing my comments w\/ Keith, Phil, Tim, Tom, Ray, and Malcolm.

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has the ability to insert different sigs on demand. Create a bunch of different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, exmh will load them all. In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign... menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed .signature files for *that* e-mail. You can actually use several if you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows for this). However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into the existing Sedit window prior to composition. I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between. Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the script as your signature. I hope this helps some. -- Seeya, Paul -- It may look like I'm just sitting here doing nothing, but I'm really actively waiting for all my problems to go away.

How about simply: \"Agree with the proxy-based reconstructions within estimated uncertainties (Figure 1)\". and later [middle of the 6th paragraph], \"relative hemispheric warmth during the 10th to 12th centuries\" is ambiguous and we prefer \"relative hemispheric warmth during much of the the 10th,11th and 12th centuries\" yep, better... but also , where we say [just below] \"the specific periods of cold and warm apparent for Europe differ significantly from those for the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.\" , to what evidence of European anomalies are we referring? ahh--I left that open-ended, for Phil and you guys to deal with as you see best.

{"text":"SL: That Didn't Take Long: Latest Anti-Trump Effort Quickly Falls Apart With Donald Trump's recent sweeping victories, it's clear he's the only candidate that can win the Republican nomination. As a result, the GOP remains in chaos and recent developments mean that things won't be getting any better. Last night, Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced they had entered an unusual agreement to save their failing campaigns - dividing their efforts in states with upcoming primaries to stop Trump from clinching more victories. Cruz would focus on Indiana and Kasich would ramp up his efforts in Oregon and New Mexico. Of course, it's too little, too late. Now, less than 24 hours later, the agreement is already falling apart. Today Kasich said : ... he still wants Indiana voters to support him. \"They ought to vote for me,\" he said during a gaggle with reporters at a Philadelphia diner. \"I'm not campaigning in Indiana and he's not campaigning in these other states, that's all. It's not a big deal,\" Kasich said. \"Wow, that didn't take long. Cruz and Kasich's desperate attempt to stay relevant - despite the fact they mathematically have no chance of winning the nomination without plunging their party into further chaos - has already fallen apart. The GOP is still in denial - Trump hasn't taken over the party, their leadership over the years has promoted the divisive policies allowed Trump to flourish.\" - DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach","label":0}

{"text":"April 28, 2016 Contact: Drew Hammill\/Evangeline George 202-226-7616 Pelosi Remarks at Press Availability Following Meeting on Department of Labor Conflict of Interest Rule Washington, D.C. \u2013 Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi delivered remarks today at a press conference with Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, Committee on Financial Services Ranking Member Maxine Waters, Committee on Education and the Workforce Ranking Member Bobby Scott, Congressman Richard Neal and Congressman John Delaney following a meeting with Democratic Members to discuss the Department of Labor's final conflict of interest rule \u2013 a vital measure to protect and strengthen the retirement security and confidence of millions of Americans. Below are the Leader's remarks followed by the question and answer session: \"Good morning, everyone. And it is a good morning, indeed, because we have a cause to celebrate \u2013 not only because it is Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day \u2013 welcome, nice to see you \u2013 but because earlier this month, the Department of Labor unveiled a final rule that will protect and strengthen the retirement security and confidence of millions of Americans. \"The Conflict of Interest Retirement Investment Rule \u2013 also known as the Fiduciary Rule. Hard-working Americans should be able to trust their financial advisor to protect their retirement future. But that's not always been the case. Conflicted advice \u2013 well, I won't go into it, let's just talk on the positive side as to where we are. \"Secretary Perez led an extensive, inclusive, and comprehensive public input process that created this greatly improved final rule: thousands of public comments, days of public hearings, hundreds of stakeholder meetings and more than 100 Congressional meetings with Secretary Perez and his team. \"I just said to our colleagues there, 'Let him be a model to us in having the openness to listen to other ideas, to have the brilliance to recognize a good thing when you see it, and the humility to embrace a solution that you might not have ever thought of yourself' \u2013 and listening to our colleagues, bringing in what the impact, what the ramification is of a particular rule on the private sector is very, very important for us to know. And so, the Secretary told us: he listened, he learned and came up with a better rule and a smarter rule. And that is cause for celebration. \"However, today, Republicans are voting on a special interest resolution to block the rule and upend our progress. Republicans are trying to protect \u2013 well, we will not go into them, let's just stick with us. \"We're very, very honored to have worked on many fronts with the Secretary of Labor. It is Take Your Son to Work Day for him \u2013 his son, Rafael, is with him, and I would have said those remarks, even if Rafael were not here, about his very distinguished father. \"So, I yield the podium to him with gratitude and admiration. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\" *** Q: One question for Leader Pelosi and another question for Secretary Perez. Leader Pelosi, do you expect this will be a campaign issue? Are you urging your Members to make it one? Leader Pelosi. Well, I certainly hope not. I hope that the Republicans will understand and see the light of day that this is an exercise in futility that they are taking up. There are people out there who are watching to see how Congress proceeds on this, but our intention was not \u2013 we wanted to win the issue, not to make it a political issue. Q: And for Secretary Perez, it has been three weeks since the Fiduciary Rule has come out \u2013 there has not been a lawsuit. Do you think that if the case goes on, this lessons the chance that there will be a lawsuit against the rule? Secretary Perez. Well, that's going to be up to someone else. I hope when they review the rule, they will come to the conclusion that they ought to declare victory because the rule is more streamlined as a result of their input, the rule is better as a result of the input. I always enter this enterprise with a healthy dose of humility. And they made us smarter and they made the rule better. And I've talked to so many folks in the industry who have said, 'Thank you for listening, and we can work with this.' You know, there are a few folks \u2013 many of whom who came early on and said, 'This is a solution in search of a problem,' and that's a ridiculous proposition, quite frankly. So, there may still be a few who want to persist, but I have a lot of optimism moving forward that we can continue to work, and we'll work successfully. And if we get sued, we'll be ready for it \u2013 because you know what? Not only is the final product a very good product, but the process leading to the product was an impeccable process and as a result, they don't have a legal leg to stand on in a lawsuit. So, I'd rather have them spend their time on compliance, rather than making it a full employment act for lawyers. But, if they want to do that, we'll be ready. Whip Hoyer. I want to follow up on that because you ask: is it an election issue? What is an election issue is: who is on their side? Who is on the people's side? Who wants to help the people? This rule says, 'We want to make sure that the people have an advocate that is acting in their best interest.' Why would anybody be against that? [Congressman] Richard Neal pointed that out. We all have an agreement on that. Are the Republicans offering this because they don't think we ought to be on their side? Because we don't think the institution has ought to act in their best interest? And the reason I wanted to follow up on this: this is not unique. We have a crisis dealing with Zika, and we're going to walk away tomorrow without solving it. We have a crisis in Puerto Rico, and we're going to walk away tomorrow without solving it. We have a crisis in Flint, Michigan, and we're going to walk away tomorrow without addressing it. This rule is not addressing a real problem \u2013 the rule that is being offered to repeal it and reject the rule. To walk away from the American people \u2013 that, certainly, will be an election year issue. Q: Secretary Perez, I couldn't help but notice that this is a very good issue for a campaign, perhaps, for a Vice Presidential campaign. Do you have any interest in the job? Did you have those conversations in your time here on Capitol Hill? Secretary Perez. This is a very good issue for the average American. And that's what we do at the Department of Labor \u2013 the 'department of opportunity'. We wake up every single day making sure that people have access to the pillars of the middle class, whether it's a good job that pays a fair wage, safe working conditions, access to a healthy and fair retirement. And that's what it's all about and that's my focus every single day and I got 268 days till the weekend. And I'm going to make sure I don't simply count the days but we're going to make every day count whether it's this, whether it's overtime, whether it's the implementation of silica dust, all the things that are part of building an opportunity society and addressing the angst that people feel every single day. Q: Ms. Pelosi, would he make a good Vice President? Leader Pelosi. Well, let's get through the primary first and we know that our next president, whoever she may be, will be thinking very thoughtfully about who the vice president will be. I always like to remind people that the rest of us are wondering what happens if this vice president has to take office \u2013 the person choosing is saying, 'How can I live with this person while I am in office.' So that's a whole other dinner table discussion. Right now, we're focused on America's working families. Again, I salute Secretary Perez, my colleagues, Richard Neal and Mr. Delaney, who \u2013 Mr. Delaney coming from the private sector, understanding how decisions are made, Mr. Neal, who has worked on these issues for a very long time in the Congress, coming at this discussion in a very informed way. We all learned from them, and we're all very proud of the work of our caucus, and we salute the Secretary for that. Q: Congressman Neal, you had sponsored a bill with [Congressman] Peter Roskam that would've gotten rid of this rule. What did the final product do to address your concerns? Congressman Neal. Well, there was a series of things, and I think proprietary interest was addressed, also, the notion that you could sell your own products and the contract was going to be signed at the end of the process. That was a substantial part of what we were proposing, and the Secretary and the Labor Department responded to the request and that's why a bit of surprise when you accomplish the goals you set out to \u2013 why we would be undertaking this proposal today is a bit of a surprise. Q: Have the issues in your legislation been resolved? Congressman Neal. One of the things \u2013 again, one of the things I used to like about signing up for Congress, reporters covered process, as well as the conflict. So, the process has been satisfied and the other, I think, key ingredient here that we want to pay some attention to today is that the response from the Labor Department was satisfactory, and yet, there is another key component here today and the Secretary acknowledged that earlier at the caucus: there is still time for questions to be asked of the Secretary, and they will offer clarification. This is more than 1000 pages. There is a lot of substance in here, and I think as it rolls out, there will be a chance for people to continue to ask questions [and] in their end, find satisfaction or distress. But for the moment, I think that all the questions that we raised \u2013 96 Democrats signed the letter, by-and-large \u2013 they have been satisfied. Q: Would you still vote for that bill if Speaker Ryan brought it to the Floor? Congressman Neal. No I won't. Q: You would not. Whip Hoyer. Thank you. # # # ________________________________ Press Release Link: DemocraticLeader.gov \u2013 Twitter \u2013 YouTube \u2013 Flickr \u2013 Facebook \u2013 The Gavel","label":0}

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a \"market performer\" rating in tech notes 7\/16\/02 Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued.

Ananova: Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists' Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause. Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, \"to keep the pro-hunt thing in the papers\". Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider. In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s. But no-one reported anything to the police. A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but he had seen \"a red blob\" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate. In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any complaints. Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

{"text":"Tom, A few thoughts [1] f This is a link to the longer Thompson et al paper. It isn't yet out in final form - Nov09 maybe? [2] -matching-and-removal-of-natural-variables\/ is a link to wattsupwiththat - not looked through this apart from a quick scan. Dave Thompson just emailed me this over the weekend and said someone had been busy! They seemed to have not fully understood what was done. Have looked at the plots. I'm told that the HadSST3 paper is fairly near to being submitted, but I've still yet to see a copy. More SST data have been added for the WW2 and WW1 periods, but according to John Kennedy they have not made much difference to these periods. Here's the two ppts I think I showed in Boulder in June. These were from April 09, so don't know what these would look like now. SH is on the left and adjustment there seems larger, for some reason - probably just British ships there? Maybe I'm misinterpreting what you're saying, but the adjustments won't reduce the 1940s blip but enhance it. It won't change the 1940-44 period, just raise the 10 years after Aug 45. I expect MOHC are looking at the NH minus SH series re the aerosols. My view is that a cooler temps later in the 1950s and 1960s it is easier to explain. Land warming in the 1940s and late 1930s is mainly high latitude in NH. One other thing - MOHC are also revising the 1961-90 normals. This will likely have more effect in the SH. With the SH around 1910s there is the issue of exposure problems in Australia - see Neville's paper. This shouldn't be an issue in NZ - except maybe before 1880, but could be in southern South America. New work in Spain suggest screens got renewed about 1900, so maybe this happened in Chile and Argentina, but Mossmann was head of the Argentine NMS so he may have got them to use Stevenson screens early. Neville has never been successful getting any OZ funding to sort out pre-1910 temps everywhere except Qld. Here's a paper in CC on European exposure problems. There is also one on Spanish series. Cheers Phil At 06:25 28\/09\/2009, Tom Wigley wrote: Phil, Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs to partly explain the 1940s warming blip. If you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip (as I'm sure you know). So, if we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, 0.15 degC, then this would be significant for the global mean -- but we'd still have to explain the land blip. I've chosen 0.15 here deliberately. This still leaves an ocean blip, and i think one needs to have some form of ocean blip to explain the land blip (via either some common forcing, or ocean forcing land, or vice versa, or all of these). When you look at other blips, the land blips are 1.5 to 2 times (roughly) the ocean blips -- higher sensitivity plus thermal inertia effects. My 0.15 adjustment leaves things consistent with this, so you can see where I am coming from. Removing ENSO does not affect this. It would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip, but we are still left with \"why the blip\". Let me go further. If you look at NH vs SH and the aerosol effect (qualitatively or with MAGICC) then with a reduced ocean blip we get continuous warming in the SH, and a cooling in the NH -- just as one would expect with mainly NH aerosols. The other interesting thing is (as Foukal et al. note -- from MAGICC) that the 1910-40 warming cannot be solar. The Sun can get at most 10% of this with Wang et al solar, less with Foukal solar. So this may well be NADW, as Sarah and I noted in 1987 (and also Schlesinger later). A reduced SST blip in the 1940s makes the 1910-40 warming larger than the SH (which it currently is not) -- but not really enough. So ... why was the SH so cold around 1910? Another SST problem? (SH\/NH data also attached.) This stuff is in a report I am writing for EPRI, so I'd appreciate any comments you (and Ben) might have. Tom.

{"text":"By Dan Diamond | 05\/04\/2016 10:00 AM EDT Three Oregon insurers are asking for average rate hikes of at least 29.6 percent, and researchers say medical errors could be the nation's third-leading cause of death. But first: A dire new warning of the risk of Zika virus. PAHO ON ZIKA: 500 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE AMERICAS AT RISK - Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, the Zika incident manager for the Pan American Health Organization, said Tuesday that half a billion people in the Americas are at risk of being infected by the Zika virus. Aldighieri and NIAID Director Anthony Fauci briefed reporters at PAHO headquarters in Washington on the status of the Zika response. Both warned that they expect to see an influx in cases in the coming months, Pro's Brianna Ehley reports. - Vaccine developments: Researchers are preparing a vaccine study to begin in September and should be able to determine if the vaccine is ready to test on groups of people at the beginning of 2017, Fauci said. If so, the vaccine will be tested first in an infected country and might be ready for widescale use in anywhere from one to three years. Fauci repeated warnings that Congress must approve the full sum requested by the administration if it is to be prepared to respond to Zika and other health crises. \"We cannot do the job that's necessary to be done,\" he said. \"The president asked for $1.9 billion because we need $1.9 billion.\" WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE - Where we hope you're not having these side effects from Abilify.

FEDS: STATE FILES LAWSUIT OVER COLLAPSED CO-OP - Iowa on Tuesday sued the federal government to recover millions it believes are owed to a nonprofit insurance startup seeded with Obamacare loan dollars that collapsed after running up huge losses, Pro's Paul Demko reports. - How it quickly went bust: CoOportunity Health received $147 million in startup loans from the federal government under the Affordable Care Act. It collapsed in December 2014 after losing $163 million that year. - Details of the lawsuit: Iowa's insurance commissioner says that CoOportunity is owed $130 million in \"risk corridor\" funds, but has not received any of that money. That program was established to protect insurers entering the exchanges from big losses, but initially paid out only 12.6 percent of anticipated payments because congressional Republicans imposed restrictions. - One key goal: The lawsuit seeks to invalidate claims by the Obama administration that the federal government should have \"super priority\" status in recovering funds it's owed by CoOportunity Health, which did business in Iowa and Nebraska. \"The federal government has tried to jump to the head of the creditor line, but is not following Iowa or federal law in withholding over $20 million due to CoOportunity,\" Iowa's insurance commissioner Nick Gerhart said in a statement. OREGON INSURERS PROPOSE RATE INCREASES - Nine of the 10 insurers that participate on the state's ACA insurance exchange are asking for average rate increases of at least 15 percent, and three are requesting average rate hikes of at least 29.6 percent. See the proposed rates: 1.usa.gov\/1WHeXVj MEDICAL ERRORS MAY BE THIRD-LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH - That's according to a new BMJ study, which concludes that more than 250,000 Americans die per year because of surgical errors, inaccurate diagnoses and even communication breakdowns. According to the researchers, led by Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary, the exact toll of medical errors is difficult to quantify because of how they're reported and recorded. In an open letter, they call on CDC to update how it tracks medical errors on death certificates. \"Creating one additional field on the death certificate form to inquire if immediately preventable complications stemming from the patient's medical care was the primary contributor to the patient's death would advance the science of safety,\" they write The CDC's Bob Anderson told ProPublica that the agency's approach to tracking mortality data is consistent with international guidelines. It would be difficult to change \"unless we had a really compelling reason to do so,\" he said. Read the study:  Top causes of death in 2014, per CDC . Heart disease: 614,348 deaths .

He'll tour local facilities, take part in a roundtable discussion, give a speech, meet with local leaders - and drink the water, if Gov. Rick Snyder gets his way. \"We are hopeful the president will drink the water in Flint, to help reinforce Gov. Snyder's actions and the EPA's message that filtered Flint water is safe to drink,\" Snyder's spokesperson said in a media statement. State of recovery. In the four months since Flint was declared a federal emergency, workers armed with blood tests and resources - including bottles of water - have poured into the city. But tens of millions of dollars in federal support are still being held up in the legislative process, and while Michigan will expand Medicaid coverage to an additional 15,000 Flint residents next week, the effort has been delayed for weeks. HOW RICK SNYDER'S INNER CIRCLE FAILED ON FLINT - MLive.com is out with an in-depth investigation of how the Flint crisis unfolded and who knew what - and when. The article concludes that Gov. Snyder's once-praised corporate management style became his downfall. \"A year ago ... Snyder was stoking rumors of a presidential bid as a metrics-driven Republican whose ability to run government like a business transformed a troubled state,\" the article begins. \"Now, he is viewed as the person ultimately responsible for one of the nation's biggest public-health disasters in memory - the lead contamination of a water system serving 100,000 people, and a possible link between the water system and an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease that killed 12 people.\" Read the story:  ** A message from PhRMA: Developing innovative medicines is not possible without the people who volunteer to participate in clinical trials.

While the sidecar hasn't been formally unveiled, it's also not quite a secret. Several House committees have already approved bills that will make up the package, with Medicaid, Obamacare and Dodd-Frank some of the biggest targets. Here's a roundup of the health care implications. - The Energy and Commerce backed legislation to reduce federal contributions to the State Children's Health Insurance Program; eliminate the prevention and public health fund under Obamacare; tweak Medicaid provider taxes, provide less funds to states for providing Medicaid health care to prison inmates; and prohibit multimillion-dollar jackpot lottery winners of being eligible for Medicaid. - The Ways and Means Committee approved bills to eliminate the Social Services block grant; and recover Obamacare subsidy overpayments. - The Judiciary Committee approved a bill to limit damages from medical malpractice lawsuits. BROOKINGS CAUTIOUS ON PART B DEMO - Kavita Patel and Caitlin Brandt write that Medicare's planned Part B pilot to change how the program pays for drugs is well-intentioned, but could cause unintended complications. For instance, the Brookings Institution researchers warn that the Part B demo is competing with a new oncology care model that's also trying to improve payment, and there needs to be an exemption for organizations participating in the cancer pilot. They also caution that CMS needs to anticipate the potential consequences related to geographic stratification. \"It is possible to imagine organizations with multiple locations directing patients to optimal sites for their business,\" they argue, citing a Drug Channels blog post. Read the Brookings post:  IMS, QUINTILES THE LATEST HEALTH CARE MEGA-MERGER - The two firms on Tuesday announced plans to merge in a nearly $9 billion deal. IMS Health specializes in health care information and technology, while Quintiles works with pharmaceutical companies on clinical trial research.

Prince's representatives called Howard Kornfeld, a nationally known specialist in opioid addiction, on the night of April 20 with an urgent medical request. Kornfeld wasn't able to immediately make the trip from California, but sent his son - who arrived at Prince's estate on the morning of April 21, helped find Prince unconscious and reportedly was the one who called 911.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD BACKS STRICKLAND IN OHIO - Planned Parenthood today is endorsing former governor Ted Strickland in his Ohio Senate race against sitting Sen. Rob Portman. The organization's endorsement is one of its first of the cycle, and its announcement focused as much on bashing Portman as it did on backing Strickland. \"Senator Rob Portman has voted to severely restrict access to these critical services at Planned Parenthood health centers and shamefully dismissed reproductive care as illegitimate,\" Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards said in a statement.

{"text":"Dear chapter 6 friends, I have a request on procedure. In the interest of a good and constructive working atmosphere, I would suggest that all of us focus on sober scientific arguments and refrain from unneccessarily derogatory comments about the work of colleagues. I'm referring in this case to David's comment - this reference is overused, especially for such a simplistic model The reference concerned is our theory of DO events which appeared in Nature in 2001 and has since been cited 133 times according to the Web of Science (a sign of overuse?) The model concerned is the CLIMBER-2 model, featured in over 50 peer-reviewed publications since 1998, including 7 in Nature and Science. This model is different from David's model, because it has been constructed for a differenet purpose, but it is not \"simplistic\". It would never occur to me to call David's model \"simplistic\" because it does not include an interactive continental ice sheet model, vegetation model, carbon cycle model, sediment model and isotope model. I'm absolutely open to any rational scientific criticism and discussion, but I can see no purpose in derogatory statements like the above, which include not even a trace of scientific argument. This kind of thing only poisons the working atmosphere in our group, which I thought was very positive and a great pleasure in Beijing.

There is so much at stake in this election and we hope you will use this event as an opportunity to put your support behind the DNC. Donald Trump -- and all of the backwards, offensive, outrageous ideas that come with him -- is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee. A Trump presidency would reverse all that we have worked to accomplish during President Obama's administration. Obamacare, marriage equality, and our economic growth would all be threatened by such a volatile leader and we cannot allow his messages of fear and hatred to take over our country. There are just 77 days until the Philadelphia Convention and 182 days until the general election. Help us ensure that we have the resources needed to help Democrats win. We need your help to make sure Donald Trump is not elected the next President of the United States this November.

{"text":"Why Charter's Proposed Buyout of Time Warner Cable is all About the Future of OTT Why Charter's Proposed Buyout of Time Warner Cable is all About the Future of OTT Charter Communications first proposed buying Time Warner Cable (TWC) on 24 June 2013. Since then, the two companies have communicated on 11 separate occasions, each time with TWC rejecting Charter's advances. It is certainly interesting to ask whether this proposed acquisition will take place, and we think we know the answer to that, but there is a more important question at stake which is - what will be the source of long-term value in a future merged company? There are only four potential sources of value in a cable network operator: The network (i.e. the physical infrastructure used to distribute the content from the network operations centre to the customer's premises); The content (i.e. programming that the cable network operator owns and can therefore license to other distributors); Ancillary services that can be delivered using the cable network (e.g. high-speed internet and phone service); Value-added services that span multiple connected devices and allow the user to enjoy their services and content on an 'anytime, anywhere' basis. Read on to find out which of these four sources of value will provide lasting value, and also why the cable network operator of the future will be forced into doing deals with OTT players like Netflix, Google, Apple and others.

Common features in present definitions of vulnerability Vulnerability is a multi-dimensional concept that has been a topic of study in many different scientific disciplines, ranging from anthropology and psychology to economics and ecology. As such, it has been defined and assessed in many different ways for many different purposes. The scientific literature provides many examples of vulnerability assessments, each with their own explicit or (more often) implicit interpretations of what vulnerability means to the object of study. In spite of this diversity the various interpretations of vulnerability have a number of things in common: 1. Vulnerability is always an attribute of a system, in the broadest meaning of the term. Systems that may be vulnerable include individual people, communities, countries, economic sectors, landscapes, resources, ecosystems and so on. Importantly, in ATEAM the system of interest is not ecosystems per se but the set of functions that ecosystems perform in providing goods and services to human society. 2. Vulnerability always refers to some potential of or exposure to harm or damage. It is therefore meaningful to specify exactly to which forcing a system is thought to be vulnerable. In ATEAM multiple forcings are considered, all related in some way to global change. In response to needs expressed by the European Commission these forcings are the increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2, the climate change that is the result of this increasing concentration, as well as the effects of changing land use and land-use policies. 3. Definitions of vulnerability tend to capture some notion of the extent to which the system would be unable to avoid, defend itself against, cope with, adjust to or otherwise prevent or minimise potential harm or damage. This mechanism of damage prevention or minimisation (termed adaptation in the context of climate change) is important because it defines the difference between the potential harm or damage and the actual or residual impacts that will occur. It can be argued that if a stress-exposed system has the ability to avert the potentially severe impacts that could ensue from this stress, then it is not vulnerable (footnote 1). The first assessments of vulnerability to climate change (such as the First and Second Assessment Reports of the IPCC and many national vulnerability studies) were carried out without considering adaptation as an important aspect of vulnerability. These assessments implicitly assumed present- day behaviour and activities to continue unchanged in the future, irrespective of how they would be affected by climate change. By ignoring adaptation these studies did not distinguish between potential and residual impacts and thus their results represented serious overestimates of the system\\u2019s vulnerability. On the other hand, the studies served to generate awareness of the potential magnitude of impacts and of the need for adaptation. A recent discussion of vulnerability: the IPCC Working Group II Each of the aforementioned features of vulnerability was incorporated in the proposed definition of vulnerability in the IPCC Working Group II Third Assessment Report, which was as follows: The degree to which a system is sensitive to and unable to cope with adverse impacts of climatic stimuli. Vulnerability is a function of a system\\u2019s exposure and its adaptive capacity. However, the IPCC Working Group II Plenary meeting in Geneva (13\\u201316 February 2001) adopted a somewhat modified and expanded definition in the final, government-approved version of the Summary for Policymakers. The adopted definition no longer captures the important notion that vulnerability depends on both potential impacts and the inability to cope with these impacts, as was indicated by the word \\u201cand\\u201d in the first sentence of the above definition: The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climatic change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity. Building blocks for a definition to be used in ATEAM The former definition of vulnerability captures the various aspects of vulnerability discussed above but it is likely to be too broad to be made operational in ATEAM. ATEAM addresses the interaction between ecosystems and society and in particular the provision of goods and services by ecosystems for human use. Of relevance to ATEAM are therefore not only the exposure and adaptive capacity of ecosystems to climate change but also the adaptive capacity of human systems in relation to a change in the provision of ecosystem goods and services. To develop a meaningful definition of vulnerability for ATEAM it could be useful to explore a number of related concepts: risk, sustainability and resilience. A relatively widely accepted interpretation of risk is that it is a function of the probability of occurrence of an event combined with an estimate of the magnitude of its impact. For example, in the context of species conservation risk can be seen as a measure of the probability that a negative event (i.e., a threat) combined with the individual species\\u2019 response to these events (i.e., an indicator of species\\u2019 vulnerability) would lead a species to extinction (Ara\u00fajo and Williams, 2000). Amongst the many definitions of sustainability, a useful one is based on the conservation and substitutability of different types of capital: human-made capital, natural capital, human capital and social capital (Serageldin and Steer, 1994). Sustainable development, of which the most widely used definition is \\u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\\u201d (WCED, 1987), prescribes that the total stock of capital does not decrease over time. Whether or not substitution and compensation of different types of capital are allowed depends on the preferred level of sustainability (cf. weak versus strong sustainability). The relationship between sustainability and ecosystem vulnerability is based on the extent to which external forcings lead to a decrease in natural capital and thus in the potential of ecosystems to provide goods and services for human use. A possible (anthropocentric) definition of sustainability in the context of ATEAM could therefore be: The ability of an ecosystem to provide humans with goods and services in the present, without compromising the ability of future human generations to obtain these ecosystem goods and services in the future. The concept of resilience is well known in ecology, although two distinct interpretations of the term exist. As defined by Holling (1973), resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes and still persist. According to Pimm (1984), however, resilience describes the speed with which a system returns to its original state following a perturbation. Holling (1973), on the other hand, considered this to be the stability of a system, whilst Pimm (1984) referred to stability as the combination of resilience, resistance, persistence and variability. In an attempt to define the resilience of the Dutch coast, Klein et al. (1998) distinguished between a morphological, an ecological and a socio-economic component of coastal resilience, each of which represents another aspect of the coastal system\\u2019s capacity to cope with perturbations. They described coastal resilience as a measure of the extent to which a coast is able to respond to external pressures without losing actual or potential functions: The resilience of the coast is its self-organising capacity to preserve actual and potential functions of coastal systems under the influence of changing hydraulic and morphological conditions. This capacity is based on the (potential) dynamics of morphological, ecological and socio- economic processes in relation to the demands that are made by the functions to be preserved. Given the focus of ATEAM on ecosystem services, we might want to work towards a similar type of definition of vulnerability, whereby vulnerability could be described in terms of the likelihood that an ecosystem loses a significant amount of its capacity to provide goods and services that are important to society. A definition that includes the temporal dimension of global change and sustainability could describe vulnerability in terms of the risk of ecosystem sustainability being compromised. Before suggesting a \\u201cfinal\\u201d definition, however, we would like to invite views and suggestions from the entire ATEAM consortium.

Lockrgnome's Top 50 Mac OS X Tips is in publication and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list has improved my personal OS X experience. Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the \"Review by\" links at the bottom of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris and Randy. I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. Either way, I'm open to some AppleScript suggestions.

{"text":"Mike I am off to Finland for a week but I am sending you (via Tim) a copy of a draft perspectives piece for Science on you recent 1000-year reconstruction paper . They want to run it in early May I think and I have been told I will see their edited draft on my return. The idea was to make a wider comment that just report on your latest curve so I decided to mention uncertainties in tree-ring data while pushing the need for more work on high-resolution proxies and especially interpretive work in the very recent context of high temperatures and other possible anthropogenic environmental disturbance. The trouble is that they would only give us 1000 words and one Figure. Anyway this Figure now contains a selection of various large-scale temperature average series - all recalibrated against northern warm season (april-sept) average land data north of 20 degrees north. This is just to provide a convenient common scale - all the original season \/area references are given. You will see that this brings phil's curve nicely back in line and the correct (low frequency ) density curve now fits better also. I have taken the opportunity to put our new longish (2000-year)tree-ring width curve in representing the north of Europe\/Siberia . This is the average of Tornetrask(Sweden) and Yamal and Taimyr(Siberia ) - all processed to retain low-frequency variance. These curves and a similar average incorporating all the Northern tree-ring data (not including the large density set) are in my paper for the Pages open science meeting publication. Tim and I will produce a short paper describing the new low-frequency density curve , probably for Geophysical Research Letters. For the meantime I hope you think the perspectives piece is O.K. Let me know if you have any problems with it - but remember that they are going to hack it about anyway. By the way, how did you compare the high-elevation (PC1) timeseries with Jacoby and D'Arrigo's northern treeline data in your paper when the latter only go back to 1671 ? Did you use their reworked Gidding's dataset for Alaska? Thanks for the message on the IPCC stuff . I am happy to write any additional bits or make suggestions . Sorry I did not get back to you last time but I was confused about the timetable . Thanks for putting my name on the list. I will make comments again as soon as I see the next draft.

{"text":"Chick, look at the instrumental record! there are huge differences between different regions - Alaska has warmed substantially while eastern North America cooled after the 1950s. locking onto local records, no matter how beautiful, can lead to serious errors. If the ice cores are so infallible why do they give substantially different stories for grip and gisp2 over the last 1500 years? the bottom line is that one cannot make a robust case that decadally hemispheric temperatures over the last 1500 years were even as warm as the late 20th century, much less warmer.

Cc: Tortolero, Elio; Boe, Larry A. (Lawrence); Sommers, Jeffrey E.; Walls Jr., Rob; Donahue, Jeff; Lundstrom, Bruce; Romero, Isabel Subject: Weekly Report Stan\/Jim, Following is a list of last week's most salient events. Central America\/DR: Guatemala: MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the reduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million. It is possible they will ask for additional information. Nicaragua: Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to sweep the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped by the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project). Partners to reimburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will be approximately $2.2 million. Team tried to get MARAD to agree to alternative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and political implications. Panama: Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elektra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama). Three issues are worth noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) will likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its own although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's marginal costs are among highest in Panama. A preliminary strategy has been mapped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit \"one-sided\" in favor of the distributor. BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the distco to change terms without success. Dominican Republic: El Paso confirmed it can't work with us. Operationally, the plant is working well. As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel supplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms. Enron rejected the request. SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol. We are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues. Ecoelectrica: This week was a very productive week. Update as follows: Lender Process: Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they understand that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions. Lenders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 million coverage. Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles. Lenders appear content with that option. ENE insurance has approximately 75% of the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional $200 million tranche. Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kick back existing coverage. Mirant to issue a certification of compliance with QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap. Based on the progress this week and the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the lender group by Tuesday of next week. Finally, Mirant also committed to providing comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement. ENE and EME have reviewed and provided comments already. GE Consent: Mirant committed to sending their \"versions\" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday nite (late). I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated that the documents are \"conforming\". Union Carbide Guarantee: Plan to finalize language early next week. Schedule: Mirant has committed to fulfilling CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we can allow them to fund on 12\/19. They state they are confident they can close CP's by earlier than 12\/14 and can fund on 12\/19. CSFB has not shed light on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investigate further. APACHI Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and negotiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fast enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event. Nevertheless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12\/15 agreement date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year. Guam: Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting them over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event. Work continues. Meetings have been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project. China: Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11\/23. Two likely causes still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw). Work on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with Houston to ensure consensus. In the mean time, several parties have approached us with interest in Chengdu. On Hainan, team is paying several visits to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayment ($10 million). Next step would be liquidation. Europe Gaza: Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to provide limited technical support and financial services support to help put in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction activities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligations. Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guarantees. Trakya: During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy. Government stated they would \"clean up\" arrears but could not do so before January 2002 (presumably there are no budget funds left). Government committed to work with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the legal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properly and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backing it needed to give the issue resolution. OPIC agreed to send the Government \"terms of reference\" on their conceptual agreements. On our question of change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they would expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed position against it. Sarlux: team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's claim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on November 30th. Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at the plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials. ENS: local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over final completion certificate. Issue was related to CO2 emmissions on GT12 vs the EPC contract parameters. Team has convinced the lender's engineer that issue is of no relevance. Team is now moving to secure lender approval. This releases $1.95 million of contingent support by ENE. Europe Sales Prospects: IPower submitted preliminary proposals for ENS and Trakya, both well below expectations. Other: Team is working closely with RAC to come up with updated fair market valuations, cashflow projections by month for the quarter ended Dec. 31, and revised\/updated transfer restriction information.

{"text":"Core Java Technologies Technical Tips View this issue as simple text September 10, 2002 In this Issue WELCOME to the Core JavaTM Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you'll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM). Using ArrayList and LinkedList Using Zero-Length Arrays These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4. This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey. USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST ArrayList and LinkedList are two Collections classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an ArrayList of Strings, or a LinkedList of Integers. This tip compares the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation. The first key point is that an ArrayList is backed by a primitive Object array. Because of that, an ArrayList is much faster than a LinkedList for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the get method. Note that the get method is implemented for LinkedLists, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a LinkedList, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list. Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound. Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo1 { static final int N = 10000; static List values; \/\/ make List of increasing Integer values static { Integer vals[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i = minval && indata[i] = minval && indata[i] <= maxval) { outdata[j++] = indata[i]; } } return outdata; } public static void main(String args[]) { \/\/ set up test array of integers int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59}; \/\/ filter out values not in the range 1-10 int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10); for (int i = 0; i < outdata1.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata1[i]); } \/\/ filter out values not \/\/ in the range 100-200 int outdata2[] = filterData( indata, 100, 200); for (int i = 0; i < outdata2.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata2[i]); } } } The filterData method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. The result of running the ZeroDemo1 program is: 1 3 8 Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72) The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of filterData returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values: \/* if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } *\/ When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated: int outdata[] = new int[0]; This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. For the ZeroDemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this: int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; if (validcnt == 0) { return outdata; } Note that usage such as: int outdata[] = new int[]{}; is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants. In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows: private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = new int[0]; This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo2 { public static void main(String args[]) { \/\/ set up ArrayList and add strings to it List stringlist = new ArrayList(); stringlist.add(\"string 1\"); stringlist.add(\"string 2\"); stringlist.add(\"string 3\"); \/\/ convert to String array String out[] = ( String[])stringlist.toArray( new String[0]); for (int i = 0; i < out.length; i++) { System.out.println(out[i]); } } } The result of running the ZeroDemo2 program is: string 1 string 2 string 3 The ZeroDemo2 program sets up an ArrayList, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls toArray to get a String array of the three elements in the ArrayList. In this example, the argument to toArray is \"new String[0]\". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a String array that's big enough to hold the elements of the ArrayList, you can specify it as the argument to toArray. The method will use the String array. But if your array is not big enough, then the toArray method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. ArrayList stores its element references in an Object array. The toArray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance) to create an array of the appropriate type.

And it's not a partisan issue\u2014two of the laws were signed by Republican Governors Bruce Rauner of Illinois and Chris Christie of New Jersey. These laws prohibit mental health professionals from subjecting LGBT minors to \"therapy\" practices that attempt to change their sexual orientation or gender identity. Medical organizations such as the American Psychological Association reject gay conversion therapy. The harmful effects on LGBT youth can lead to depression, substance abuse, homelessness, anxiety and suicide. In addition to today's anti-LGBT vote, Forrester has also refused to condemn North Carolina's discriminatory anti-LGBT law, even after local business leaders called on her to confirm she would not sign similar legislation were she to be elected governor. The letter called on each of the Republican candidates\u2014State Senator Forrester, Executive Councilor Chris Sununu, State Representative Frank Edelblut and Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas\u2014to denounce anti-LGBT laws and state publicly they'd veto similar legislation were they to be elected governor. Buckley concluded, \"Vote after vote, the Republican candidates are showing just how out-of-touch they are with mainstream Granite Staters.\" ### [ Share [ Tweet [ Forward unsubscribe from this list update subscription preferences Paid for by the New Hampshire Democratic Party.

{"text":"Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: The Des Moines Register observes that Sen. Chuck Grassley's Supreme Court obstruction is jeopardizing his legacy, President Obama calls on Senate Republicans to fill the Supreme Court vacancy in light of Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Chief Judge Garland reflects on his lifetime of public service and, today's Supreme Court decisions showcase the need for a fully functional, nine person bench. Tomorrow, #WeNeedNine will host a press conference at Capitol Visitor Center - SVC 202, with Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers, Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, President of the National Education Association, Elizabeth A. Davis, President Washington Teachers Union, and Jim Leonard, U.S. government teacher at Wilson High School in DC to mark the 62 anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. They will demand Senate Republicans move forward with hearings and an up-or-down vote on Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court. To RSVP for this event, please email Natalie Raps at nraps@skdknick.com . Editorial: Grassley's court maneuver threatens his legacy, reputation. The editorial board of the Des Moines Register writes: \"After 57 years in elected office and countless legislative accomplishments at both the state and federal level, Grassley seems destined to be remembered largely for this single, petulant act of politically motivated obstructionism... Over the course of six terms in the U.S. Senate, three terms in the U.S. House, and 16 years in the Iowa Legislature, Grassley cultivated a reputation for being a fair-minded, hard-working, bipartisan lawmaker. That well-deserved reputation is now badly damaged - perhaps irretrievably so.\" President Obama: Trump candidacy a key reason to confirm Garland now Today, President Obama weighed in on Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, saying it should incentivize Senate Republicans to confirm Chief Judge Garland now. In a live interview with Chris Geidner, Buzzfeed reports: \"The GOP is 'looking at a Republican nominee' - Donald Trump - 'who many of them say isn't qualified to be president much less appoint someone' to the Supreme Court.... But now, 'it seems to me [Republicans would] be better off going ahead and giving a hearing and a vote to somebody that they themselves in the past have said is well-qualified, is fair, and to treat the Supreme Court with the seriousness and the sense that it's beyond politics, that it deserves,' Obama said. 'Precisely because this election year has been so crazy, precisely because you have a number of Republicans who have said that they're concerned about their nominee, it shows you why you don't want to politicize a Supreme Court appointment.'\" Supreme Court punts on major case, showing the importance of a full and functioning high court. In a memo, People for the American Way notes that the Supreme Court's decision to send Zubik v. Burwell-a major case concerning the Affordable Care Act-back to the lower courts highlights the crucial importance of a fully functioning Supreme Court. \"The Supreme Court issued a brief unsigned opinion today in the Zubik case, and vacated all the conflicting opinions...The result is to punt the issue away until the Court again has nine justices...While both sides can therefore claim some temporary victory from the Court's ruling, the clear loser is our American justice system.\" Chief Judge Garland: the committed tutor. Teacher Charlene Wilburn reflects on the 18 years Chief Judge Garland spent tutoring students at J.O. Wilson Elementary. Watch the video HERE . Charlene Wilburn, teacher at J.O. Wilson Elementary: \"The fact that he would continue to come with his busy schedule and his big job to take the time to work with children, it just really touches my heart-and I really think it speaks to him, what kind of person he is. For him to be a judge for the Supreme Court is perfect.\" Senate Republicans can learn something from New Hampshire. Former New Hampshire state representative and senator Debora B. Pignatelli writes in the New Hampshire Business Review that the Senate GOP should take a lesson from a NH state law that requires all state judicial nominees to receive a public hearing. Former New Hampshire state representative and senator Debora B. Pignatelli: \"When I was a New Hampshire state senator, my colleagues, both Republican and Democratic, enacted a bill I co-sponsored that required all state judicial nominees receive a public hearing. It has served our state well...Instead of continuing to obstruct, the Senate Republican leadership should give Chief Judge Garland a hearing and a vote... Our belonging to a political party didn't make any difference. We did our jobs. The hearings were important to ensure the public had the opportunity to vet a nominee's qualifications and record. There were no political shenanigans.\" A look ahead at a sampling of activity by our grassroots allies and Democratic Senators: TUESDAY 5\/17\/16 Event: Senator Cardin, Education Leaders Demand Senate GOP Move Forward on Filling Supreme Court Vacancy Additional Information: On the 62 Anniversary of the Brown v.

{"text":"Simon, If you go to this web page [1] You can click on a re-evaluation of MBH, which leads to a paper submitted to Climatic Change. This shows that MBH can be reproduced. The R-code to do this can be accessed and eventually the data - once the paper has been accepted. IPCC will likely conclude that all MM arguments are wrong and have been answered in papers that have either come out or will soon. MBH is just one curve of many - more now than there were in 2001. MBH is still in the spaghetti of curves, and is not an outlier. If there are outliers it will be Esper et al. and another one. Bristlecones are only crucial to the issue if you are MM. They misused them, by their PCA application. This is all well-known to those in the know. I have reviewed the CC paper by Wahl and Ammann. It reproduces all the mistakes MM have made, so they know how and why their results have been achieved. I can send you the paper if you want, subject to the usual rules. MBH have all responded to the same requests as IPCC got from the US Senate. Their responses are all posted at [2] The skeptics have shot themselves in the foot over this one. Cheers Phil At 15:17 29\/07\/2005, Tim Osborn wrote: At 14:27 28\/07\/2005, Tett, Simon wrote: John Houghton is being quized by bits of the US senate. One question is \"Whats the status of the review of the Mann hockey stick temperature curve? I understand that studies by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick suggest that it relied on the statistically insignificant bristlecone pine. Is the IPCC taking another look at that work, which forms the basis for much of todays climate change debate?\" My current thoughts on an answer is to say that other reconstructions show a similar pattern (though not magnitude). However how many of the other reconstructions use the bristlecone data? [I suspect yours does not] Hi Simon - I was away yesterday, so couldn't answer then. Hopefully it isn't too late to answer today. (1) I don't understand what they mean by describing the bristlecone pine as \"statistically insignificant\". (2) The Mann, Bradley and Hughes (MBH1999) reconstruction is only one small piece of information in today's climate change debate. (3) As far as I understand, then yes the MBH1999 reconstruction does give quite a lot of weight to a few western US tree-ring series, which are mostly bristlecone pines for the longest records. (4) Other reconstructions show similar shape (though not magnitude) and support similar conclusions (regarding the unprecedented nature of recent warmth\/warming trend). This is the main argument to make, as you thought. Some of these other reconstructions do not include these bristlecones (e.g. Briffa, 2000; Crowley et al., 2003; Moberg et al., 2005; Briffa et al., 2001). Crowely and Moberg use different Bristlecone records I think. Other reconstructions do use the same Bristlecone pines (e.g., Mann and Jones, 2004). BUT the critical thing is that the studies either do not use these Bristlecone pines, or if they do use them, then they give them much more similar weighting to the other records used. I think MBH1999 is the only one that might give them a dominant weighting. (5) IPCC is assessing all published work that relates to these issues in preparation for the AR4 in 2007. This includes the McIntyre and McKitrick papers as well as papers that report results contrary to McIntyre\/McKitrick, such as the paper in press by Wahl and Amman that shows the Mann et al. results are reproducible. cc'd for additional comments to Phil and Keith (when he's back).

If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis, these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance. But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable. Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users are not affected. Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully, this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users. Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail program open to attack.

{"text":"Punto Negro \u2013Punto Blanco\u00a9 May 18, 2016 Yes, Trumpet was right Megyn Kelly is a Bimbo According to an online definition a Bimbo is an attractive but empty-headed young woman, especially one perceived as a willing sex object in other words a slut. If you need help with that definition, you need to stop reading and go back to school. So how did I reach the conclusion you may ask? During the Trumpet run for clown president in January, he wrote: Donald J. Trump \u2714\u200e@realDonaldTrump \"@gene70: @FireFlyFury @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump And this is the bimbo that's asking presidential questions?pic.twitter.com\/oU1uUGnuWb\" 3:36 AM - 28 Jan 2016 Now let's get this straight he called a whore, a slut or as we in the HI Spanic, community would say a puta. (See google on line). I don't know if the woman is married, but if somebody called my wife a bimbo and retweeted it 423 times, he would be looking up from the floor. Being nonviolent a person as I am that is, I am just saying. Women all over America were upset by this degrading term on national media. It is a term that is unacceptable in the workplace and could get an employee fired for using it at work. I know I taught Sexual Harassment classes to over ten thousand public employees. The term is right up there with skank. Men and women alike applauded Kelly for her firm stand against Trump and she was to moderate more of the Fascist News Network debates. Then Trumpet announced that if she was moderating he would not attend. Fox concerned about its ratings and the loss of revenue sat Kelly down and told her to fix this. (See bimbo above network.) She and Trumpet had a one hour private meeting. Want to guess what he told her in that meeting? Note it was her responsibility as the victim to show that it was ok. How did that happen, in case you missed it Kelly did a one on one televised interview, (no pun intended) with Trumpet? The Guardian reported \"He also sought to downplay his embrace of the phrase \"bimbo\" to describe Kelly, suggesting at first that he didn't recall doing so. When Kelly pointed out Trump had on several occasions retweeted followers insulting her as such, he responded: \"Ooo. OK. Did I say that? Excuse me.\" He added: \"Over your life, Megyn, you've been called a lot worse. It's a modern form of fighting back.\" Kelly said that it was not about her but rather about the message sent to young girls, to which Trump only offered that he would no longer go after her \"because I think I like our relationship right now\". In other words now that you are being a good Fox bimbo and will do what you are told I can talk to you. Note he never said I am sorry, I apologize for calling you a slut. He just said \"Oh did I say that?\" If that was the apology in my world, he would be looking up from the floor. (I am just saying.) Men like him would never work in California state government or private industry unless someone liked paying millions of dollars in court costs and damages. In California, the status of women in the workplace is not the ultimate best but it is getting better. Kelly has proved that she is no model for working women. She is the worst example to our young women who strive to succeed as professionals. Trumpet is a racist sexist thug that is the bottom line. What is to be done? First, Americans have to decide if having a Thug in the white house is a good thing or a bad thing. If they don't care and most of the replicants with few exception are lining up to jump over the cliff. Moreover, republicant voters who vote will vote 95% for the Trumpet that is the hard statiscal fact, simply because they hate the Clintons. Second, the Clintons have to get off their respective culos and start physically campaigning in Latino neighborhoods and spend 50 million dollars on Latino vote by mail and gotv campaigns. Hillary needs real Latino professionals working her campaign. Hillary should also apologize to the women and men of America for Megan Kelly and her lack moral fiber. Then America could take her seriously. She will then be the nominee of the thinking people of America.

{"text":"Looks like another Washington establishment figure is ready to rally around Trump! It makes perfect sense - Boehner's obstruction of progress and inability to rein in the most extreme voices in his party laid the groundwork for the GOP's natural frontrunner and his \"texting buddy,\" Donald Trump. Former Speaker Boehner Calls Cruz 'Lucifer in the Flesh' NBC NEWS \/\/ CARRIE DANN John Boehner is not a big fan of Ted Cruz. So much so, in fact, that the former Republican House Speaker told an audience at Stanford University Wednesday that the Texas senator is \"Lucifer in the flesh\" and a \"miserable son of a bitch.\" Asked about the 2016 presidential candidate at a forum hosted by Stanford in Government (SIG) and the Stanford Speakers Bureau, Boehner drew laughter for making a face of disgust, according to the Stanford Daily. \"Lucifer in the flesh,\" Boehner said, according to the paper. \"I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.\" He added that he would vote for Donald Trump in a general election if he becomes the Republican nominee but that he would not vote for Cruz. Boehner was reportedly urged by the event's moderator, Professor David M. Kennedy, to be frank because the event was not being broadcast. The former Ohio lawmaker had kinder words for his \"texting buddy\" Donald Trump, with whom Boehner has played golf with for \"years.\" And he described another 2016 candidate, John Kasich, as a \"friend\" too, although he suggested that the relationship takes \"more effort\" than others. \"[Kasich] requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends ... but he's still my friend, and I love him,\" Boehner said. Cruz famously led a group of hard-line conservatives who derailed House leaders' attempts to avoid a government shutdown in 2013. Cruz's failed attempt to force the defunding of President Barack Obama's signature health care law resulted in a 16-day shutdown that was widely seen as politically damaging for the Republican Party. Boehner stepped down from his role as House Speaker last September under political pressure from conservatives on Capitol Hill. NBC News has reached out to Cruz's team for comment.

{"text":"Hi Ed - thanks for trying to fit something in quick for the NRC group. I'm not sure about Richard's full motives, but I think he has his heart in the right place - that the NRC Committee might have gotten the impression he did, and this will be reflected in their report, perhaps in a way that is even less satisfactory to you and Keith. And, this report will likely have enormous political potential. It needs to get things as right as possible from the start. So... time well spent on the part of you and Keith. Thanks much, peck Hi Peck, Being in Bangkok, on to PACLIM, on to CONCORD in Mendoza, back to Bangkok, and back to NY on May 1 makes it difficult for me to do much, but I will do what I can to salvage a bad situation. The longish emails I sent out to you all contain much of what I would write. The main point to make, one that Richard seems to be totally oblivious to, is that there is no evidence for loss of sensitivity prior to the 20th century in a large-scale NH sense like that seen in the 20th century. On the other hand, there is evidence that there was not a loss of sensitivity in a large-scale NH sense in my QSR paper (Fig. 6). I acknowledge the weakness in the data prior to about 1200, but even so the regional comparisons only show divergence between north and south in the 20th century, with none indicated during the putative MWP. So why is Richard and the NRC panel apparently stating without evidence that divergence probably is a problem in the past and, therefore, tree rings cannot be trusted to reconstruct past temperatures? It is honestly unscientific when the only evidence that I have seen refutes that premise, and it plays unfairly into McIntyre's hand. I almost admit to being very irritated that Richard should anoint himself as the arbitrator of this debate. He knows nothing substantive about tree rings. In that sense, he is just like Ray Bradley. Cheers, Ed On Mar 14, 2006, at 6:29 AM, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: Hi Ed and Keith - I hate to say it, but Richard's take on the political aspects of the NRC vs. IPCC reports seem worth some extra effort. Since you were both invited to speak with the NRC committee, I would suggest that you both (together or separately) submit formal comments asap. I don't know when the comment period starts or ends, but I'm guessing you have to work fast. I'm also thinking that you two might want to get out a peer-reviewed paper on the topic really soon too. I worry that the hole will continue to deepen for dendroclimate if you two don't act to clarify what we know\/don't know, and when it is safe (and why) to use dendroclimate data to address the issue of long-term variation in temperature. Please don't construe my suggestions or comments as pro\/con dendro, but rather just as someone who wants the truth - whatever it is - to be communicated clearly, and as best we know it. But, I do think that if Richard is suspect, dendro has a real problem. He doesn't have a personal bias in this, and is clearly trying harder than most to understand what's really going on with climate and the proxies. Effort now might save time later. Also, are you both going to be at the Swiss mtg in June? We really have to get this all ironed out better before the next (last) draft of the IPCC AR4. Thanks, Peck -- Jonathan T.

Have seen you're RC bet. Not entirely sure this is the right way to go, but it will drum up some discussion. Anyway Mike and Caspar have seen me present possible problems with the SST data (in the 1940s\/50s and since about 2000). The first of these will appear in Nature on May 29. There should be a News and Views item with this article by Dick Reynolds. The paper concludes by pointing out that SSTs now (or since about 2000, when the effect gets larger) are likely too low. This likely won't get corrected quickly as it really needs more overlap to increase confidence. Bottom line for me is that it appears SSTs now are about 0.1 deg C too cool globally. Issue is that the preponderance of drifters now (which measure SST better but between 0.1 and 0.2 lower than ships) mean anomalies are low relative to the ship-based 1961-90 base. This also means that the SST base the German modellers used in their runs was likely too warm by a similar amount. This applies to all modellers, reanalyses etc. There will be a lot of discussion of the global T series with people saying we can't even measure it properly now. The 1940s\/50s problem with SSTs (the May 29 paper) also means there will be warmer SSTs for about 10 years. This will move the post-40s cooling to a little later - more in line with higher sulphate aerosol loading in the late 50s and 1960s70s. The paper doesn't provide a correction. This will come, but will include the addition of loads more British SSTs for WW2, which may very slightly cool the WW2 years. More British SST data have also been digitized for the late 1940s. Budget constraints mean that only about half the RN log books have been digitized. Emphasis has been given to the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean log books. As an aside, it is unfortunate that there are few in the Pacific. They have digitized all the logbooks of the ships journeys from the Indian Ocean south of Australia and NZ to Seattle for refits. Nice bit of history here - it turns out that most of the ships are US ones the UK got under the Churchill\/Roosevelt deal in early 1940. All the RN bases in South Africa, India and Australia didn't have parts for these ships for a few years. So the German group would be stupid to take your bet. There is a likely ongoing negative volcanic event in the offing! 2. You can delete this attachment if you want. Keep this quiet also, but this is the person who is putting in FOI requests for all emails Keith and Tim have written and received re Ch 6 of AR4. We think we've found a way around this. I can't wait for the Wengen review to come out with the Appendix showing what that 1990 IPCC Figure was really based on. The Garnaut review appears to be an Australian version of the Stern Report.

Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people navigate familiar terrain visually. In other words, it is not intended as a wannabe spy satellite. Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model of the earth's surface. When a particular region in question is covered in a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the earth's surface. The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data. Got it? -James Rogers jamesr@best.com","label":0}

It is first recorded as being used by Captain > Frederick Marryat in \/Jacob Faithful\/ in 1835: \"I won't thrash you Tom. > Shiver my timbers if I do\". It seems implausible to me that \"shiver\" here means \"to shake\"; I don't recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913 lists that sense as \"v. i.\", or intransitive. The transitive sense of \"shiver\", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the 1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means \"to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow\". Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat. (Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough, leaves you with a sinking boat.) So, \"Shiver my timbers if I do,\" can be reasonably interpreted as a more vivid way of saying, \"May I die suddenly if I do.\" The interpretation suggested by Quinion, \"May my boat be damaged,\" neither makes as much sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.

{"text":"Gaggle Part 1 , Part 2 From: \"Bennett, Eric\" > Date: Monday, April 25, 2016 at 11:49 AM To: Comm_D > Subject: RE: Video Request: Cruz in Borden, IN Even if he dresses like Hillary Clinton, Donald still can't use the bathroom with little girls.<--- he's used this line a couple of times. It's coupled with his criticism of Trump's stance on the NC anti-LGBT bill Donald Trump is not shy about telling people how big, strong and tough he is. If he's so tough, he needs to stop hiding in Trump towers and answer the questions that voters have. -- This election will come down to jobs, freedom and security. Cruz: lift the boot of the necks of small business. Cruz: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. We will pass health insurance that's personal, portable and affordable. We will pass a simple flat tax so that every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. After we do that, we should abolish the IRS. Cruz: we're going to rein in the EPA, federal agencies that have descended like locusts killing jobs all across the country. We're going stop amnesty, secure the border. We're going to end sanctuary cities, welfare benefits for those here illegally. Goes on to say that will bring back manufacturing jobs from China and Mexico. We're going to see manufacturing jobs coming back Next important thing at stake is freedom. Says two branches hang in the balance in this election. Goes on to talk about different rights at stake if another liberal Supreme Court justice is appointed. Guns rights, religious liberty and sovereignty. Hits Trump for suggesting he would compromise religious liberty and second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Adds that he's been supporting left wing Democratic politicians for 40 years. Cruz: I give you my solemn commitment that every justice I appoint will be a principled constitutionalist that will protect the Bill of Rights. I will not compromise your religious liberty or right to keep and bear arms. Cruz hits Trump for saying he would be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. Adds that he will stand unapologetically with Israel. Talks about how readiness and morale in the military has plummeted. Goes on to talk about how he will rebuild the military by repealing Obamacare, adopting a flat tax and stopping amnesty. Cruz: no longer will our military be governed by political correctness. Criticizes President Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism. Cruz: We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. To the jihadist, your day of reckoning is coming. To ISIS: we're not coming to negotiate with you or read you your rights; we're coming to kill you. Speaks out against the rules of engagement that he says is tying the hands of our military men and women. Cruz: If military force is needed we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and get the heck out. We started with 17 candidates, young dynamic candidates. Democratic field consist of a wild-eyed socialist with views that are dangerous for America and the world and Bernie Sanders. Cruz: We're seeing Republicans coming together and uniting behind this campaign. 60-75% of Republicans recognize that nominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck. Touts the fact that 5 of 17 presidential candidates have endorsed his campaign. Hits Trump for not wanting to debate. Closes by asking for support From: Bennett, Eric Sent: Monday, April 25, 2016 11:18 AM To: Comm_D Subject: RE: Video Request: Cruz in Borden, IN Gaggle Hits Trump for not wanting to debate and not having solutions to the issues. Cruz: we're all in on Indiana. Indiana is a crossroad. It's big news that John Kasich has decided to pull out of Indiana, giving us the opportunity to go head-to-head with Trump. We made the decision about allocating resources. We're at a fork in the road. If Trump is the nominee, Hillary wins by double digits. We lose the Senate and the Supreme Court. Trump losing would also cost seats in the state of Indiana. If Donald Trump is the nominee, Hillary wins and she will bankrupt the coal industry. Cruz: we had both conversations and both campaigns agreed. We're focused on Indiana and Kasich is focused elsewhere. On whether it's desperation, Cruz says he doesn't doubt that Donald will scream, yell and curse. People got excited because Trump won his home state. Touts his victories in previous contests. On whether it's a hail mary, Cruz says it's abundantly clear that we're headed to a contested convention. Calls Trump a minority and fringe candidate. Adds that Republicans are uniting behind his campaign. Cruz: we need a president in the spirit of Mitch Daniels and Mike Pence. Cruz: From day one, I've been an outsider. The voters can ask who has stood up and led the fight against the Washington cartel. Hits Trump for funding the gang of eight while he was fighting against it. On whether he's colluding with Kasich, Cruz says Trump is a sore loser. Says his response is to attack the voters. Notes how Trump would rather hide in Trump towers and stay in the NE states that tend to be more liberal. The entire Trump campaign is run by the Washington lobbyist. Again hits Trump for not showing up to debate. \"This is a fraud\" Cruz says when he describes Trump openly stating that he's not going to do what he says he's going to do. Notes how it would be a disaster to nominate Donald Trump. Highlights Trump's comment of wanting to punish women for having an abortion.

{"text":"Great idea Luis can you check Sent from my iPhone On May 5, 2016, at 1:31 PM, Dillon, Lauren > wrote: If they are looking anything on topics specific to labor or education, we can work on those as well. From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Thursday, May 05, 2016 11:38 AM To: Dacey, Amy; Dillon, Lauren Subject: RE: Trump Yes. We shared the below with state parties yesterday and will send to John. Dangerous Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing in the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is dangerous, and he lacks the judgment or temperament to be president. His impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. And just like Republicans in Washington have done for years, Dangerous Donald is only looking out for himself. His plans would benefit those at the very top and would drag our country back to where we were when the last Republican president left office losing 800,000 jobs a month. The American people can't afford to let him bully his way into the Oval Office. Dangerous Donald Trump has already damaged America's relationships across the globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign, at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. And his business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the American people can't afford to let him get anywhere near the White House. National Security: Even as a candidate, Dangerous Donald has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably make America less safe. \u00b7 Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and in his own words, on his \"good brain.\" \u00b7 Trump has falsely claimed that he knows \"more about ISIS than the generals\" and recommended that the U.S. military commit international war crimes. \u00b7 Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances like NATO, pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictators would put our country on a dangerous path. \u00b7 Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European territory, and wants to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disarmament. Wrong on Women: Dangerous Donald has a decades-long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career. \u00b7 Trump once said you had to treat women \"like s**t\" and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names \u2013 \"fat pig,\" \"slob,\" or \"bimbo\" \u2013 and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be \"griping and bitching.\" \u00b7 Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished \u2013 but not the doctors that performed them \u2013 and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion. \u00b7 Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to \"the marketplace\" and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business.\" Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him \"100 percent.\" Divisive and Dangerous: Dangerous Donald exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the pursuit of getting elected \u2013 to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media. \u00b7 Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and called to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all Muslims in America \u2013 including U.S. citizens \u2013 and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi Germany. \u00b7 Trump called Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and criminals and said they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Native Americans were \"real Indians,\" and claimed that a \"well-educated black has a tremendous advantage\" \u2013 but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organization was sued for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans. \u00b7 Trump has been endorsed by former KKK leader David Duke, and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and the KKK four times in one interview. \u00b7 Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, suggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe \"should have been roughed up,\" promising to pay the legal fees if someone would \"knock the hell\" out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be \"carried off on a stretcher.\" \u00b7 Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to \"open up\" libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies, and thought \"closing\" parts of the Internet was a rational strategy to combat ISIS. Bad at Business, Bad for the Economy: Though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman, Dangerous Donald's real life record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expense of everyday Americans. \u00b7 Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American jobs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against, like China and Mexico. \u00b7 Dangerous Donald owes everything to the tens of millions of dollars in loans and bailouts he received from his family. \u00b7 Dangerous Donald's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his disastrous business decisions. \u00b7 During one of his business bankruptcies, his personal finances were at the mercy of banks who put him on an \"allowance\" of $400,000 per month. \u00b7 His Trump \"University\" fleeced thousands of Americans simply looking to get ahead. \u00b7 Trump's unfounded predictions of recession under President Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless. \u00b7 Economists have actually predicted Trump's policies could start an international trade war and even destabilize the global economy . \u00b7 Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while costing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Republican plan proposed. It also violates his pledge not to increase the national debt. \u00b7 Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party's debates that \"wages are too high\" and opposed raising the minimum wage \u00b7 Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million Americans who've been able to get coverage under Obamacare. Republicans couldn't unite against him and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until November 8th.

{"text":"Lone Wolf Fliering Tips By Hardy Lloyd Found at www.fascistworld.org There are two types of people who flier One who wastes his time with an organization. Who wastes his energies and money on fliers that contain boring facts and scientific figures that the brain dead could care less about! Someone who pays $0.10 per page for a sheet long flier, instead of printing up sheets with 3, 5, even 12 mini-fliers! Then there is the other type. The guy who joins no organization. A man who is willing to dress as the brain dead or even as a JEW in order to get away with putting up fliers! A man who prints up fliers that can be cut 3, 5, even 12 mini-fliers per page, thus saving him money that can be used to create bombs and zip guns! This type of Lone Wolf propagandist uses neither facts nor scientific evidence to convince a brain dead people to \\93join\\94 a \\93legal\\94 organization whose goals are laughable ! No, this Lone Wolf pamphleteer uses EMOTIONAL WORDS AND PHRASES! He creates fliers that speak to a White's emotions! He uses words that anger people, that put fear into people He even lies and exaggerates in order to sway the public to act in a violent manor!! This Lone Wolf doesn 't care about \\93saving his country\\94 or in \\93preserving law and order\\94 NO! He only cares about stirring up violence and terrorism, because he knows that the White man is an emotional creature who must be pushed and forced into saving his race from slavery! Fliering should be done to stir the pot, to create a storm of violence against our enemies Fliering should never, EVER, be done to recruit people to our cause. Why? Because Aryans are born, they are not recruited! If you live in this world and yet need to be convinced that White Racial Loyalty and violence are true, then who needs you!! FUCK OFF!! Now for some flier ideas Remember that you should write up fliers with slogans that use emotion and that can be fitted at least 3 per sheet One can always use MSWord 's \\93column\\94 tables to make 8, 10, even 12 per sheet. Tell people in your flier how to make silencers. How to make Napalm. There are 2 ways I know!! How to make a pipe-bomb. Where to use that pipe-bomb. Where to throw that Napalm. How to kill cops and get away with it. How to murder people and get away with it. Hell, promote child sex slavery and drugs! Anything that will cause the people to cry out and revolt! Or, just to piss them off, since they are brain dead, and who needs some one like that!?! Also, you could make up fliers that say things like the following::: Israeli Jews murder 6 million Palestinians every year! Or, niggers rape 2000 White Women every day in the United States ! Or, how about this one: A local detective, Jon Smith, who goes undercover to arrest people, lives at 5551212 USA street . Here is his picture: He needs to die! Terrorism is the poor mans means to achieving FREEDOM! Death to America ! Americans murder 10,000 Mexicans every week! US \\93healthcare\\94 kills 1.7 million Americans every year! OR US \\93healthcare\\94 murders 700,000 Whites every day! And so on Use your imagination, Comrades! Just remember the following. A) 99% of ALL people EVERYWHERE are stupid, especially Americans and Anglo-Saxons!! So, don 't use facts and logic, only use emotional catch words!! B) Don 't join a group! Stay on your own, or with people who you 've known for decades! C) Flier at night, and dress as the locals do when fliering!! Sometimes you can get away with fliering during the day, because people and cops don 't expect you to flier in daylight. Just make sure that you dress as the locals do!! D) Best times to flier at night in the US are Tuesdays, Wodensday, and Thorsday between 1am and 4am Tuesdays from 1am to 3:30am during the hot summer months are best! Most people are too over worked and too tired to care about some \\93homeless\\94 man walking the streets!! E) Dressing as a homeless man is a really good disguise!! No one, and I mean NO ONE, pays ANY attention to a bum on the street!! Make sure to spray yourself with stink smell!! Like deer urine and items found in a hunting store Or just use shit! Trust me, no cop in the world will question you if you seem half asleep and smell of shit!! Uh, also, dressing as a smelling bum is also a good trick when you are trying to assassinate someone!! F) And remember this; you are not trying to recruit people or to even change their minds Your only job is to spread the message of violent revolution and ultra freedom!! And for a quick note concerning debates and arguments with the non WRL white Don 't even try! They are all scum and useless!! Who needs or even wants some schmuck who has to be convinced that we are telling the truth!?! I just tell people this::: \\93Look, pal, I believe in Wotanist Jihad and in killing Americans and infidels. I don 't care what you think, or what you think of me. And yes, I do support socialism and open acts of terrorism! I laugh when a white American is raped! I laugh when an earthquake kills a million American infidels! What ya going to do about it, ah, Whitey!?! You ain 't nothing but a pussy American bitch! I 'll take your ass and rape you with my superior White Cock!! Now get the fuck out of my face, bitch boy!\\94 Have fun, Comrades, and take care!","label":0}

The co-chairs of all of the committees and the At-Large members were elected by the DNC Executive Committee members in January 2016.

{"text":"Washington, D.C. - Today the New York Times' Editorial Board delivered a forceful and important endorsement of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's executive action restoring the voting rights of former convicted felons who have paid their dues to society. Reaffirming the Democratic Party's commitment to protecting the right to vote, the DNC's Vice Chair of Voter Registration and Participation, Donna Brazile, also applauded Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's actions today. Below is her statement, followed by a link and the text of the New York Times' editorial: Statement by DNC Vice Chair of Voter Registration and Participation Donna Brazile: \"The Democratic Party applauds Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's decision to restore the voting rights of over 200,000 citizens. Terry and I first started working on voting rights together when he was the DNC Chair, and he helped established the Voting Rights Institute. Democrats across the nation believe the right to vote is our most fundamental right - it is the right that protects and preserves all of our other rights and freedoms. Democrats also know that we solve our nation's problems with more democracy, not less. \"The contrast between our two national parties has never been more stark than on the issue of our democracy. Sadly, restricting access to the ballot box has become the political strategy for the Republican Party. We have witnessed Republican-led legislatures in Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin and elsewhere make it harder to vote by eliminating same-day registration, reducing early voting, eliminating polling locations, and imposing strict Photo ID laws. Democrats, however, are actively fighting to the expanding expand voter access in states like Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Vermont and everywhere in between. We are fighting in state houses to pass automatic registration, implement online voter registration, expand early voting and same-day registration. Democrats in Congress are working to restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act. \"When long lines form or citizens are unable to overcome election burdens, Republicans blame the problem on 'too many voters' and celebrate those burdens as a key to their general election victory. Meanwhile, New York Democrats are holding people accountable and actively seeking answers. Because Republicans don't hold themselves accountable for election failures, the Democratic National Committee and its partners are doing so for them by filing suit in Arizona to reverse the culture of discrimination and disenfranchisement. \"Today's action is a reminder that elections matter. Our nation and our democracy are stronger and healthier when we elect Democrats up and down the ticket.\" New York Times Editorial: A State Bucks the Trend on Voting Rights NEW YORK TIMES \/\/ EDITORIAL BOARD In a major executive order, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia on Friday restored voting rights to more than 200,000 people who have completed their sentences for felony convictions. Virginia was one of four states, along with Iowa, Kentucky and Florida, that placed a lifetime bar on voting for anyone convicted of a felony. All other states except Maine and Vermont impose lesser restrictions on voting by people with felony convictions. To people who have served their time and finished parole, Mr. McAuliffe said in a statement: \"I want you back in society. I want you feeling good about yourself. I want you voting, getting a job, paying taxes.\" It is the largest restoration of voting rights by a governor, ever. Felon disenfranchisement laws, which currently block nearly six million Americans from voting, were enacted during the Reconstruction era in a racist effort to make it harder for newly freed African-Americans to vote - a reality Mr. McAuliffe acknowledged on Friday. \"There's no question that we've had a horrible history in voting rights as relates to African-Americans - we should remedy it,\" he said. In Virginia, one in five blacks have until now been unable to vote because of a felony conviction. Mr. McAuliffe's historic act, which he took in the face of opposition by the state's Republican-led General Assembly, is all the more notable against the backdrop of persistent attempts by conservative lawmakers and officials around the country to make voting harder or impossible for minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic. (A similar executive order issued last year by Steven Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, was quickly reversed by his successor, Matt Bevin, a Republican.) Until 2013, it was much easier to block discriminatory voting laws. Under the Voting Rights Act, all or parts of 16 states, most in the South, with a history of passing such laws were required to get permission from the Justice Department before making any voting changes. But in the case of Shelby County v. Holder , five Supreme Court justices disabled that requirement, known as preclearance. Now that federal oversight is gone, officials in previously monitored jurisdictions have rushed to impose a slew of new voting laws and regulations, according to a running tally by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. These changes have, among other things, moved or closed polling places, shortened or canceled early-voting periods, required proof of citizenship or a photo identification to register to vote, erroneously purged voters from the rolls and gerrymandered districts to dilute the power of minority voters. When the preclearance requirement, known as Section 5, was in place, changes like these were routinely blocked for being racially discriminatory. Without the requirement, it is impossible to know how many changes are being enacted or attempted, because most happen at the local level and are not broadly reported. It is unlikely that there would be fewer changes than in the decade before the Shelby County ruling, when the Justice Department each year received between 4,500 and 5,500 submissions, and reviewed between 14,000 and 20,000 voting changes. While the vast majority were approved, the federal government blocked more than 700 between 1982 and 2006, when the law was last reauthorized by Congress. Now, in the absence of a strong pre-emptive tool like Section 5, the only meaningful remedy to a discriminatory voting change is litigation, an expensive and time-consuming process that often comes too late to help voters who were harmed by new discriminatory laws. Discrimination in voting, of course, is not limited to the previously covered states. Lawmakers in Ohio and Wisconsin , for example, have gone to great lengths to complicate voting for minorities in those states by, among other things, enacting voter-ID laws or reducing early-voting periods. Since the 2012 presidential election, 17 states have enacted new restrictions on voting, many of which burden minority voters more heavily, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Congress should amend the Voting Rights Act to restore preclearance and apply it to all jurisdictions with a recent history of discriminatory voting practices. And state officials who are not busy trying to disenfranchise people should be following Mr. McAuliffe's example, and working to make it easier for people to vote.

Well, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of shady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had no problems with great performance. Robert Harley worte: >Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows. >They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a >service pack. Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to >run C programs. Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a \"Bad\" programming language or application platform? You don't think this has anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you? Or that MS has basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#? Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the right way to go for most high level applications? Reza B'Far wrote: >2.

You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak? I am not the best C\/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management, however occasional they may be. >It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff... Robert Harley wrote: >If your problem just requires application of a \"design pattern\" to solve, >then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language. Wow! So you're telling me that unless the application involves bit-counting, it's trivial? What about the application itself? What about high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.? Aren't most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns? Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C\/C++ code? For example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment? >I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low >level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over >and over again... Robert Harley wrote: >You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time >on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't. Depends >entirely on the programmer, not the language. I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers. In those cases, it's always very hard to get the programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc. With Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database (JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS). >3.

Robert Harley wrote: >Unsupported assertion. So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C\/C++ for everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff). Is there a standard way of dealing with C\/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging, database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java? I'd like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes C\/C++... In that case, I claim ignorance... Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C\/C++ is overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no flame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious discussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every \"Kid\" can write a well designed Java program. Kids typically don't understand various design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C\/C++ than in Java due to existence of standard API's.","label":0}

When I first joined the NSM I knew it would be something I would stick with the rest of my life. It was not a club, a gang, or some fleeting thrill for the moment: it was a commitment to a way of life, and a direct link to many of our Forefathers who fought for Blood and Soil. Fellow Party members, most of you have taken the Oath of Loyalty to the Party, and those that have not yet taken your Oath, as read in the membership handbook, are expected to do so as soon as possible. It is a commitment, and proves you are serious about helping us to bring about changes in our Nation. It also creates Solidarity, and Kinship with your fellow Brothers and Sisters in our struggle. In this modern day materialistic Society to some an Oath, or pledge of Loyalty means nothing. For those of us that live by the Old Ways, breaking an Oath defiles your Honor, and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that once held your life force. If a man cannot stay true to his Oath, then he is no man but rather a castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an Aryan Soul. Your Oath also holds you to the battlefield, until this fight for our Race and Nation has been won. Members of the SS swear Loyalty to the F\\FChrer I often reflect about so-called Comrades that have abandoned their Oaths to the Party, and I wonder how they can live with themselves, as the rest of us face such a large scale enemy in Zog, and they give up without a fight, or before the fight is finished. We at Party HQ always hear a multitude of excuses from the Oath breakers. Sometimes their reasons are based in serious issues (still there is no reason serious enough to break your Oath) but more often than not it is trivial matters, such as personal problems with another member, so and so had their feelings hurt, or this or that person was not thanked enough for their work, or did not get promoted, or did not like a certain rule in the chain of command, or Religion, or insert excuse here ____. These same Oath breakers often claim to take great pride in the 3rd Reich, and CLAIM they are National Socialists. Truth be known, had they lived during the 3rd Reich and broke their Party Oaths there, especially in the war years, they might have met the hanging Judge Roland Freisler, and be dangling from piano wire! It comes down to this Comrades, and prospective Party members. If you are not serious about our Party leave now. I am opening the door now for any current member to leave, with their Oath intact. I want to shake out any of the uncommitted, non-serious members right now, considering they are not needed as we move forward to the frontlines. To the Prospects and Probate NSM members, this message is for you also. If you are not in this fight with us to the bitter end, now would be the time to walk away. Furthermore, the NSM does not operate as a Democracy: your pledge of Loyalty is to the Party and its Leadership. Honor your Oath, and your Pledge of Loyalty to the Party, or get out of our Ranks now while you still can! To the rest of you, the Party Faithful, the Warrior Archetypes, you men and women forged in Iron and steel ready to stand against the Zionist hordes, and their beloved illegal slave laborers: Your Party Salutes and Honors you! Providence has already promised us Victory in our fight, and your Ancestors march alongside you. In spirit, the men who fought at Valley Forge stand alongside of us, as do the brave men of the Alamo, as do the thousands that perished on the Eastern Front fighting Communism, and every other meaningful battle where our Racial Kinfolk have sacrificed their lives. Let those who abandon us, and break their Oaths, run away quickly with their tails between their legs. If they can live with that shame and dishonor, so be it. For the rest of us, Duty calls! Commander Jeff Schoep National Socialist Movement A message from Director of the Media dept. of NSM 88! To all National Socialist Movement membership. Over the last several weeks we have heard from the Commander regarding the subjects of honor, duty, our oaths, and the proper behavior of a Comrade. We are a National Socialist organization, not a democracy, nor a social club, not a collection of individuals, but a united force for our volk. A NS organization is run on the Fuhrerprizip, a concept brought to us from our ancestors--trust and obedience to your superiors, responsibly and service to those in your command. For too long some amongst us have forgotten that no one individual is important, as our Fuhrer instructs, but that we are all in service to our volk. I personally, and on behalf of my state of Wisconsin, support all decisions of our Commander, who acts to unify us all in service to the movement that is the only hope for our people. We have been through hard times before my Comrades, and will again many times before all is said and done. From experience, we know that the mud slinging will be fast and furious, pay no mind. Accept information only from true sources, the rest is garbage. I am proud to be among you all, and to call you my brothers and sisters! M Sgt Johnson Wisconsin State LeaderDirector of NSM Media NSM\/ MO. Statement: I have been asked to make a statement on behalf of NSM Missouri, although it is ridiculous that I anyone should have to say anything at all. Let me state unequivocally that the entire state of Missouri is behind the Commander 100%. Jeff Schoep has been a good friend as well as leader for a long time. The NSM is growing exponentially as is the state of Missouri. Much, if not all of that, is due to his leadership. Commander Schoep is exactly right - this is not a democracy. We are National Socialists. We recognise the Fuhrerprinzip. Fall in line or get out! I feel stupid even making this statement as only four people have left the party. Three of them were expelled and the fourth was the best friend and assistant of one of the expelled members! This kind of thing has gone on forever. Every political party does this (look at the republicrats). It happened in the NSDAP. It happened in the ANP. It is not unusual, strange, or unheard of. But one thing is certainly true: it is long overdue that we should put our petty individual egos\/disagreements\/problems aside and get on with the epic, monumental, historic, and absolutely mandatory task of saving our Race. Heil Hitler! MSgt. Steven Boswell NSM Missouri A number of other NSM Leaders have also issued similar statements, however this is more than enough to put this issue in its casket. --------------------------------- Date: Sun, 21 Oct 2007 12:52:23 -0700 From: zogsnightmare@yahoo.com Subject: What really happened to Nukeisrael and Jim Ramm?

I designed a massive website that received 3000-5000 views daily, The Zog's Nightmare videogames, shot and edited dozens of video's, sponsored 6 events and rallies in the Northwest, made 74 radio shows and spent thousands on the cause of National Socialism. Now I have been discarded and treated like a jew by the same organization I have spent nearly every spare second working for. Many people have heard rumors...But few know what really happened. Jeff Schoep and his internet-bullyboy John Schafer have been working overtime to silence me. It will not work, the truth will be told... Here is how I went from being one of Jeff Schoep's closet personal advisors to one of his many enemies rivaling that of Bill White: It all started when a young woman I had a short term-relationship with wanted to do some volunteer work to help out the party. First remember, when Jeff or anyone say \"the party\" they really mean \"our business\" which is NSM records. in 2006 NSM records did over $110,000 in sales, and the rumor is that the current projections for this year are around $180,000.. NSM records is a business that doesn't report total profits to the members so nobody knows just how much is going in and what it's being spent on. Not even colonel bishop knows the final numbers, only Jeff and John. NSM members are expected to just smile and just hope Commander is spending the money wisely. Anyway, this young woman contacted the guy the who runs the forums to get involved. John Schafer (AKA REICHSMARSHAL). Johnny is the server administrator for new Saxon, NSM Forum and nsm88records is also co-owner of A business and he doesn't want this fact advertised. John is a net nazi whom has never been to any NSM rally or gathering. John was informed that this woman was involved with Jim Ramm but he still tried desperately to put the moves on her. John did his best attempting to brainwash her against me and her friends but It didn't work. When I found out about the acts of severe dishonor I informed Commander Schoep. Schoep phoned her and investigated, he later told other members in the party that the dishonor never happened and the woman said it was a mistake. Schoep lied for John and it wasn't the first time, but why would he do this? John is a talented but lonely hacker-geek who has nearly godlike abilities on the internet. Egomaniac John Schafer has a fiber-optic connection into his house at 38 Wilson Dr, Berkeley Heights, NJ 07922. At that location he has the servers that run new saxon, NSM 88 Records and the Main NSM site. John's business is called Sch\\E4fer Gerig & Associates (SG&A) and he rumors to have some non-white clients. Phone: (973) 698-7542, Home Phone (908) 464-0920. at this point I decided to take a leave of absence from the NSM and get out quietly while causing the least amount of harm to the party. I redesigned nukeisrael and removed all links to the NSM. However Schoep was very angry. He directed Schafer to hack into the account where nukeisrael was located and change the registration, password, username and redirect the site to the nsm88records money-machine. They then made up some lie about how I was encouraging genocide to use as justification for the outright theft of nukeisrael which has always been my site. Unfortunately, the domain name was registered in Canada which makes it extremely unlikely that the Canadian government will pressure the US government to extradite John Schafer for breaking Canadian law. Nukeisrael was once estimated to bring in at a domain name auction between $2200-$3000. This site was never donated to the NSM, it was always registered in my name until Schafer stole it and transferred everything. This isn't the first domain name Schafer ever stole. After the Eric Adams scandal (Eric was accused of theft by Schoep who provided no evidence) John Schafer hacked into and stole outright 6 domains that Eric had owned. His skills for evil on a computer cannot be overestimated, Schafer is very good at the crimes he commits. Refusing to be treated like a nigger, Jim Ramm fought back. I converted Bill WhiteWatch into NSM watch and begin to tell the truth about what had happened. Unfortunately I underestimated Schafer's abilities and he also broke into the blogger account probally using a password guessing program. The blog site is now a NSM propaganda site. He even broke into my yahoo email addresss and stole that also thinking he would completely silence me from telling the truth about the crooks in the NSM. It didn't work and I am now openly speaking out against the NSM backstabbers whom will gladly screw their own white brother for a buck. Over a hundred NSM members have now quit over this scandal and others that popped up about the same time. Nick Chapell resigned and with him went the NSM meeting Hall in Laurens S.C. Presidential Candidate Taylor Bowles has resigned and many more people too numerous to mention. The NSM is truly imploding. and Nick and Taylor have starting a new organization called the National Socialist Order of America that I urge all current and former NSM members to join. website: If that site ever gets hacked we will all know who did it! NSM members make no mistake: Jeff Schoep is in this just for the money and he really doesn't give a damn about the White Race. Devil-Worshiper Chairman Herrington never left the party and is still actively involved. Herrington still owns and controls the National Socialist Movement and uses Jeff Schoep as his proxy. Your donations to the NSM and the NSM 88records profits are going to buy Jeffie toys and pay for the Joy of Satan devil-group that is run by Herrington's mentally-ill wife. I underestimated John Schafer once and that won't happen again. Zog's nightmare will be soon available free online, that will put a damper on videogame sales...Schoep and Schafer might have won a battle, but we are in it for the long haul, and will win the war.

VIDEO \"I do think it is important for us to understand the nature of the threat; what works and what doesn't. Painting the Muslim community with a broad brush does not work. They are the greatest allies in fighting against the organizations...Most importantly, we have to stay true to our values during the process. We have to make sure that we are not engaging in the kind of the knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we have heard from some politicians. We have to make sure that the legal structures around our intelligence gathering and our use of predators are subject to oversight. It is not always going to be easy. It is not always going to be perfectly smooth. There are going to be times where as president you make a decision knowing that there are going to be critics, and knowing that there's some gray areas, and ambiguities that you have to deal with given the realities of the situation, but overall, I think that we can draw a lesson from the Bin Laden raid that we have got really effective people and a government that knows how to do this. As long as we operate from the position of confidence and strength and are true to who we are, groups like this or the individuals like this cannot defeat us.\" President Obama is correct. Success in combating terror requires strong relationships with our Muslim allies in the Middle East and Muslims in the United States who are often the first line of defense against terror attacks. In fact, taking out Osama Bin Laden depended on those relationships with Muslims in Afghanistan and Pakistan who provided intelligence to U.S. officials. The President's comments put Dangerous Donald Trump's lack of judgment in context, including his absurd proposal to ban an entire religion from the United States, along with his and other half-baked proposals and foreign policy cluelessness, has that have alarmed our allies throughout the world - including leaders in the Middle East who are our partners in fighting terror. They're also a reminder that Ted Cruz has been just as disconnected from reality in his calls has called for \"carpet bombing\" the Middle East Syria and Iraq with no regard to civilian lives, and would force law enforcement to \"patrol and secure\" neighborhoods where Muslim-Americans live, a dangerous and discriminatory policy that resembles the political witch hunts of the McCarthy era would only make our communities less safe.

The Trump campaign responded with the following statement: Yesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign's list in February 2016. Reached again by Mother Jones late Tuesday, Johnson said he would resign as a delegate if asked to do so by the campaign. \"I accept Trump's explanation,\" he said, regarding the statement. \"I don't want to gainsay the Trump campaign. If I am not removed from the database, I will resign.\" Although the Trump campaign blamed a \"database error\" for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago. Trump's California delegate coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino, sent Johnson a congratulatory email on Monday, and when he asked for clarification about how to send his completed pledge form back to the campaign, she replied. Here is the email exchange (with the personal contact information redacted by Mother Jones): [ Mother Jones also has a copy of the pledge form discussed in the email exchange, which Johnson signed and sent to the Trump campaign on Monday.

Trump's slate includes William Johnson, one of the country's most prominent white nationalists. Johnson applied to the Trump campaign to be a delegate. He was accepted on Monday. In order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign: \"I, William Johnson, endorse Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States. I pledge to cast ALL of my ballots to elect Donald J. Trump on every round of balloting at the 2016 Republican National Convention so that we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" After he signed, the Trump campaign added his name to the list of 169 delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state. Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that \"exists to represent the political interests of White Americans\" and aims to preserve \"the customs and heritage of the European American people.\" The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is \"arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,\" according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups. Johnson got the news that he had been selected by Trump in a congratulatory email sent to him by the campaign's California Delegate Coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino. \"I just hope to show how I can be mainstream and have these views,\" Johnson tellsMother Jones. \"I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody.\" Johnson says that in his application to be a GOP delegate for Trump he disclosed multiple details about his background and activism, though he did not specifically use the term \"white nationalist.\" The Trump campaign and Lagomarsino did not respond to requests for comment. Whether or not Johnson was vetted by the Trump campaign, the GOP front-runner would have a hard time claiming ignorance of Johnson's extreme views: Johnson has gained notice during the presidential primary for funding pro-Trump robocalls that convey a white nationalist message. \"The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called 'racist,'\" Johnson says in one robocall pushed out to residential landlines in Vermont and Minnesota. \"\u2026Donald Trump is not racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don't vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\" Armed with cash from affluent donors and staffed by what the movement considers to be its top thinkers, the AFP now dedicates most of its resources to supporting Trump\u2014and for good reason: Johnson claims the AFP's pro-Trump robocalls, which have delivered Johnson's personal cellphone number to voters in seven states, have helped the party find hundreds of new members. \"[Trump] is allowing us to talk about things we've not been able to talk about,\" Johnson says. \"So even if he is not elected, he has achieved great things.\" On numerous occasions, Trump has failed to forcefully repudiate this sort of support. After being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in August last year, Trump simply told Bloomberg News, \"I don't need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn't want his endorsement. I don't need anybody's endorsement.\" Asked in February about the robocalls, which are funded by Johnson through a super-PAC, a Trump spokeswoman would only tell CNN that the candidate had \"disavowed all super-PACs offering their support.\" The SPLC's Potok argues that Trump has \"legitimized and mainstreamed hate\" in ways we haven't seen since the days of George Wallace. Though nobody can say for sure how many people belong to America's largest hate groups, the SPLC has found that the number of such groups grew by 14 percent in 2015, reversing years of declines. Potok worries that Trump could fuel the spread of the AFP's ideas for years to come. Johnson is a corporate lawyer who grows persimmons and raises chickens at his 67-acre \"ranch\" in a Los Angeles suburb. When I met him recently outside his law office in downtown LA's World Trade Center, he was in high spirits. He suggested brightly that we walk downstairs to get lunch at a nearby Korean restaurant. As we sat next to a table of immaculately coiffed Korean Air flight attendants, I mentioned that some might find it surprising that a guy who wrote a book advocating the creation of an all-white ethno-state was eating a plate of bulgogi beef with kimchee. \"Koreans don't have to make Korean food,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"One of the best Chinese restaurants I went to in the Bay Area is owned by a Mormon and cooked by a Mormon. Really great Chinese food.\" Short, graying, and 61 years old, Johnson favors pressed white shirts and bookish black-framed glasses. He grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods in Arizona and Oregon before moving to Japan in 1974 to study the language. It was there that locals engaged him in \"open\" discussions about differences between the races, and he came to see America's European heritage as its biggest\u2014and most vulnerable\u2014asset. (This trajectory is not uncommon: Jared Taylor, head of the white nationalist group American Renaissance, also speaks fluent Japanese, and Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler became a white supremacist while immersed in the caste system in India.) In 1985, Johnson published, under a pseudonym, Amendment to the Constitution: Averting the Decline and Fall of America, a book calling for the abolition of the 14th and 15th Amendments and the deportation of all nonwhites. He tried to sound a practical tone, allowing, for instance, that African Americans should receive \"a rich dowry to enable them to prosper in their homeland.\" The book was a hit on the talk show circuit, and Johnson suddenly found himself appearing on television alongside neo-Nazi skinheads and Klansmen. By 1989, his notoriety and clean-cut appeal convinced a group of white nationalists in Wyoming to tap him to run for Dick Cheney's vacant congressional seat. He garnered a flurry of press coverage when he earned enough signatures to qualify for the ballot; around the same time, the building housing his California law office was bombed. Johnson says the FBI accused him of detonating it himself in a bid for more press. (The bureau declined to comment.) Twenty years later, after unsuccessfully running for various other offices, Johnson became the head of the American Freedom Party (then known as American Third Position), at the request of a group of Southern California skinheads. Johnson's post was supposed to be temporary: \"The skinheads thought I was too extreme to run the organization,\" he explained. But they were the ones who ended up dropping out, replaced by what has become a sort of white nationalist brain trust: Party leaders now include a former Reagan administration appointee and a professor emeritus at California State University-Long Beach. After our Korean lunch, Johnson rushed back up to his office to host the latest episode of For God and Country, a Christian AM talk show currently broadcast in California, Louisiana, and Texas. His Filipino American co-host, the Rev. Ronald Tan, nodded approvingly as Johnson praised Trump on the air for \"busting up the concept of political correctness.\" The show allows Johnson to push a Trump-centric version of white nationalism to a potentially receptive audience\u2014up to a point. Several radio stations in Iowa recently canceled the program out of objection to its content. During a commercial break, Johnson fidgeted. \"Are you going to quote any more Scriptures?\" he asked Tan nervously. \"Has the station said that we're not Christian enough?\" Back on the air, Tan pivoted to 1 Samuel 16, comparing Trump to King David. In addition to promoting Trump on the radio and over the phone, the AFP streams a podcast called the Daily Trump Phenomenon Hour. It has set up a \"political harassment hotline\" for Trump supporters who wish to consult with an attorney about being attacked or verbally abused by anti-Trump protesters. Johnson has personally spent $30,000 the Trump promotions, including $18,000 for the party. The robocalls, the radio show, and the \"harassment hotline\" were all things that Johnson mentioned in his application to become a Trump delegate. He specifically cited an anti-Romney robocall commissioned in Utah this past March, which begins, in part, \"My name is William Johnson. I am a farmer and a white nationalist.\" After wrapping up the radio show, Johnson led me through his office, where a brush-painted screen hangs alongside shelves stacked with Japanese books and dictionaries. Many of his legal clients, it turns out, are foreigners who speak English as a second language. Yet Johnson says he sees no problem with Trump's isolationist foreign policy, even if it hurts his business\u2014ideally, he'd like to give up his practice and serve as Trump's secretary of agriculture. We ended up in a mirrored conference room to meet with three AFP sympathizers, two middle-aged women and a young man. They talked about how Trump had enabled a new kind of \"honest discourse,\" how he wasn't a racist but a \"racialist,\" and how he had left them feeling \"emancipated.\" Johnson also now finds it easier to be himself: \"For many, many years, when I would say these things, other white people would call me names: 'Oh, you're a hatemonger, you're a Nazi, you're like Hitler,'\" he confessed. \"Now they come in and say, 'Oh, you're like Donald Trump.'\"","label":0}

{"text":"Dear NSM Party Comrades, As you all know the Party has been making great strides forward in recent years. We are currently the largest Pro-White group in America, and the only unabashadly, openly NS Party in America. There is no where else, and no other Party here in the U.S. that comes even close to us, but I am sure you already know that. Of course because we are all members of the same team, right? Recently certain Party members have been at each others throats. Some Party members were called into a room before Nationals because of such behavior, now a new set of people are at it again. First, I will list my own faults, I have been too fair, too nice, too easy going, and too lenient hoping it would all come together. Instead it has been a huge burden watching my Brothers and Sisters pick each other apart. One Party Officer has been demoted for conduct unbecoming of an Officer, and anyone, I mean anyone who continue's in any sort of drama that deviates from the mission at hand, will be next. I do not expect any of you to like these orders, or even agree with it, but I do expect your Loyalty and continued service to the Folk. The Party runs on the Fuhrerprinzip, it is not a democracy, and all matters in which we do things are always well calculated for the greater good of the whole Party. Personal likes, dislikes, feuds, conflict, that is all normal. Conflict has existed since the dawn of time. All Comrades need to focus on their own tasks and work, and not worry about others who work in other Depts. I have been thinking about these matters for a few weeks now, and had seriously considered removing certain conflicting members from the Ranks all together. When Col. Bishop and I have to play babysitter, and talk to people about drama, it makes us, all of you, and our Party look foolish. America is being overrun with Mexicans and other invaders, instead of expelling certain people, these members and the Party are better served if the drama is saved for the playground, and we all get back to work. Most of you recieving this will have no idea what I am talking about, good deal, just consider this a shake up then. This directive is a direct order from myself and Col. Bishop. Most of you rarely see me order any of my Comrades to do anything, I work alongside of you, and for you. This directive should be sent to all active Party members, not all of you are in my e-mail address book, so forward to only those members that need to read it. On a positive note, Party projects are going forward and we are growing every single day. We will be announcing the next NSM Public meeting with a week, it will be a good one. Hail Victory!

{"text":"Overview With his lock on the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has ensured that his party's problems won't be limited to convention chaos- he's going to force GOP candidates in races big and small across the country to own his ugly, divisive and dangerous rhetoric all the way to the general election. That's why GOP party leaders have started to fret publicly about their party's deepening divides, and stumble with no real strategy for embracing their standard bearer. You may have missed it, but 2016 is going so badly for the RNC, they put out a second autopsy . Sad! For years, the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns and now they're stuck with Trump. Over the last few weeks, exit polls have confirmed that Republicans believe their primary has been divisive, while three fourths of Democrats are excited about our primaries and would support either of our candidates. This week, Trump showed he has no interest in being forthright with the American people. His refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his false claim that voters would learn nothing from them has set off fresh criticism from all sides . A new DNC video highlights his refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his false claim that voters would learn nothing from them. Trump is simply not being honest with the American people and lacks the temperament to be president. WATCH [tax returns.jpg] Important Polls * According to a poll from Quinnipiac University, in Florida, 51% approved of Obama's nomination of Garland, among Ohio voters, 47% said they approved of Obama's nomination of Garland, and in Pennsylvania, 52% said they viewed Obama's nomination favorably. * According to a poll from Public Policy Polling, 61% of voters view the presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump, unfavorably. What people are writing in the states Donald Trump's meeting with GOP leadership this week showed that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. This week, Democrats around the country have shown that from now until November 8th, we're going to hold Republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their divisive and dangerous policies.

Also, another alternative to the grey and red could be some other color that is just less bright - perhaps blue? Agree there is no reason to switch the reviewed panel c uncertainty approach. It argues a bit that we leave panel a as is too. I'm unsure what is best, so maybe see what Keith thinks too - and discuss more with Phil - he is right that most are trying to go with 5-95 where possible.

Your work on Staff is more important than $10. a month anyways, reliable help is hard to find. Yeah, the ranks are swelling, but solid reliable help is still a precious resource (don't laugh, its true, ha ha). The end of the NSM is retarded as Ramsey himself, that homosexual still calls me every single day and leaves weirdo messages. Perhaps if he found a girlfriend he could stop being so gay. His behavior is like a text book page out of some jewish handbook. No one will think ill of you if you do not have the funds to be at Nationals, I have been there and done that in regards to having nothing and have done the homeless thing in the past too (years ago), so no worrys Brother.

{"text":"20020716 Lockergnome Apple Core 07.16.2002 GnomeREPORT Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. Register for Gnomedex today! Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I start with the basics, for that reason, I'm going to take things step-by-step, following my own learning process and progressing to gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get up to speed. I'm off to the Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this evening just to be sure. With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking lots of photos, as usual. See You in August, Jake Ludington GnomeDOWNLOADS Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids. GnomeNETWORK Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, for small office or home networking of Mac\/PC mixed environments, this is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane. GnomeSCRIPT Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons. Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the information in the description will show up in the start up screen. The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the bottom up. Telling the \"Applications\" folder to tell its \"Jake\" subfolder to tell the application \"Jake's Media Player,\" located in that folder to do something could also be written by telling the script to access \"Jake's Media Player\" located in the \"Jake\" subfolder of the \"Applications folder, The upcoming example will make this a bit more clear.

You're guaranteed to find something entertaining here, and if you need a logo designed, Von Robert Glitschka might even take you on as a client. The portfolio is extensive, including stock images and even some icons by the artist's seven year old daughter. A must read is the anatomy of an illustration section, which lays down artistic opinion, straight from Glitschka's mouth on how to make a funny creation. This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is accessible by everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions. GnomeTIP Traditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.

{"text":"Evening Standard - 28 August 2002 [Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in Antarctica has been found alive in a \"big huddle\". The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: \"The penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a successful breeding season over the winter.\" Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the cape, may have lost up to third of its population. ------------------------ Yahoo!

{"text":"Malcolm sorry , I should have cc'd this message sent to my coauthors some time ago(it pre-dates the message to you) , but I was sort of hoping this issue would recede . It would be useful to chat about this and other stuff if you are able to phone (afternoon my time preferably). Cheers Keith Date: Thu, 16 Nov 2006 11:57:09 +0000 To: Martin Juckes , \"Myles Allen\" From: Keith Briffa Subject: Re: Mitrie: Bristlecones Cc: anders@misu.su.se, Eduardo.Zorita@gkss.de, hegerl@duke.edu, esper@wsl.ch, weber@knmi.nl, t.osborn@uea.ac.uk Martin and all, I know Franco very well - but he has not worked extensively with the Bristlecones. I still believe that it would be wise to involve Malcolm Hughes in this discussion - though I recognise the point of view that says we might like to appear (and be) independent of the original Mann, Bradley and Hughes team to avoid the appearance of collusion. In my opinion (as someone how has worked with the Bristlecone data hardly at all!) there are undoubtedly problems in their use that go beyond the strip bark problem (that I will come back to later). The main one is an ambiguity in the nature and consistency of their sensitivity to temperature variations. It was widely believed some 2-3 decades ago, that high-elevation trees were PREDOMINANTLY responding to temperature and low elevation ones to available water supply (not always related in a simple way to measured precipitation) . However, response functions ( ie sets of regression coefficients on monthly mean temperature and precipitation data derived using principal components regression applied to the tree-ring data) have always shown quite weak and temporally unstable associations between chronology and climate variations (for the high-elevations trees at least). The trouble is that these results are dominated by inter-annual (ie high-frequency) variations and apparent instability in the relationships is exacerbated by the shortness of the instrumental records that restrict analyses to short periods, and the large separation of the climate station records from the sites of the trees. Limited comparisons between tree-ring density data (which seem to display less ambiguos responses) imply that there is a reasonable decadal time scale association and so indicate a real temperature signal , on this time scale .The bottom line though is that these trees likely represent a mixed temperature and moisture-supply response that might vary on longer timescales. The discussion is further complicated by the fact that the first PC of \"Western US\" trees used in the Mann et al. analyses is derived from a mixture of species (not just Bristlecones ) and they are quite varied in their characteristics , time span, and effective variance spectra . Many show low interannual variance and a long-term declining trend , up until about 1850 , when the Bristlecones (and others) show the remarkable increasing trend up until the end of the record. The earlier negative trend could be (partly or more significantly) a consequence of the LACK of detrending to allow for age effects in the measurements (ie standardisation) - the very early sections of relative high growth were removed in their analysis, but no explicit standardistion of the data was made to account for remaining slow width changes resulting from tree aging. This is also related to the \"strip bark\" problem , as these types of trees will have unpredictable trends as a consequence of aging and depending on the precise nature of each tree's structure . Another serious issue to be considered relates to the fact that the PC1 time series in the Mann et al. analysis was adjusted to reduce the positive slope in the last 150 years (on the assumption - following an earlier paper by Lamarche et al. - that this incressing growth was evidence of carbon dioxide fertilization) , by differencing the data from another record produced by other workers in northern Alaska and Canada (which incidentally was standardised in a totally different way). This last adjustment obviously will have a large influence on the quantification of the link between these Western US trees and N.Hemisphere temperatures. At this point , it is fair to say that this adjustment was arbitrary and the link between Bristlecone pine growth and CO2 is , at the very least, arguable. Note that at least one author (Lisa Gaumlich) has stated that the recent growth of these trees could be temperature driven and not evidence of CO2 fertilisation. The point of this message is to show that that this issue is complex , and I still believe the \"Western US\" series and its interpretation in terms of Hemispheric mean temperature is perhaps a \"Pandora's box\" that we might open at our peril! What does Jan say about this - he is very acquainted with these issues? cheers Keith At 15:01 15\/11\/2006, Martin Juckes wrote: Hi, Concerning Bristlecones, I had a sympathetic reply from Prof. North, but he deferred to the person who wrote the relevant paragraph in the NAS report (Franco Biondi) who is firmly of the view that strip-bark bristlecones should not be used. I've read a few of the articles cited to back up this statement and I am surprised by the extreme weakness of the evidence. There is one study of 27 strip-bark pines which shows that they clearly developed anomalous growth around 1850. Attributing this to CO2 is odd, to say the least.

I look at this in two ways. The first is to look at the difference between the observed and expected anthropogenic trend relative to the pdf for unforced variability. The second is to remove ENSO, volcanoes and TSI variations from the observed data. Both methods show that what we are seeing is not unusual. The second method leaves a significant warming over the past decade. These sums complement Kevin's energy work.

The poll showed that more than 70 percent of both Senator Sanders' supporters and Secretary Clinton's supporters would vote for the other Democratic candidate in a general election. and and roughly the same number and 72 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually later elected to in a landslide victory. Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to only 55 percent of Republicans. 43 percent of Republicans are also \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican party. This echoes what we've seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut : Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed. New York : Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side. It's clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged.","label":0}

Point the first, I doubt if they are trying to change Rumsy's mind but rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt. Point the second. Historicaly the \"in yer face\" mode of confrontation has been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds \"grass roots\" movements. Witness the big bold \"in yer face\" signature of Hancock on the \"in yer face\" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing powers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in examplare form upon digging. Now point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the \"in yer facers\" have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are teh very fule the \"in yer facers\" hope to ignite. If your burning, your being used.

{"text":"For Immediate Release May X, 2016 Contact - DNC Press 202-863-8148 DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz's Statement on Governor Kasich's Announcement that he is Suspending his Campaign for President \"With Governor Kasich out of the race, any remaining hope the GOP had of concealing their true colors behind his comparatively friendly-faced candidacy has evaporated. But make no mistake, the extreme policies he has long fought for are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and the rest of the modern Republican Party. \"For years, Republican leaders have employed a cynical, divisive political strategy to compel voters to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate - rewarding those at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT community and more in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickering Republican base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republican primary isn't for anything, and their final contest is already shaping up to be a bitter, petty battle with one camp against Trump, and the other against Cruz. \"The contrast couldn't be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are fighting for the American people - for higher wages, for more opportunity, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. That's why our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day in November.\" ###","label":0}

The Emission group is developing into a business that entails Enron's core skill sets. The Emission group is developing origination, mid-marketing, and finance as well as continuing to focus on the trading side of the business. On January 1st, 2002, the Houston-Galveston Mass Emission Cap & Trade Program begins in our backyard. This program is designed to reduce the emissions in the Houston-Galveston area by 90% by the year 2007. The program includes Harris county and the surrounding seven adjacent counties. Enron has emerged early as the dominant player in this cap and trade program. Enron has already become an active player by making the initial trades in NOx DERCs (Discrete Emission Reduction Credit) market. Enron has almost made numerous trades in the NOx ERC market. Trevor Woods and Michael Taylor have recently joined the Emissions Trading Group. The group, which includes trader John Massey, looks to become a principal player in many regional and national emission cap and trade programs, including San Joaquin County and NOx SIP CALL. Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS) ACCRO Phase III - IV We are pleased to announce that final acceptance has been received by our client Accroven SLR (50%Enron) from PDVSA-Gas (Venezuela's National Gas Company) for the facilities built and performance tested by our Accro Project Team. Thus completing the final major milestone on what must be considered to be one of EEOS's most successful projects. Although contracted as one $320MM project, the work had to be managed as four distinct jobs. The prime site, at Jose, consists of a grassroots 50,000 bpd NGL's Fractionation Plant plus Offsite Refrigerated Storage; the latter facilities, being contained entirely within PDVSA's existing live plant, had to be built entirely under PDVSA's Hot-work Permitting system. In addition, the site was under constant threat of disruptive action by very vocal and active Unionized workers. Thanks to the negotiating skills of our Site Manager, Tony Burke, they were shut-down only 25% as much as three adjacent major projects .The secondary sites, at Santa Barbara and San Joaquin, contained two grassroots 400MMSCFD Propane Extraction Plants. Not only did their remoteness cause significant logistical problems for equipment delivery, but also both had significant labour relations problems peculiar to their own locations. San Joaquin suffered many days of Force Majeure delay caused by the disruptive action by several local community groups protesting lack of work. Despite all the impediments of the local labour, logistics, and the usual customs clearance issues, the construction was essentially finished on schedule. Commissioning and start-up brought new challenges with erratic feedstock qualities testing both the design and the expertise of our start-up crews. It is a tribute to both, that all performance tests were passed within 48 hours of receiving a reasonably stable supply and the design flow rates, and that the plants have remained online since, or available, with minimal hiccups, generating significant income for our client. Congratulations Accro Project Team! Bob Meckna, Tony Burke, Andy Trevino, Dennis Zitterkopf, Bill Johnson and the rest of the team at site, in Houston, and from Teesside for achieving a remarkable success for which all participants can be proud; not only has the client gotten plants that exceed performance, the team was able to bring home double the budgeted profit. IN THE NEWS Enron All-Employee Meeting: At the All-Employee Meeting on August 16, Ken Lay, Enron president and CEO, provided employees with a general overview of Enron's performance to date and his expectations for the remainder of the year. Lay stated that Enron has faced a number of challenges including the California situation and Dabhol, but the company is facing and overcoming them. According to Lay, the Enron business model and strategy are sound and the exceptional employees at Enron will accelerate the company to becoming the \"world's leading company.\" The All-Employee Meeting video will be posted on the Enron home page within the next few days.

The deal means EES will source gas and electricity to provide steam, compressed air, chilled water and other industrial commodities to one of the largest breweries in Europe. EES will also have responsibility for managing a series of energy reduction measures at the plant, designed to improve performance and reduce costs. These measures will include investment in new boiler, refrigeration, compressed air and effluent treatment plant. Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: \"Closing this deal was an outstanding effort by the entire team and is another example of the type of innovative energy partnerships we are forming in the marketplace. This transaction, coupled with the Sainsbury's deal, has caused the industry to start taking notice of EES, and I am confident more customers will be knocking on our door looking for similar structures.\" Congratulations to everyone on the team for their dedication! Enron signs first long-term dry bulk shipping freight origination deal with major Japanese player Enron's shipping freight team has signed a 10-year time charter deal for a 178,000 tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping (with a performance guarantee from Mitsui & Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The agreement has a notional value of USD60 million and a mark-to-market value of USD 5 million. The new agreement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up to an additional four years, if required. The agreement takes effect from the latter part of 2003 when the ship itself, currently being manufactured in the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel, becomes available. \"We are already in the process of onselling the first three years of our time charter above the curve,\" announces Pierre Aury, who heads up Enron's dry bulk freight team. \"This deal gives us a strategic long \"days\" position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our drive to commoditise more time charter transactions.\" The team is already exploring new time charter deals in the scarcer cape-size and handy-size vessel market. A combined effort between the legal, tax, credit, transport support and structuring teams was instrumental in helping to book this deal just in time for Q2. The shipping freight team is already working on a new structured deal with a major UK bank, so watch this space for future announcements... Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enron's Shipping Desk On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital Bankruptcy Swap (DBS) from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese industrial\/trading counterparty. Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk will receive pay-out from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolvent under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that the desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty. When the level of the shipping desk's mark to market profit rises above a certain amount, the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection. Similarly, if the desk's contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates earlier, the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit. \"We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us,\" said Pierre Aury who heads up the freight team. \"Another driver was that we felt we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning curve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future.\" \"The hedge between these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enron's internal risk management. With each commercial group having to optimise its capital at risk, the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent complement to our already sophisticated RAC process,\" commented Ted Murphy, Head of RAC in Europe.

From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Friday, April 29, 2016 12:13 PM To: Freundlich, Christina; Walker, Eric; Walsh, Tom; Paustenbach, Mark Cc: RR2 Subject: FOR REVIEW: -- Senate Judiciary Misses Key Milestone Under GOP Obstruction SL: Senate Judiciary Misses Key Milestone Under GOP Obstruction It's been 44 47 days of Republican obstruction since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, meaning that this last week marked the average amount of time it takes the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on a nominee to the Supreme Court. That's an unprecedented failure on the part of Republican Senators to do their job. The Constitution is clear: it's the President's job to nominate Supreme Court justices, and it's the Senate's job to advise and consent, giving a nominee a fair consideration with a hearing and vote. Not in our modern political system has it taken this long to fulfill a Supreme Court vacancy, let alone refuse to give the nominee a fair hearing a vote. Ironically, the obstruction comes as And yet, some Republican lawmakers are still refusing to acknowledge Trump as their standard bearer baron for the Republican party, even as he tightens his grip on the GOP nomination. It's striking that even as they tacitly acknowledge that Trump lacks the judgment and temperament to serve as President, the and the one they are waiting for to Republican Senators are refusing to do their own job in order to hand Trump the responsibility to nominate a Supreme Court justice. Last week, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley even admitted that it would be \"a gamble\" to let Trump fill the vacancy. That disconnect is partly why the American people are increasingly opposed to the Republican obstruction, and want Republican Senators to do their job and allow a hearing and a vote. * 52% of voters now believe Republican Senators should do their job and vote on the nomination of Chief Judge Garland this year, up from 43% in February. * Americans overwhelmingly oppose Donald Trump or Ted Cruz making the next appointment, with 62% saying they do not trust Trump and 57% saying they do not trust Cruz to nominate a Supreme Court justice. * Vulnerable Republican Senators are also starting to see the negative effects of their unprecedented obstruction. In New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte's support for the Republican leadership's refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland has hurt her in the eyes of voters, with her net favorability rating dropping 13 points since February. In Ohio, 59% of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Senator Rob Portman's decision to block Chief Judge Garland's nomination. And in Pennsylvania, 62% of voters want the Senate to hold hearings and a vote on the nomination, corresponding to a rise in Senator Pat Toomey's unfavorability rating . Republicans have chosen to play politics rather than do their jobs and fulfill the most basic constitutional requirements. The gridlock and dysfunction coming from Republicans in the Senate is exactly why the American people are tired of Washington. And their message couldn't be clearer: stop the obstruction and do your job.

{"text":"NSM HQ actions in the Detroit news today. Members of NSM HQ in Detroit, backed up by members from NSM Ohio distributed hundreds of flyers in the Detroit area yesterday. During our distribution in Mount Clemons we ran into a white victim of the recent gang assaults. He was given a flyer. Read the news article below: www.detnews.com\/apps\/pbcs.dll\/article Wednesday, June 18, 2008 Mount Clemens summit to look at youth violence Mayor organizes session in response to vandalism at high school, assault by mob on three victims. Candace Begody \/ The Detroit News *MOUNT CLEMENS --* The Mount Clemens mayor plans to organize a summit to address youth violence in the wake of two recent incidents involving teens. \"We need to take a proactive stance in the community,\" Mayor Barb Dempsey said Tuesday. \"We need to come up with a way to rectify these issues.\" Last month, 25 graduating seniors allegedly vandalized Mount Clemens High School, and in a separate incident, a mob of 20 to 30 men was said to have assaulted three victims in separate locations in the city, seriously injuring one. [image: Click Here] Five suspects have been charged in connection with the attacks on three people in Mount Clemens. Though specific details have not been set, Dempsey said the meeting will take place shortly after the Fourth of July. It may replace a previously scheduled town hall meeting on crime that was tentatively planned for July 15. She added that the meeting is likely to be scheduled at the newly built Cairns Community Center. \"I don't know what to expect of the meeting,\" Dempsey added, \"but I'm hoping that we can stand together strong and come up with something that won't cost an arm and a leg.\" Community leaders applaud the plan. \"It's an excellent idea,\" said Greg Murray, president of the Mount Clemens Community School District Board of Education. \"But I hope action comes out of it. People get together and make statements, and there's no action. I want there to be something tangible coming out of it.\" A total of nearly 40 clergy members, school board members, community activists and law enforcement officials can expect to receive letters about the proposed meeting, said Dempsey, adding that the letters will be completed by Friday. The meeting will be open to the public. A separate meeting with business and bar owners and downtown officials will be held later to discuss related issues. The mob attack continues to generate controversy in Macomb County. County Sheriff's officials said several people were ticketed Tuesday for distributing fliers in the area, citing the attacks. *The fliers, which also listed an address and Web site for the National Socialist Movement, said in part: \"This sort of savagery must not be tolerated! We must reclaim our neighborhoods ... we must fight back before things get even worse! White men and women must stand together against gang violence.\"* *Detroit News Staff Writer Mark Hicks contributed to this report.

The group's recommendation: The board should resign... While former trustee Lawrence Eppley served as a conduit for requests from ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich's inner circle and former board Chairman Niranjan Shah leaned on university leaders to create a six-figure job for his future son-in-law, Carroll says she intervened only on behalf of applicants from underrepresented areas or demographic groups.

Board of Trustees resigns: \"The chairman of the University of Illinois' Board of Trustees resigned Monday amid an investigation into the use of political clout to get underqualified students into the school. Niranjan Shah said in a letter to Gov. Pat Quinn that he decided to step down after members of a state commission investigating the admissions practices said they believed the trustees should resign. Shah is the second trustee to do so, after former chairman Lawrence Eppley quit last week.\" I am not in public service for self-aggrandizement and therefore have no interest in a protracted process regarding my role,\" Shah wrote. \"My interest is solely in the vitality of the University of Illinois.\" The school's flagship campus at Champaign-Urbana has been at the center of a storm since the Chicago Tribune reported in May that the school maintained a list of politically connected students, known as Category I. The newspaper said some underqualified members of the list were admitted under pressure from former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, university trustees and others. Quinn said Monday he accepted Shah's resignation, which is effective in 90 days, or sooner if a successor is in place. He said the search for a successor would begin immediately. Shah had been accused of pushing to admit certain applicants and arranging for his future son-in-law to work for the school. Shah has denied trying to admit relatives to the school or being pressured by public officials to support certain applicants. University spokesman Thomas Hardy said the school respects Shah's decision and appreciates his service. Quinn appointed the Illinois Admissions Review Commission after the Category I list became public. Commission member Bernard Judge of Chicago said he was glad Shah resigned.\" I think he did the university a favor by resigning now,\" Judge said. \"It will end any further need to seek his resignation.\" The panel's final report is due this week.\" [The Associated Press - 8\/3\/09] * Six counties in 60 seconds: \"Dean intervened on admission: A University of Illinois dean says he intervened on behalf of a student who had been denied admission to a master's degree program.

The firm has not been accused of wrongdoing. Companies associated with Shah have received more than $30 million in state contracts over the last five years and have contributed more than $53,000 to Blagojevich since 2000. Shah also hosted a fundraiser at his home for the former governor. \"Niranjan Shah would like to have a quiet lunch or dinner,\" reads one entry.

Some, including Illinois Finance Authority Chairman Bill Brandt and University of Illinois board member Niranjan Shah, were slated to host fundraisers but did not due to the ex-governor's arrest. The hit list was drawn up in September and federal investigators obtained it in October. The list was used to get permission to tap Blago's phone lines and the Sun-Times obtained an updated version in December, shortly before Blago's arrest. The document is likely to be used in the ex-governor's indictment -- which might be made public later this week. [Chicagoist - 3\/29\/09] * They gave big, they got big; 'Pay-to-play' probe looking at firms that were big Blago donors: \"Another firm named in the subpoena is Globetrotters Engineering Corp., headed by Niranjan Shah, recently named chairman of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. Globetrotters has gotten hundreds of millions of dollars in city and state business, and one of its subsidiaries helps run concessions at O'Hare Airport. Shah said his company gets government contracts on merit, not as a result of the thousands of dollars in campaign contributions he has given to Blagojevich and others. \"I don't think we got any special treatment,\" Shah said. \"We are very careful. We're a very good firm. We do lots of good projects. We have been in business for 35 years.\" Blagojevich's former chief of staff, Lon Monk, was Globetrotters' lobbyist the last two years. Shah said the relationship ended in December, when Monk's contract expired.

{"text":"Will This Be The Most Do-Nothing Year Of A Staunchly Unproductive Congress? A budget, appropriations bills and legislation on Puerto Rico have all been at a standstill. 04\/29\/2016 02:01 pm ET WASHINGTON - If you ask Republicans what's the most significant piece of legislation they've passed this year, you're unlikely to get a quick, definitive response. \"I'd have to give it some thought,\" Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said Friday. \"I'd have to go back and look,\" Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said earlier this week. \"We're changing America,\" Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said with a laugh, in response to a question about Congress filling its days by renaming post offices and designating the bison as the national mammal. Congress is so bad at passing laws, they couldn't even get that bison bill right. The Senate passed the bill in December, but because of a factual error - the Senate called Nov. 1, 2014, the second annual National Bison Day when it was the third - the House passed a brand-new bill on Tuesday, meaning this important legislation still requires further action before it goes to the president's desk. On Thursday, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) listed a number of legislative accomplishments - a highway bill, an education bill, a customs laws rewrite - but none of those accomplishments were actually accomplished this year. \"Honestly, the big basics, the big issues, that's what this divided government will not produce,\" Ryan said, seeming to blame the inaction on President Barack Obama. But a Democrat in the White House doesn't explain Congress' internal dysfunction. Lawmakers left town Friday not having acted on legislation to help Puerto Rico, not having done a budget and not completed action on a single appropriations bill. To date, 31 pieces of legislation have been written into law this year, and hardly any of them would qualify as major. And with the House scheduled to be in session for just 66 more days this year and the Senate - whose schedule is a bit more informal - slated for a similar number, 2016 could be a historically unproductive year for Congress. On Friday, Ryan called House Republicans together, kicked out the staff and had what aides and members called a \"family discussion\" on the budget and appropriations. As Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) told The Huffington Post, Ryan was actively trying to bring the conference together to do a budget. \"In the old days, with Boehner, it would have been just a stonewall there. There would have been no dialogue,\" Yoho said. \"Paul is like, 'We've got to fix this. We're on the same team.'\" Republicans emerged from that conference meeting with some renewed hope that they could get the votes for a budget when they return on May 10. Either way, however, it's pretty clear that Republicans will move forward with some appropriations bills when they come back. Without a budget, the House has had to wait on bringing spending bills to the floor. But after May 15, the House is allowed to bring up appropriations legislation even if they haven't finished a budget - and from the discussion on Friday, it was clear to lawmakers that Ryan intends to do just that. The Senate is currently working on an energy and water appropriations bill, but Republicans were unable to end debate on the bill after a controversial Iran amendment was proposed. The bill still stands a chance of getting through when senators return - but it also could be the start of the appropriations process breaking down this year. As for legislation to restructure Puerto Rico's debt, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) told HuffPost he was confident Congress would act before a large debt payment comes due on July 1. Bishop said the remaining issues with the bill were small and that negotiators were working through minor language issues. \"Like, do you put the words 'consideration with,' or do you not put 'consideration with' in the bill,\" Bishop said. Pressed on whether that meant the Treasury Department had signed off on the legislation - which is key if Democrats are going to support the measure - Bishop clarified that, no, it hadn't yet. And pressed on whether conservatives had signed off on the bill - which could be key to getting enough Republicans - Bishop clarified that, no, they hadn't either. Legislating ain't easy.","label":0}

From: Shestopal, Olivia Sent: Friday, May 06, 2016 12:48 PM To: Price, Jenna; Rachel Palermo Cc: Garcia, Walter; Miranda, Luis; Julie Greene (GreeneJ@dnc.org) Subject: For Your Review: Weekly Update Hi all, Please find our draft of this week's update for your review. Please let us know your feedback. Thanks, Olivia -- Dear DNC Member, This week, Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced that they have their suspended campaigns, and Donald Trump has officially clinched the Republican nomination. With this, the GOP establishment meltdown continues. There are some Republican Senators, such as Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley , who feel that this is the moment they've been waiting for to push the Republican agenda and lay the pathway for a Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee. However, other prominent GOP figures, including former Republican presidential nominees and current House Speaker Paul Ryan , are neglecting to support their Party's candidate for President. The notion of Donald Trump as a candidate is terrifying. The New York Times posted an article on Wednesday proposing that within Trump's first 100 days he would do nothing to help Americans and their families. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates raised serious concerns about Donald Trump's judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next Commander-in-Chief. And while Donald Trump would be disastrous for our country's national security at home and abroad, his economic policies are just as dangerous . Furthermore, he continues to take every opportunity to bash the free press , spending this week peddling conspiracy theories , including the notion that vaccination causes autism, and questioning whether President Obama was born in the United States. While many registered Republicans are lashing out at Trump's take-over of their party, some even posting videos where they burn their voter registration cards in response to Trump's victory in Indiana, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates , with exit polls consistently reporting Democrats feeling energized by our primaries. \"The contrast couldn't be more stark,\" DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement , \"Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day in November.\" Have a safe and happy weekend.

{"text":"By Ben White | 05\/05\/2016 08:00 AM EDT TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON DEPORTATION - In an interview with NBC \"Nightly News\" on Wednesday night, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump again said he would seek to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States: \"Yes, they're going to be deported. Look, we either have a country, or we don't. We have many illegals in the country. And we have to get them out, and go through a process, go through a system. And ones that have done well and have really achieved, we want to bring 'em back in.\" Some economists believe doing this, especially in a single year, would dramatically reduce GDP and send the U.S. into recession and possibly depression. This could happen because many of the jobs done by immigrants (in restaurants, hotels etc.) would go unfilled. And the spending these immigrants do would vanish. Trump interview:  THE FIRST 100 TRUMP DAYS - NYT's Patrick Healy: \"He would start 'building a government based on relationships,' perhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan and Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters. ... On Inauguration Day, he would go to a 'beautiful' gala ball or two, but focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calling up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States.\" \"And by the end of his first 100 days as the nation's 45th leader, the wall with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.\"  LET'S TAKE ON A FEW OF THOSE - Calling up and haranguing business leaders over relocations seems more like the hallmark of Democratic administration. Republicans usually focus on changing the incentives that often cause companies to relocate, especially a complex tax code with the highest corporate rate in the OECD at 39 percent which is also the third highest in the world behind only Puerto Rico, Chad and the UAE. We are also not aware of executive authority to unilaterally \"punish\" individual companies that move jobs abroad. Trump can certainly design a wall and try to convince Mexico to fund it. But Mexico is probably not going to do that and Congress is not likely to approve the spending it would take to build the wall. Congress is also not likely to approve a ban on Muslims immigrating to the U.S. (which the Supreme Court could also toss out as an unconstitutional religious test). And the Fed is already extensively audited. So starting a new audit would be redundant. Changing oversight of the Fed would also require an act of Congress. GRAPH OF THE DAY - \"Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet; others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or 'too busy' to email, call or release a statement.\"  M.M. SIDE NOTE - I talked to multiple members of Congress at the Milken Conference and most of them wanted to change the subject when the question of supporting Trump came up. One GOP senator suddenly had an urgent meeting to get to as soon as I started down that line of questioning. THE BIG IDEA: IS THE ECONOMY BETTER THAN WE THINK? - Wells Capital's Jim Paulsen: \"The current economic recovery has been the slowest of the post-war era. Indeed, throughout this recovery, U.S. real GDP has hovered near the 'stall speed' of about 2 percent ... What if the pace of real GDP growth during this recovery was actually closer to 3 percent rather than sustaining near the Mendoza Line? \"Official reports suggest U.S. productivity has grown at its slowest pace of any economic recovery in the post-war era. ... However, the real wage rate has been climbing steadily throughout this recovery suggesting much stronger productivity performance and thereby stronger real GDP growth. Moreover, the growth of investment, consumer spending and job creation during this recovery also imply that the pace of overall economic growth in this recovery has been stronger than officially reported.\" THE BIG IDEA II: WAGE GAINS PICKING UP PACE - Via Goldman Sachs: \"While the large cumulative decline in labor market slack is broadly acknowledged, there remains a widespread belief that wages are not picking up. Looking across a range of indicators, we do see quite compelling evidence that wage growth has picked up although it remains below its estimated equilibrium level of 3-3.5 percent. \"Our preferred tool for summarizing wage growth is our composite GS wage tracker. ... [I]t has accelerated to a 2.5 percent rate, the fastest pace of the recovery so far. Our wage tracker continues to include the employment cost index, average hourly earnings, compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, and the Atlanta Fed's wage growth tracker based on the household survey\" MM SIDENOTE II - MM spoke to a Fortune 500 CEO on Wednesday who said the GDP number is essentially meaningless and employment, wages, the health of consumer and corporate balance sheets all reflect an economy doing significantly better than the official growth statistics show. TRUMP WON'T SELF FUND FOR THE GENERAL - WSJ's Monica Langley and Rebecca Ballhaus: \"Facing a prospective tab of more than $1 billion to finance a general-election run for the White House ... Trump reversed course Wednesday and said he would actively raise money to ensure his campaign has the resources to compete with Hillary Clinton's fundraising juggernaut. ... His campaign also is beginning to work with the [RNC] to set up a joint fundraising committee \"'I'll be putting up money, but won't be completely self-funding,' the presumptive Republican nominee said ... Mr. Trump ... added that he would create a 'world-class finance organization.' The campaign will tap his expansive personal Rolodex and a new base of supporters who aren't on party rolls, two Trump advisers said.\"  GOOD THURSDAY MORNING - A while back I said in this space that if Donald Trump won the GOP nomination I'd eat a bag of rusty nails. Now, I'm not actually going to eat nails (unless they are baked for me in some delicious form) because that would be very unhealthy. But boy was I wrong! Super, duper, totally and spectacularly wrong! Sure I have plenty of company in this regard. But still. I completely underestimated Trump's ability to manipulate the media and hijack the GOP. I pat myself on the back when I'm right but also try to cop to it when I'm wrong. So, mea culpa! ... Email me your non-booze related rusty nail recipes to bwhite@politico.com and follow me on Twitter @morningmoneyben. THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES - Jon Prior on a House investigation of the CFPB's arbitration rule proposal -- and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m.-- please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com HOW TRUMP BLACK-SWANNED POLITICS - BI's Myles Udland: \"Back in 1998, the world of finance learned a very painful lesson: Models break and markets aren't efficient. And with the rise of Donald Trump from sideshow to presumptive Republican nominee, politics has learned the same lesson. ... [LTCM] was a hedge fund staffed by several Nobel Prize winners that possessed a supposedly unmatched grasp on how markets work. \"The firm had the most sophisticated methods for exploiting any and all inefficiencies, millions and millions of times over. And it blew up. Spectacularly. ... Trump was not only written off as a marginal and unserious candidate because he himself is so unserious, but also because no outsider candidate with no establishment support and using only his money to fund his campaign could, the theory goes, win a nomination. ... [T]he party itself failed - the market failed to self-correct its inefficiency ... and thus the arguments undergirded by a belief in a coherent party structure inevitably fell apart.\"  ASIA DOWN AGAIN - Reuters: \"Asian shares slipped for a seventh straight session on Thursday as mixed economic data did nothing to assuage concerns about global growth, keeping sovereign bonds well supported as a hedge against deflation risks. The latest survey from China showed the service sector expanded at a slower pace in April, though firms did resume adding staff. ... Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were at their lowest in two weeks at 1.777 percent, a notable rally from last week's top of 1.94 percent.\"  PROGRESSIVE TO FED: STAY PUT - In a paper going out this a.m. from the Economic Policy Institute, Josh Bivens and Dean Baker argue that the Fed \"should not use bubbles (real or imaginary) as an excuse to raise interest rates\"  TRUMP BEGINS WAY BEHIND - POLITICO's Steven Shepard: \"Trump begins the general-election phase of the campaign facing the prospect of a near-historic blowout defeat. And pollsters think he might be so far in the hole that he can't dig himself out. He's trailing Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by margins not seen in a generation. Despite Trump's frequent claims to the contrary, he trails Clinton, his most likely opponent, in nearly every hypothetical general-election poll thus far - often by wide margins. \"Overall, the HuffPost Pollster average of public polls gives Clinton a 7-point edge, 47 percent to 40 percent. A CNN\/ORC International poll conducted just before Tuesday's Indiana primary found Clinton leading Trump by 13 points among registered voters nationally, 54 percent to 41 percent. ... One serious problem confronting Trump is the fact that he enters the general election more defined than the party's last nominee, Mitt Romney - meaning Trump has less room to grow in the polls and describe himself to voters on his own terms\"  ECB KILLS THE 500-EURO NOTE - NYT's Jack Ewing: \"A suitcase stuffed full of cash may soon be worth a lot less. In a move aimed at hampering cash transactions by terrorists, drug dealers and money launderers, the European Central Bank ... announced an end to the 500-euro bank note, worth roughly $575. When it comes to moving money nefariously, the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd500 note has been especially handy. \"It is a large denomination in a widely circulated and easily convertible currency. In the United States, the largest denomination is $100, after the Federal Reserve discontinued the $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000 bills in 1969. Switzerland has a 1,000-franc note, worth about $1,050, but its supply is limited. The \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd500 note is also more compact and convenient for evading the gaze of authorities. The equivalent of $1 million, in that high euro note, weighs about five pounds and fits in a small bag\"  BUSINESSES WORRIED BY TRUMP - FT's Barney Jopson: \"Trump's emergence as the presumptive nominee of the traditional party of business has left uneasy companies facing a candidate with policies their own top lobbyist has labelled as 'stupid'. ... Business leaders usually depend on the Republican nominee to defend their interests, but mirroring the horror of mainstream party supporters, they have been aghast to see him assailing them as part of a failing establishment ... More than anything else, business has been troubled by Mr. Trump's protectionist threats to rip up trade deals and impose punitive tariffs on imports. \"Mr. Trump has threatened to target US companies that move manufacturing overseas - such as Apple, Carrier, the air-conditioner maker, and Mondelez, the Oreo-maker - with financial penalties and presidential hectoring. ... On Wednesday a Chamber spokesperson said the group would not discuss Mr. Trump and his personality, but said companies confronted 'extraordinary political and geopolitical uncertainty\" and added: 'Politicians should think twice before bashing business.'\"  TRUMP EYES VEEPS - POLITICO's Hanna Trudo: \"Trump could assign a new nickname to one of his past rivals: Veep. In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Wednesday night, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said he would consider Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio for possible spots in his administration.\"  TREASURY COULD BUY BACK OLD DEBT - FT's Joe Rennison: \"The US Treasury has debated a sweeping overhaul of the $13tn government bond market, including a proposal to buy back old debt as officials focus on the health of trading in a core asset of many global investment portfolios. The idea being discussed would involve retiring older Treasury debt, then replacing it with new benchmark securities, which are more widely traded ... \"The overhaul, which would be designed to improve trading conditions, has only been quietly discussed and could go nowhere as current Treasury officials are likely to leave office after November's elections. But the topic is now also gaining ascendancy among industry participants, while discussion of extensive debt buybacks highlights an official focus on the structure and efficiency of the Treasury market after wild price swings stunned investors in October 2014\"  GUNDLACH: GET READY FOR A DEBT-DRIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP - Bloomberg: \"Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, told attendees at the Sohn Investment Conference to prepare for a Donald Trump presidency. 'What's going to happen is you're going to get a Reagan response with Donald Trump,' Gundlach told the New York crowd. \"'He promises a wall, he promises to bring jobs back, and he promises a lot of infrastructure spending. Let's face it: Trump is extremely comfortable with debt.' ... The money manager predicted that if Trump wins the White House, the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product will rise.\"  To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to kaplanj@dnc.org by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Blvd. Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Eystein and Peck, sorry for the overlong silence at this end. We *are* working on the revised figures, etc. and thanks for the CLIMBER and BERN EMIC data - Keith and I must look at this and see how best to show it. In the meantime, I just wanted to forward to you a paper that we have coming out in Science next Friday - see the *uncorrected* page proofs attached. Please treat this in confidence and for IPCC purposes only - I'm sure you're aware of their strict embargo policy. The reason we thought it worth forwarding was because it is useful for comparing implied MWP and 20th century NH temperatures and thus might be appropriate for use in the IPCC \"MWP box\". The approach is similar to that which Susan Solomon seemed to be keen on - looking at individual series, but simply counting how many simultaneously imply warmth or cold conditions. There's also the possibility that one of its figures (perhaps panel 3B) might be useful in the \"MWP box\". If you have time for a quick read, please tell us what you think. Eystein - you were also wanting some regional proxy series and I thought I'd send you the data shown in Fig 1 of this paper, because I'm preparing a file to accompany the paper anyway and this will kill two birds with one stone. Are these data what you were hoping for? I'll send them later today if they are.

Best regards, Jesse Smith ======================= Dr. Jesse Smith Senior Editor ---------------------------------------------- Science 1200 New York Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20005 USA ---------------------------------------------- (202) 326-6556 (202) 408-1256 (FAX) hjsmith@aaas.org ======================= >>> Tim Osborn 3\/3\/2006 11:22:17 AM >>> Dear Jesse Smith and Brooks Hanson, thank you for your patience while waiting for our reply. Before responding to the specific data requests, we would like to say that it is our view that we should provide sufficient data to enable all the main elements of our analysis to be checked, but that we are not obliged to provide the data that would enable the research reported in other papers to be checked, even if we cite those other papers or use results reported in those other papers. You will see how this view has determined our response to some of the requests. Now to the requests themselves, numbered according to the numbering system of Steve McIntyre's email. (1) As you know, we provided (in advance of publication) the 14 smoothed and normalised proxy records to WDC-Paleo that enable the main parts of our analysis to be replicated. The only part of our analysis for which the unsmoothed data are required is to calculate the correlations against temperature that we reported for some of the series (not those that had already been reported by Mann and Jones, as indicated in our Table S1). These unsmoothed data for all 14 series are now also archived at WDC-Paleo, which will enable those correlations that we reported in Table S1 to be checked. These unsmoothed data were archived on Thursday 23rd February, in response to a request by a different colleague. This should cover this request in full. (2) Our Table S1 provides the full citation to the source of our data, funnily enough given in the column labelled \"Data source\". Some of these may or may not have publicly archived their data, but our WDC-Paleo entry now contains the series that we were originally provided with (i.e., the unsmoothed data that we refer to in item (1) above). The \"Orig source\" column in our table was our effort to ensure that original work on collecting\/processing these data is acknowledged, because it is important for us to acknowledge that work even when we obtained the data from a secondary study. We did not intend to imply that the data that we had used would match the data in these original sources, because various different versions might exist (due, e.g., to different methods of processing the data, or due to updated measurements, etc.). That is why we made the source of our data clear. (a-c) We have not yet had time to double check the ITRDB citations that we provided for these three records, but we will do so as soon as we have time. Our data source was in fact Esper et al. (2002) and this is correct, so the concern over the accuracy of these ITRDB citations does not limit the ability for others to check our work. (d-f) The original studies that we cite are definitely correct for these two records. We have provided sufficient data for our analysis of these records to be checked. We have not provided extra data to enable other people's studies to be checked, nor do we feel obliged to do so. (g) These series from Esper et al. (2002) were considered by us and then rejected. As we understand it, Esper et al. have made available their site RCS records and therefore these four records could be obtained from Esper et al. If this is not the case, we could provide these four rejected series. (3) D'Arrigo et al. (2006) do *not* report directly opposite findings in respect to the correlations we obtain for Jaemtland and Boreal\/Upperwright. Neither paper reports any correlations involving these series versus temperature. Both papers list more than one reason why series might be rejected. For example, our reasons were \"We removed series from (S1) that did not correlate positively with their local annual or summer temperatures (Table S1), or which did not extend into the period with instrumental temperature to allow a correlation to be calculated.\" The latter is our reason for excluding Jaemtland, not the former: the Jaemtland series that we obtained from Esper et al. (2002) has no data after 1827 and so no correlation was calculated. The Jaemtland series used by D'Arrigo et al. continues through to 1978 due to the inclusion of additional data. Similarly, D'Arrigo et al. list a number of reasons for excluding series, but they do not state which one(s) were used to exclude Boreal and Upperwright, though in fact none disagreed with our criteria anyway! We have not separately stored the temperature time series used to obtain the correlations reported in our Table S1 and to do so requires some changes to our program, which we have not done because there does not appear to be a need to do so (given our explanation above of the situation regarding our paper versus D'Arrigo et al., 2006). Because Steve McIntyre has explicitly stated that he is unable to verify our results for the Boreal\/Upperwright case, we have extracted the temperatures we used for that case only and attach them here as a text file. We hope that he can use them to reassure himself about the correlations that we obtained. (4) (a) We explicitly state that we did not use the Esper et al. (2002) Jasper series, so there is no expectation that they should be identical. Esper et al. (2002) have, we believe, made their version available and we have made available the series that we used via WDC-Paleo. (b) Similarly, we explicitly state that we did not used the Esper et al. (2002) Tornetrask series and data are available as for (a). (c) We are not obliged to confirm anything that Esper et al. (2002) did. (5) This request is not relevant to our paper, as discussed at the start of this email. (6) Same as (5). We hope that we have dealt with these requests to a more than satisfactory extent, but please let us know if you feel that we should do more.

He is Hispanic. We can unify this party.\" [Austin American-Statesman, May 2, 2016 ] CHASER: Cruz campaign quickly backtracked and told the Washington Examiner she misspoke, saying, \"Heidi was referring to Ted as being the son of an immigrant.\" To clarify, \"Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and lived there until his family moved to the U.S...\" The article noted, \"Another reason Cruz would want to distance himself from the \"immigrant\" label could be his stance on undocumented immigration -- especially when it comes to Mexico.\" \"Yes, we should deport them, we should build a wall, we should triple the border patrol,\" he [Ted Cruz] has said.\" \"...now that Cruz has been mathematically eliminated from clinching the GOP nomination, his campaign's efforts to clarify his wife's statement might not be worth it anyway.\" Read the full story here ###","label":0}

{"text":"From: Hillary For America Press Sent: Thursday, May 12, 2016 12:06 PM To: Hillary for America Press Subject: UPDATE: Ryan Again Refuses To Endorse Trump as Conservative Opposition To The GOP Nominee Grows ***UPDATED*** Ryan Again Refuses To Endorse Trump as Conservative Opposition To The GOP Nominee Grows Since Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president last Tuesday, the chorus of Republicans and conservative commentators from around the country rejecting his unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy has grown daily. Donald Trump has proven himself to be a loose cannon whose hateful language and dangerous policies will do serious harm to working families and put America's security at risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a President Trump would be too big a risk. Today, Speaker Ryan met with Donald Trump, but he clearly wasn't swayed by the nominee as he again refused to endorse him. CNN's Tom LoBianco : .@SpeakerRyan will not say whether he is endorsing or will endorse @realDonaldTrump Watch this video and keep reading below for some of the greatest hits of Republicans rejecting and condemning Donald Trump: Watch the Video: \"GOP Unity?\" Rosario Marin, former U.S. Treasurer under President George W. Bush : \"I have been the spokesperson for five presidential Republican campaigns. I have attended the previous five Republican national conventions. I'm not going this year, and I am not campaigning for him. I would never, never, ever vote for the little orange man.\" Former Senator Gordon Humphrey [R-NH] : \"\"Unequivocally, I am not supporting Donald Trump. \u2026 I think he is a sociopath.\"\" Former Romney staffer Garrett Jackson : \"Sorry Mr. Chairman, not happening. I have to put country over party. I cannot support a dangerous phony.\" Former top Romney strategist Stuart Stevens : \"I think Donald Trump has proven to be unbalanced and uniquely unqualified to be president. I won't support him\u2026 Everyone has to make their own choice. I think Trump is despicable and will prove to be a disaster for the party. I'd urge everyone to continue to oppose him.'\" Nevada Senator Dean Heller : \"I vehemently oppose our nominee and some of the comments and issues he brought up during the campaign.\" Former McCain adviser Mark Salter : \"The GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks it's on the level. I'm with her.\" Former VA Gubernatorial candidate, Ken Cuccinelli on Trump : \"When you've got a guy favorably quoting Mussolini, I don't care what party you're in, I'm not voting for that guy.\" Billionaire Bush-backer Mike Fernandez : \"If I have a choice \u2014 and you can put it in bold \u2014 if I have a choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton, I'm choosing Hillary.\" Former top Romney strategist Stuart Stevens : \"I think Donald Trump has proven to be unbalanced and uniquely unqualified to be president. I won't support him\u2026 Everyone has to make their own choice. I think Trump is despicable and will prove to be a disaster for the party. I'd urge everyone to continue to oppose him.'\" Fox News' Steve Deace : \"Apparently @secupp has a #NeverTrump list to see who keeps their word to the end. You can sign my name in blood.\" Washington Examiner's Phillip Klein : \"I have officially de-registered as a Republican.\" Former RNC Chairman Mel Martinez : \"I would not vote for Trump, clearly.\" Rep. Carlos Curbelo [R-FL] : \"I have already said I will not support Mr. Trump, that is not a political decision that is a moral decision.'\" Sen. Ben Sasse [R-NE] : \"Mr. Trump's relentless focus is on dividing Americans, and on tearing down rather than building back up this glorious nation. \u2026 I can't support Donald Trump. Jennifer Rubin : \"But it is really fundamentally an issue of character. When people look at Donald Trump and they see how he treats women, they see his views on foreigners, they see his lack of personal self-control, his meanness. Just this week he was back lying again.\" Mac Stipanovich, former Chief of Staff to Gov. Bob Martinez : \"On a personal level, Trump is a boor, a bully, a carnival barker and an embarrassment. Politically, by intent or instinct, he is a neo-fascist\u2026 He appeals to our fears, preys on our anxieties and exploits our ignorance. A worse candidate to sit in the Oval Office for the next four years cannot be imagined.\" Bill Kristol : \"You embrace the endorsement of a rapist in Mike Tyson, a man convicted of raping a 17-year old girl, and you don't express any, when it's pointed out to you, you don't say, \"Yeah, well that was horrible\" [\u2026] On the day of the Indiana primary, he spins this conspiracy story [\u2026] about Ted Cruz' father being complicit in the assassination of a president of the United States. [\u2026] You know, for me, the one thing, though [\u2026] \u2014it was the mocking of the disabled New York Times reporter, which is such a humanely grotesque thing to do, and then he just lies and says \"I didn't do it.\" Washington Post: 'I feel like I got smacked by a 2x4': Va. Republicans react to Trump as the likely nominee : With the departure of Ted Cruz from the presidential race Tuesday night, many national Republican loyalists lamented the future of a party that could field a nominee as polarizing as Donald Trump. But the news was particularly jarring for Virginia Republicans fresh off two days of party warfare at a state convention where Cruz came out on top.\" Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin : \"With every noxious movement, dangerous leader and misguided endeavor, there are people who should know better but who cheer, enable or passively accept horrible ideas. To those cheerleading Donald Trump: Be prepared to shoulder a heavy burden, a soul-crushing weight for the next six months. New York Times: With Donald Trump in Charge, Republicans Have a Day of Reckoning : \"Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet; others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or \"too busy\" to email, call or release a statement.\" Texas Tribune: Bush 41, 43 Have No Plans to Endorse Trump : \"For the first time since his own presidency, George H.W. Bush is planning to stay silent in the race for the Oval Office \u2014 and the younger former president Bush plans to stay silent as well. Bush 41, who enthusiastically endorsed every Republican nominee for the last five election cycles, will stay out of the campaign process this time. He does not have plans to endorse presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.\" Jennifer Rubin: Who wants to defend Trump for the next six months? : \"Donald Trump's noxious behavior and erratic views force his supporters to condone all sorts of unacceptable things. Even his own advisers find it hard to excuse his conduct.\" Conservative blogger Erick Erickson : \"Reporters writing about the \"Stop Trump\" effort get it wrong. It's 'Never Trump' as in come hell or high water we will never vote for Trump\" Townhall editor Guy Benson : \"Much to my deep chagrin (& astonishment ~8 months ago), for the 1st time in my life, I will not support the GOP nominee for president.\" Redstate contributor Leon Wolf : \"I will never vote for Donald Trump. I will not vote for him in the general election against Hillary, and I would not vote for him in a race for dogcatcher. Heck, I would not even vote for him on a reality television show.\" Undersecretary of State under George W. Bush, Eliot Cohen : \"I will oppose Trump as nominee. Won't support & won't work for him for more reasons than a Tweet can bear.\" Rep. Louie Gohmert [R-TX] : \"Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert balked at backing Trump without an apology for his rhetoric toward Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and warned that Trump could cost Republicans a majority in Congress. \"I had no fear of losing the House until I saw this weekend the commercial against Sen. John Boozman in Arkansas. They run quote after quote from Donald Trump's mouth,\" Gohmert told Fox Business Network. \"This is a dangerous time.\"\" Bloomberg: Big-Spending Fracking Family Behind Cruz Won't Back Trump : \"Add the conservative Wilks family of Texas, among the biggest spenders in the presidential race so far, to the list of donors who won't support Donald Trump in the general election.\" Alan Steinberg, former regional EPA administrator under George W. Bush : \"Said he's actually voting for Hillary Clinton, with whom he worked when she was U.S. senator for New York. \"She can work with people on the opposite side of the political aisle,\" he said.\" Loudon Times-Mirror [Virginia]: High-profile Virginia Republicans lining up against Donald Trump : \"Many long-time Virginia Republicans found themselves despondent Wednesday after Donald Trump became the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee. \"Twenty-nine years of Republican activism down the drain,\" former state Del. David Ramadan, a Dulles-area conservative, told the Times-Mirror. \"I feel like someone stuck a knife in me.\"\" Wisconsin Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke : Steineke \"who has called Trump \"a liberal and a liar,\" hedged in his opposition, but said Wednesday he does not currently support the presumptive nominee.\" Rep. Barbara Comstock [R-VA] : \"Comstock\u2026 listed several reasons why she felt the billionaire businessman was not a good role model, including his derogatory remarks about women and prisoners of war, and for not immediately disavowing the Ku Klux Klan. 'All of these things are hugely problematic and don't represent our party,' she said at that time. 'I don't think somebody should represent my party who disrespects America's veterans. We're the party of Lincoln. We're the party of Reagan.'\" Andy Card, former White House Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush : \"When he started to gain traction, I became a cynic. I wasn't sure he could make it. I was saying, 'sane people will recognize this is not going to happen.' Well, it happened. He scared me.\" Mitt Romney : Politico: \"Add Mitt Romney to the list of Republicans who won't support Donald Trump as the presumptive party nominee\u2026 The former Massachusetts governor said he is 'dismayed at where we are now' and wishes Americans had 'better choices.'\" Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee : \"In a new sign of the Republican Party's reservations about Mr. Trump, the top strategist in charge of defending Republican control of the Senate said in a briefing for lobbyists and donors on Thursday that the party's candidates should feel free to skip the nominating convention in Cleveland in July.\" Lindsey Graham : \"I do not believe he is a reliable Republican conservative\u2026do not believe he is a reliable GOP conservative nor has he displayed the judgment and temperament to serve as Commander in Chief.\" Jeb Bush : \"Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy.\" John Weaver, Chief Strategist for John Kasich : On working for Trump: \"Under no circumstances. I'm an American first. And I don't want to elaborate on that.\" On whether Kasich would be Trump's VP: \"Under no circumstances. \u2026 If you're the kind of conservative who believes that everyone matters, that this is about uniting \u2026 where does that fit into what Donald Trump has said?\" Ohio Auditor Dave Yost : \"an early resident of the never-Trump camp, took to Facebook to express his disappointment, writing of the New Yorker's 'utter lack of principled convictions.'\" ### For Immediate Release, May 12, 2016 Contact: press@hillaryclinton.com PAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA Contributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.

{"text":"I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today. They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work. I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM\/d Kern expansion in 2003. I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity. However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity. Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu\/d. I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM\/d. Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely. If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest. Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years. Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments. -----Original Message----- From: Whitt, Mark Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 4:54 PM To: Miller, Stephanie; Polsky, Phil; Tycholiz, Barry Cc: Bump, Dan J.; Lucci, Paul T.; Miller, Paul; Reitmeyer, Jay; Harrison, Tyrell Subject: RE: Western Frontier Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?

Thanks all From: demcommunications@googlegroups.com On Behalf Of Walker, Eric Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 9:13 AM To: demcommunications@googlegroups.com Subject: [COMMUNICATIONS] Press events re: this week's Trump\/Ryan meeting Hey everyone \u2013 Tomorrow, Donald Trump is coming to Washington D.C. to meet with Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, and Mitch McConnell. The Ryan meeting is the highlight because Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump thus far. This is an ideal opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives not ready to fully endorse his Party's nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates, former Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates trying to distance themselves from their standard bearer. We're asking state party communications directors to put together events around Thursday morning's Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the message that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. We're also asking state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio. Attached please find a packet with materials to put together an event. In this packet you'll find: \u00b7 Sample talking points \/ message guidance \u00b7 A sample advisory \u00b7 A sample press release \u00b7 A sample op-ed \u00b7 Four sample letters to the editor DNC can offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out to walker@dnc.org if you would like to book one of our surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washington can also use our studio to do local hits. Here's what we're looking for in terms of event logistics: \u00b7 Types of speakers: o State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs o Local Elected Officials o Allied Groups \u2013 Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc. o Labor o People sharing personal stories \u00b7 About 15-20 supporters \u00b7 Signs that say \"Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda\" \u2013 we have a mockup that can be found here . \u00b7 A big push to get local TV to the event \u2013 studies show that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news. The Republican Party has elevated offensive policies and extreme voices using divisive campaigns for years, and now they're stuck with Donald Trump's reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general election. We have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every state accountable for their Party's dysfunction as they chaotically tumble toward the general election. And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreement that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support either one of our candidates. This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Republicans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle-down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking Americans. It's the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession . We can't afford to go back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.

Wade Evinced The United States' Slide \"Toward A Culture Of Death.\" \"Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of this country. They are missing, and they are missed.\" [Donald Trump Op-Ed, Washington Examiner, 1\/23\/16 ] Donald Trump: \"The Supreme Court In 1973 Based Its Decision [In Roe v.

Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress.

This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.\" [Donald Trump Op-Ed, Washington Examiner, 1\/23\/16 ] From: Crystal, Andy Sent: Thursday, May 05, 2016 9:52 AM To: RR2 Subject: Trump\/Grassley SCOTUS Couple things here: Attached the doc I put together a while back when Trump was supposedly releasing his list of potential nominees. Here's the article where Grassley said he believes Trump would nominate the right type of justice based on the fact Trump previously mentioned Bill Pryor as a potential nominee. Des Moines Register: Grassley: Trump Would Nominate 'Right Type' To Court Last week, Grassley said it would be a 'gamble' to let Trump fill the vacancy: Huffington Post: Chuck Grassley Admits It's 'A Gamble' To Let Trump Fill SCOTUS Vacancy Bill Pryor's Greatest Hits: * Called Roe v. Wade \"the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\" * Opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest. * Urged Congress to repeal Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. * Was the only Attorney General in the nation to file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the federal remedy for victims of sexual assault in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional. * In 2005, Lambda Legal called Pryor \"the most demonstrably antigay judicial nominee in recent memory.\" And here is a release Rachel and I put together about all of Trump's potential nominees to prepare for him possibly releasing a list. He should definitely be pressed to release it now - all of these judges fall right into our narrative over the past few weeks (terrible for women, for voting rights, for the LGBT community). It never went back around RR2 so here it is: SL: Whom Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley Are Holding Out For Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have long been waiting for this day - to see whom their party's frontrunner would consider nominating to the Supreme Court. The day has finally come, and it's nothing pretty. \"The Supreme Court nominating process is serious, Donald Trump is not. Again and again he has demonstrated he lacks the experience and temperament to be an effective commander-in-chief. So it comes as no surprise that his list of top picks for the Supreme Court is full of red flags. \"The justices judges he wants to elevate to our highest court have a history of making the same sort of unpredictable, extreme decisions that we see every day from Trump. It's bad enough that Senate Republicans refuse to uphold the Constitution, do their jobs and hold hearings on President Obama's eminently qualified nominee. But, it's worse that the reason for the obstruction is their hope that Trump would get to nominate one of these judges.,\" - DNC Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland - but Senate Republicans continue to say they won't meet with Chief Judge Garland, hold a hearing or vote on his nomination. So instead, let's take a closer look at whom the Republicans are holding out for: Diane Sykes * Throughout her career, Diane Sykes has supported partisan republican efforts to restrict access to the ballot box. voter obstruction measures. In 2014, she voted in favor of upholding Wisconsin's restrictive photo voter ID law, one of the strictest in the nation, which could block 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin from casting their ballots. law only eight weeks before an election in which Scott Walker was in a tight gubernatorial race. Sykes also joined authored an opinion that same year that declared major portions of gutted major portions of Wisconsin's campaign finance reform law unconstitutional, giving special interest groups more influence in our elections. * In 2013, Sykes authored an opinion restricting that restricted a woman's access to birth control, which was described as the \"broadest ruling\" so far by a federal appeals court barring enforcement of the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act. Bill Pryor * After George W. Bush nominated Bill Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit, Senate Democrats filibustered his nomination because of his extreme positions on abortion. Pryor opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest, and he called Roe v. Wade \"Tthe worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\" * In 2009, Pryor authored the Eleventh Circuit's decision upholding Georgia's strict voter ID law. Years earlier, he urged Congress to repeal Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. * Pryor was the only Attorney General in the nation to file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that a provision in the Violence Against Women Act that allowed victims to file suit in federal court was unconstitutional that the federal remedy for victims of sexual assault in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional. * Pryor has a long history of opposing LGBT rights. In fact, in 2005, Lambda Legal called Pryor \"the most demonstrably antigay judicial nominee in recent memory.\" * Editorial boards across the country denounced Bush's nomination of Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit, including the Washington Post, New York Times , and numerous local outlets. Brett Kavanaugh * As a Circuit Judge, Brett Kavanaugh was one of the staunchest critics of President Obama's environmental rules efforts to combat climate change and he authored an opinion that struck down the EPA's cross-state air pollution rule. * Throughout his career, Kavanaugh has used his judicial authority to increase the influence of money in politics. In 2009, he authored an opinion that ruled that the government can't restrict political spending by nonprofit groups or political committees. In addition, Kavanaugh authored an opinion that upheld South Carolina's restrictive voter ID law. * Kavanaugh has argued that a president may refuse to enforce a law if he or she personally deems that law unconstitutional, even if the Supreme Court has previously upheld it. should have the authority to decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the president deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional. Paul Clement * Paul Clement has taken action on his out-of-touch views on immigration, serving as lead counsel to defend SB 70, Arizona's extreme immigration law. Republicans have continually hired Paul Clement to defend their out of touch views on immigration, health care, and LGBT rights. * Governor Jan Brewer hired Clement as lead counsel to defend SB 70, Arizona's extreme immigration law . * Clement has \"pledged to the destruction \" of the Affordable Care Act, which would take away quality, affordable health insurance from millions of 20 million Americans. He served as lead counsel in the lawsuit that first challenged the authority of the ACA. * In 2011, Clement was hired by John Boehner hired Clement to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court, and in 2012, Clement was hired by Governor Nikki Haley hired Clement to defend South Carolina's strict voter ID law. * Clement also represented corporate interests the International Franchise Association in a lawsuit to block Seattle's $15 an hour minimum wage law. Steven Colloton * Steven Colloton has consistently held dangerous positions on women's health. He joined an opinion that found the opt-out provision to the ACA's contraception mandate unenforceable against non-profit organizations restricted women's access to birth control under the Affordable Care Act. He also voted to uphold a South Dakota law requiring physicians to disclose an increased risk of suicide to women seeking safe and legal abortions. Don Willett * As a judge on the Texas Supreme Court, Don Willett has time and again ruled in favor of special interests at the expense of consumers and workers. In fact, Willett ruled in favor of corporate interests 81 percent of the time. * Willett authored an opinion that protected industrial plants and refineries from liability suits by contract workers who claimed their they were injured on the job due to the negligence of their employers. Texas Watch, a nonpartisan citizen advocacy organization, called Willet's majority opinion in this case \"the most activist decision in years\" that would allow companies to \"avoid accountability for workplace safety violations.\"","label":0}

{"text":"--- begin forwarded text From: A guy who models plasma all day... To: \"R. A. Hettinga\" Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel... Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600 Bob, This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well thought out. Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors. They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms. If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw\/kg (~4 hp\/kg!) -- and punch it through an electric motor. How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh? If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor. And it's not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag! On to the Lunarnationals? Or would you prefer the bite of donut? ----- Original Message ----- From: \"R. A.

{"text":"Stratfor: Geopolitical Intelligence Report - September 6, 2006 Iraq: The Policy Dilemma By George Friedman U.S. President George W. Bush now has made it clear what his policy on Iraq will be for the immediate future, certainly until Election Day: He does not intend to change U.S. policy in any fundamental way. U.S. troops will continue to be deployed in Iraq, they will continue to carry out counterinsurgency operations, and they will continue to train Iraqi troops to eventually take over the operations. It is difficult to imagine that Bush believes there will be any military solution to the situation in Iraq; therefore, we must try to understand his reasoning in maintaining this position. Certainly, it is not simply a political decision. Opinion in the United States has turned against the war, and drawing down U.S. forces and abandoning combat operations would appear to be the politically expedient move. Thus, if it is not politics driving him -- and assuming that the more lurid theories on the Internet concerning Bush's motivations are as silly as they appear -- then we have to figure out what he is doing. Let's consider the military situation first. Bush has said that there is no civil war in Iraq. This is in large measure a semantic debate. In our view, it would be inaccurate to call what is going on a \"civil war\" simply because that term implies a degree of coherence that simply does not exist. Calling it a free-for-all would be more accurate. It is not simply a conflict of Shi'i versus Sunni. The Sunnis and Shia are fighting each other, and all of them are fighting American forces. It is not altogether clear what the Americans are supposed to be doing. Counterinsurgency is unlike other warfare. In other warfare, the goal is to defeat an enemy army, and civilian casualties as a result of military operations are expected and acceptable. With counterinsurgency operations in populated areas, however, the goal is to distinguish the insurgents from civilians and destroy them, with minimal civilian casualties. Counterinsurgency in populated areas is more akin to police operations than to military operations; U.S. troops are simultaneously engaging an enemy force while trying to protect the population from both that force and U.S. operations. Add to this the fact that the population is frequently friendly to the insurgents and hostile to the Americans, and the difficulty of the undertaking becomes clear. Consider the following numbers. The New York Police Department (excluding transit and park police) counts one policeman for every 216 residents. In Iraq, there is one U.S. soldier (not counting other coalition troops) per about 185 people. Thus, numerically speaking, U.S. forces are in a mildly better position than New York City cops -- but then, except for occasional Saturday nights, New York cops are not facing anything like the U.S. military is facing in Iraq. Given that the United States is facing not one enemy but a series of enemy organizations -- many fighting each other as well as the Americans -- and that the American goal is to defeat these while defending the populace, it is obvious even from these very simplistic numbers that the U.S. force simply isn't there to impose a settlement. Expectations and a Deal Unwound A military solution to the U.S. dilemma has not been in the cards for several years. The purpose of military operations was to set the stage for political negotiations. But the Americans had entered Iraq with certain expectations. For one thing, they had believed they would simply be embraced by Iraq's Shiite population. They also had expected the Sunnis to submit to what appeared to be overwhelming political force. What happened was very different. First, the Shia welcomed the fall of Saddam Hussein, but they hardly embraced the Americans -- they sought instead to translate the U.S. victory over Hussein into a Shiite government. Second, the Sunnis, in view of the U.S.-Shiite coalition and the dismemberment of the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Army, saw that they were about to be squeezed out of the political system and potentially crushed by the Shia. They saw an insurgency -- which had been planned by Hussein -- as their only hope of forcing a redefinition of Iraqi politics. The Americans realized that their expectations had not been realistic. Thus, the Americans went through a series of political cycles. First, they sided with the Shia as they sought to find their balance militarily facing the Sunnis. When they felt they had traction against the Sunnis, following the capture of Hussein -- and fearing Shiite hegemony -- they shifted toward a position between Sunnis and Shia. As military operations were waged in the background, complex repositioning occurred on all sides, with the Americans trying to hold the swing position between Sunnis and Shia. The process of creating a government for Iraq was encapsulated in this multi-sided maneuvering. By spring 2006, the Sunnis appeared to have committed themselves to the political process. And in June , with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and the announcement that the United States would reduce its force in Iraq by two brigades, the stage seemed to be set for a political resolution that would create a Shiite-dominated coalition that included Sunnis and Kurds. It appeared to be a done deal -- and then the deal completely collapsed. The first sign of the collapse was a sudden outbreak of fighting among Shia in the Basra region. We assumed that this was political positioning among Shiite factions as they prepared for a political settlement. Then Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, the head of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), traveled to Tehran, and Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army commenced an offensive. Shiite death squads struck out at Sunni populations, and Sunni insurgents struck back. From nearly having a political accommodation, the situation in Iraq fell completely apart. The key was Iran. The Iranians had always wanted an Iraqi satellite state, as protection against another Iraq-Iran war. That was a basic national security concept for them. In order to have this, the Iranians needed an overwhelmingly Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad, and to have overwhelming control of the Shia. It seemed to us that there could be a Shiite-dominated government but not an overwhelmingly Shiite government. In other words, Iraq could be neutral toward, but not a satellite of, Iran. In our view, Iraq's leading Shia -- fearing a civil war and also being wary of domination by Iran -- would accept this settlement. We may have been correct on the sentiment of leading Shia, but we were wrong about Iran's intentions. Tehran did not see a neutral Iraq as being either in Iran's interests or necessary. Clearly, the Iranians did not trust a neutral Iraq still under American occupation to remain neutral. Second -- and this is the most important -- they saw the Americans as militarily weak and incapable of either containing a civil war in Iraq or of taking significant military action against Iran. In other words, the Iranians didn't like the deal they had been offered, they felt that they could do better, and they felt that the time had come to strike. A Two-Pronged Offensive When we look back through Iranian eyes, we can now see what they saw: a golden opportunity to deal the United States a blow, redefine the geopolitics of the Persian Gulf and reposition the Shia in the Muslim world. Iran had, for example, been revivifying Hezbollah in Lebanon for several months. We had seen this as a routine response to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. It is now apparent, however, that it was part of a two-pronged offensive. First, in Iraq, the Iranians encouraged a variety of factions to both resist the newly formed government and to strike out against the Sunnis. This created an uncontainable cycle of violence that rendered the Iraqi government impotent and the Americans irrelevant. The tempo of operations was now in the hands of those Shiite groups among which the Iranians had extensive influence -- and this included some of the leading Shiite parties, such as SCIRI. Second, in Lebanon, Iran encouraged Hezbollah to launch an offensive. There is debate over whether the Israelis or Hezbollah ignited the conflict in Lebanon. Part of this is ideological gibberish, but part of it concerns intention. It is clear that Hezbollah was fully deployed for combat. Its positions were manned in the south, and its rockets were ready. The capture of two Israeli soldiers was intended to trigger Israeli airstrikes, which were as predictable as sunrise, and Hezbollah was ready to fire on Haifa. Once Haifa was hit, Israel floundered in trying to deploy troops (the Golani and Givati brigades were in the south, near Gaza). This would not have been the case if the Israelis had planned for war with Hezbollah. Now, this discussion has nothing to do with who to blame for what. It has everything to do with the fact that Hezbollah was ready to fight, triggered the fight, and came out ahead because it wasn't defeated. The end result is that, suddenly, the Iranians held the whip hand in Iraq, had dealt Israel a psychological blow, had repositioned themselves in the Muslim world and had generally redefined the dynamics of the region. Moreover, they had moved to the threshold of redefining the geopolitics to the Persian Gulf. This was by far their most important achievement. A New Look at the Region At this point, except for the United States, Iran has by far the most powerful military force in the Persian Gulf. This has nothing to do with its nuclear capability, which is still years away from realization. Its ground forces are simply more numerous and more capable than all the forces of the Arabian Peninsula combined. There is another aspect to this: The countries of the Arabian Peninsula are governed by Sunnis, but many are home to substantial Shiite populations as well. Between the Iranian military and the possibility of unrest among Shia in the region, the situation in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Peninsula is uneasy, to say the least. The rise of Hezbollah well might psychologically empower the generally quiescent Shia to become more assertive. This is one of the reasons that the Saudis were so angry at Hezbollah, and why they now are so anxious over events in Iraq. If Iraq were to break into three regions, the southern region would be Shiite -- and the Iranians clearly believe that they could dominate southern Iraq. This not only would give them control of the Basra oil fields, but also would theoretically open the road to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. From a strictly military point of view, and not including the Shiite insurgencies at all, Iran could move far down the western littoral of the Persian Gulf if American forces were absent. Put another way, there would be a possibility that the Iranians could seize control of the bulk of the region's oil reserves. They could do the same thing if Iraq were to be united as an Iranian satellite, but that would be far more difficult to achieve and would require active U.S. cooperation in withdrawing. We can now see why Bush cannot begin withdrawing forces. If he did that, the entire region would destabilize. The countries of the Arabian Peninsula, seeing the withdrawal, would realize that the Iranians were now the dominant power. Shia in the Gulf region might act, or they might simply wait until the Americans had withdrawn and the Iranians arrived. Israel, shaken to the core by its fight with Hezbollah, would have neither the force nor the inclination to act. Therefore, the United States has little choice, from Bush's perspective, but to remain in Iraq. The Iranians undoubtedly anticipated this response. They have planned carefully. They are therefore shifting their rhetoric somewhat to be more accommodating. They understand that to get the United States out of Iraq -- and out of Kuwait --they will have to engage in a complex set of negotiations. They will promise anything -- but in the end, they will be the largest military force in the region, and nothing else matters. Ultimately, they are counting on the Americans to be sufficiently exhausted by their experience of Iraq to rationalize their withdrawal -- leaving, as in Vietnam, a graceful interval for what follows. Options Iran will do everything it can, of course, to assure that the Americans are as exhausted as possible. The Iranians have no incentive to allow the chaos to wind down, until at least a political settlement with the United States is achieved. The United States cannot permit Iranian hegemony over the Persian Gulf, nor can it sustain its forces in Iraq indefinitely under these circumstances. The United States has four choices, apart from the status quo: 1. Reach a political accommodation that cedes the status of regional hegemon to Iran, and withdraw from Iraq. 2. Withdraw forces from Iraq and maintain a presence in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- something the Saudis would hate but would have little choice about -- while remembering that an American military presence is highly offensive to many Muslims and was a significant factor in the rise of al Qaeda. 3. Halt counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and redeploy its forces in the south (west of Kuwait), to block any Iranian moves in the region. 4. Assume that Iran relies solely on its psychological pre-eminence to force a regional realignment and, thus, use Sunni proxies such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in attempts to outmaneuver Tehran. None of these are attractive choices. Each cedes much of Iraq to Shiite and Iranian power and represents some degree of a psychological defeat for the United States, or else rests on a risky assumption. While No. 3 might be the most attractive, it would leave U.S. forces in highly exposed, dangerous and difficult-to-sustain postures. Iran has set a clever trap, and the United States has walked into it. Rather than a functioning government in Iraq, it has chaos and a triumphant Shiite community. The Americans cannot contain the chaos, and they cannot simply withdraw. Therefore, we can understand why Bush insists on holding his position indefinitely. He has been maneuvered in such a manner that he -- or a successor -- has no real alternatives. There is one counter to this: a massive American buildup, including a major buildup of ground forces that requires a large expansion of the Army, geared for the invasion of Iran and destruction of its military force. The idea that this could readily be done through air power has evaporated, we would think, with the Israeli air force's failure in Lebanon. An invasion of Iran would be enormously expensive, take a very long time and create a problem of occupation that would dwarf the problem faced in Iraq. But it is the other option. It would stabilize the geopolitics of the Arabian Peninsula and drain American military power for a generation. Sometimes there are no good choices. For the United States, the options are to negotiate a settlement that is acceptable to Iran and live with the consequences, raise a massive army and invade Iran, or live in the current twilight world between Iranian hegemony and war with Iran. Bush appears to be choosing an indecisive twilight. Given the options, it is understandable why.

According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim populations.\" \u00b7 Trump has said he did not care if his call to ban all Muslims from entering the United States was \"politically incorrect.\" He argued that, \"We Have No Choice. We Have. No. Choice.\" \u00b7 This week, after Donald Trump reiterated his plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., London's newly-elected mayor Sadiq Khan rejected the insulting idea that he could be one of Trump's \"exceptions.\" [New link too]","label":0}

{"text":"Holy god these quotes.... From: Kauffman, Nathan Sent: Friday, May 06, 2016 12:26 PM To: Comm_D Subject: WaPo: Trump will soon be getting briefings from U.S. spy agencies. It might not go well. That headline. (flagging the Clinton mention as well) Where should the U.S. intelligence community's first PowerPoint presentation for Trump begin? \"It beggars the imagination,\" said former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who was among those who briefed President Obama after the 2008 election. \"Given that [Trump's] public persona seems to reflect a lack of understanding or care about global issues, how do you arrange these presentations to learn what are the true depths of his understanding?\" Trump will soon be getting briefings from U.S. spy agencies. It might not go well. By Greg Miller May 5 at 4:04 PM Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told my colleague Robert Costa that he is eager to start meeting with U.S. intelligence officials for classified briefings on the nation's secrets. The feeling may not be mutual. The outlandish GOP candidate is not known for discretion or nuanced understanding of global security issues, let alone awareness of the widespread revulsion among U.S. intelligence officials over some of Trump's positions - including his expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and pledge to resume torturing terrorism suspects. Where should the U.S. intelligence community's first PowerPoint presentation for Trump begin? \"It beggars the imagination,\" said former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who was among those who briefed President Obama after the 2008 election. \"Given that [Trump's] public persona seems to reflect a lack of understanding or care about global issues, how do you arrange these presentations to learn what are the true depths of his understanding?\" Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. said last week that U.S. spy agencies have already begun planning briefings for Trump and his presumed Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, although neither is expected to receive an initial briefing before party conventions conclude in July. In response to a question from the Daily Beast , Clapper alluded to concern for the handling of any secrets shared. The process is designed \"to ensure that everybody gets the same information and that we do comply with the needs to protect sources and methods.\" Clinton's ability to protect sensitive information has also come under sharp criticism, after the disclosure that she relied on a private e-mail server to communicate with subordinates while serving as secretary of state. But she has likely participated in thousands of classified briefings - unlike Trump who has never been privy to the government's most closely guarded secrets. \"This is a person who doesn't seem to have much of a filter,\" said Aki Peritz, a former CIA analyst who contributed to the President's Daily Brief (PDB) - the digest delivered each morning to the Oval Office. \"The scary part is that nobody knows who he really is. Is he this blowhard demagogue we see on TV or is he really a sophisticated consumer of information that will keep this information close to his chest?\" Either way, Director of National Intelligence and CIA analysts may have little leeway in what they present. The decision on how much to share and when are traditionally made by the sitting president. \"The candidates get the same information - no favoritism,\" said David Priess, a former CIA briefer and author of \"The President's Book of Secrets ,\" a history of the PDB. \"It's not that the briefer can freelance.\" Pre-election briefings tend to be overviews of spy agency assessments of major topics such as the civil war in Syria. That changes after Election Day, however, when separate teams are sent in advance to the candidates' headquarters. The winner is given a deeper briefing on more highly classified material, including CIA operations overseas. The other team heads back to headquarters without briefing the losing candidate. Analysts selected for such assignments tend to be among the most polished and experienced in the intelligence community. \"They are going to be very professional,\" Peritz said, but Trump poses unique complications. \"He has all kinds of relationships with Chinese investors and Russian investors. He's spoken very highly of our adversaries. And he's talked about using torture and waterboarding and attacking people's families. All these things are going through the analysts' minds.\" -- Nathan Kauffman DNC Research Associate 574-849-4726","label":0}

April's tech award 1 million open jobs News.com: Top CIOs ZDNet: PeopleSoft July 11, 2002 Hollywood & Silicon Valley: A way out? The controversy over digital file swapping is no closer to an amicable resolution than it was when peer-to-peer technology first came into vogue. Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor\/Commentary Just desserts for scofflaws U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman weighed in this week, arguing that piracy over P2P networks robs songwriters on a massive scale. The congressman from Hollywood has authored a bill to stop illegal digital downloads by giving copyright owners the ability to technologically impair the distribution of copyrighted works. Read Full Story Spotting a scam in sheep's clothing Berman's proposal received a cool reception in Silicon Valley, where rules are frowned upon and unfettered innovation reigns supreme. So it was that StreamCast CEO Steve Griffin spoke for many in the community when he wrote that Berman's proposal won't work. What's more, he wondered, was Berman really concerned about controlling piracy, or could the congressman from Hollywood be influenced by certain constituents? Conspiracy buffs this week had a field day. Read Full Story How to curb digital piracy The odds that either side will raise the white flag are slim. But must this debate necessarily turn into an endless donnybrook? Former White House staffer Jonathan Greenblatt doesn't buy into historical determinism, and believes Hollywood can respond to the challenge of new media. First, it must shy away from any legislation that aims to control technology or enforces any \"draconian\" digital rights management rules. What other suggestions does he offer? Read on. Read Full Story Writing file sharing's final chapter All this occurs as the P2P community lost one of its brighter lights. Computer scientist and entrepreneur Gene Kan died June 29. Kan, who helped to develop an early open-source version of Gnutella software, wrote a column for CNET News.com on June 21, drawing on the lessons learned from the history of peer-to-peer technology. In this highly nuanced piece, Kan offers a timely warning about what can happen when people get overly excited about new technologies. Read Full Story CEOs: Are you too focused? Conventional wisdom has it that \"focus\" is de rigueur for any corporation hoping to achieve superior performance. The flip side of this argument is that markets are quick to discount the valuations of diversified companies because of perceived shortcomings. But researchers at McKinsey offer an alternative idea, suggesting that there's a particularly fertile middle ground between focus and diversification.

{"text":"This is an excellent idea, Mike, IN PRINCIPLE at least. In practise, however, it raises some interesting results (as I have found when attempting this myself) that may be difficult to avoid getting bogged down with discussing. The attached .pdf figure shows an example of what I have produced (NB. please don't circulate this further, as it is from work that is currently being finished off - however, I'm happy to use it here to illustrate my point). I took 7 reconstructions and re-calibrated them over a common period and against an observed target series (in this case, land-only, Apr-Sep, >20N - BUT I GET SIMILAR RESULTS WITH OTHER CHOICES, and this re-calibration stage is not critical). You will have seen figures similar to this in stuff Keith and I have published. See the coloured lines in the attached figure. In this example I then simply took an unweighted average of the calibrated series, but the weighted average obtained via an EOF approach can give similar results. The average is shown by the thin black line (I've ignored the potential problems of series covering different periods). This was all done with raw, unsmoothed data, even though 30-yr smoothed curves are plotted in the figure. The thick black line is what I get when I re-calibrate the average record against my target observed series. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT. The *re-calibrated* mean of the reconstructions is nowhere near the mean of the reconstructions. It has enhanced variability, because averaging the reconstructions results in a redder time series (there is less common variance between the reconstructions at the higher frequencies compared with the lower frequencies, so the former averages out to leave a smoother curve) and the re-calibration is then more of a case of fitting a trend (over my calibration period 1881-1960) to the observed trend. This results in enhanced variability, but also enhanced uncertainty (not shown here) due to fewer effective degrees of freedom during calibration. Obviously there are questions about observed target series, which series to include\/exclude etc., but the same issue will arise regardless: the analysis will not likely lie near to the middle of the cloud of published series and explaining the reasons behind this etc. will obscure the message of a short EOS piece. It is, of course, interesting - not least for the comparison with borehole-based estimates - but that is for a separate paper, I think. My suggestion would be to stick with one of these options: (i) a single example reconstruction; (ii) a plot of a cloud of reconstructions; (iii) a plot of the \"envelope\" containing the cloud of reconstructions (perhaps also the envelope would encompass their uncertainty estimates), but without showing the individual reconstruction best guesses. How many votes for each? Cheers Tim At 15:32 12\/03\/03, Michael E. Mann wrote: >p.s.

{"text":"Clinton: 'No way' I won't be Democratic nominee POLITICO By NICK GASS 05\/19\/16 02:17 PM EDT Hillary Clinton on Thursday said there is \"no way\" that she will not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, and that Bernie Sanders would do well to unify behind her as the party's standard-bearer against Donald Trump \"I will be the nominee for my party, Chris,\" the former secretary of state told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview from Park Ridge, Illinois. \"That is already done, in effect. There's no way that I won't be.\" As for Bernie Sanders, Clinton said \"he has to do his part to unify.\" \"He said the other day that he'll do everything possible to defeat Donald Trump. He said he'd work seven days a week. I take him at his word,\" Clinton said. \"I think the threat that Donald Trump poses is so dramatic to our country, to our democracy and our economy that I certainly expect Sen. Sanders to do what he said he would.\" Clinton dodged a question from Cuomo on whether she would choose Sanders as her running mate. \"What brings us together is Donald Trump. I think that's what brings us together,\" she said, after remarking that would be a discussion for later. Assessing her chances against Trump, Clinton said the party would unify. \"That doesn't mean we won't have some vigorous discussion and debate about issues, about the platform, about all of the process of a convention. I welcome that. I think that's healthy. I think bringing people into the party giving them a voice at the end is going to help us in the fall. I think as I said I will certainly do my part and more to reach out and bring in Sen. Sanders' supporters and I have every reason to expect he'll do the same,\" she said. \"I think we'll have a great convention in Philadelphia and then we'll go out and carry on the campaign against Donald Trump,\" Clinton continued. \"And the Republicans. And I really believe that we're going to have a strong, compelling case to make about the choice that the American people will be facing. And I feel, you know, very optimistic about how the election will come out and I also feel optimistic about the country.\"","label":0}

From: Paustenbach, Mark Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 10:15 AM To: Miranda, Luis; Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Banfill, Ryan; Tracie Pough; Dacey, Amy Subject: Weaver on CNN re Nevada FYI, this morning on CNN Jeff Weaver was asked about the protests and threats of violence in Nevada. He begins by saying Sanders supporters should \"act in a civil way\" but then goes on to hit the state party. Here is a transcript: Jeff Weaver-- \u2026 Well, look, the senator has been very clear, people who are supporting the senator should act in a civil way. They should obviously fight within the context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they should be there, they should present their case. And then they should let the votes fall where they may. The situation in Nevada is a little bit different. Obviously no context justifies any kinds of threat or violence. But you know, we have been obviously campaigning in Nevada for almost a year, because of, you know, it's one of the early states. The state party there has a lot of problems. They've run things very poorly. It has been done very undemocratically. And there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of the Nevada democratic party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process. If you read some of the reports from what went on there, the chair was clearly ignoring votes from the floor at the Clark county democratic convention in Nevada. They tried to arrest their own credentials chair, because she was being too fair to the Sanders people. I mean, it is dysfunctional or worse out there in the Nevada state democratic party. Obviously it is not a reflection of all Democrats in Nevada, but the party hierarchy, there's a lot of problems there. I mean they had a convention where they didn't have enough chairs for the number of people who were supposed to be there. Obviously you're trying to exclude people if the room is too small for the anticipated audience. So there is a lot of work to be done. We could have a whole show on the Nevada state democratic party. But regardless \u2013 Chris Cuomo, CNN-- You're making the same case that Trump seems to be making, the system is set up against Sanders, the Democrats are against him, and that he should run for a third party.

{"text":"DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz DNC State of the Union Reception 5.5.16 Kimmel Center - 6 p.m. 6 min remarks Intro Thank you Governor Rendell! We're so lucky to have a true Pennsylvania legend serving so graciously as the Philadelphia Host Committee Chair. Let me start by thanking everyone on the Executive Committee, all our community leaders and members of the Host Committee for your tireless work and commitment to our Party. I know you lead busy lives, but we can't pull off a successful convention without you. Let me also thank our CEO, the unparalleled Reverend, Leah Daughtry for her tireless work. We are so fortunate to have a lifelong Democrat of Leah's passion and expertise steering the ship; And of course I need to thank the honorable Mayor Jim Kenney, as well as all the wonderful people of Philadelphia who he represents. We are enormously grateful that you're hosting and warmly welcoming all the Democrats bringing their enthusiasm, energy, and passion as we arrive in greater and greater numbers over the next few months. And I know Mayor Kenney appreciates all the commerce we'll be bringing with us as conference goers visit Philly's great restaurants, hotels and small businesses. Gearing up We're just 80 days away from our Convention, and we've been making all the right moves to ensure we'll be one hundred percent prepared at kickoff time. We are on time, on budget and ready to run a beautiful convention. But as proud as I am of what we're doing, I have to mention how proud I am of who is doing it. Each day, as our numbers grow, we're making sure that our diversity does too. As Democrats, we believe our diversity is our great strength. That shows in the ranks of the DNC, where last year thirty-six percent of our employees were people of color. And we've awarded at least 35 percent of our contracts to companies owned by women, veterans, minorities, people with disabilities and members of the LGBT community. And when the nation looks at our convention, they'll see a portrait of America. Our Party Affairs and Delegate Selection team has worked tirelessly to ensure that every state party has an accessible and inclusive process for anyone to run to become a delegate. Whether it's a school teacher in Orlando, a plumber in Cleveland, or a high school student in Denver, our convention delegates will reflect the diversity our Party. Dangerous Donald But before anyone casts a vote to nominate the next Democratic president of the United States, let me give you a little update from the DNC. Today, and every day until Election Day, we are laser focused on take down holding Dangerous Donald Trump accountable - and winning seats up and down the ballot in every race across the country. With every other candidate out of the race, Trump is the Republican Party. We are not going to let anyone forget hold him accountable for everything he has said and everything he has done. And we are going to hold the GOP accountable for everything they're doing -- to obstruct, divide, and drag our country backwards. The facts are simple: Dangerous Donald is unfit to be president. He only looks out for himself. He lacks the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief. And every aspect of his presidency would harm our country and damage our standing in the world. Even as a candidate, Dangerous Donald has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably make America less safe. He has no foreign policy experience - but don't worry about that - he said he'll rely on his \"good brain,\" instead of listening to experts. Dangerous. He has a decades-long record of denigrating women. Seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy. He exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media. And recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric. He's making our communities less safe and he hasn't even gotten into office. And while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success, his record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes that are designed to turn a quick a buck at the expense of his workers or everyday Americans. I'll spare you all the details, but trust me - that's the short version of what the American people are going to be hearing about Dangerous Donald over the coming months. You know, there's a reason why we saw Republicans across the country this week tweeting photos of their burning voter registration cards this week. Advantage, Democrats Well, we have a message for anyone disillusioned and disaffected by this year's unprecedentedly nasty and divisive Republican primary - we have a message for anyone disgusted by Donald: You have a home in the Democratic Party. We have the best candidates, the best ideas, and a fantastic record of social and economic progress under President Obama to run on - 73 consecutive months of private sector job growth and 20 million Americans who have health insurance who didn't before. In poll after poll, Democratic voters are reporting that our primary and our candidates have energized our party. In Nevada, voter registration among Democrats is beating Republicans two-to-one. So no matter what challenges lie ahead in the planning and execution of our convention, let me just say, clearly and unequivocally - I am really, really glad we are not planning the Republican convention. And I am absolutely optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. Conclusion Finally, I'll just say, this convention is about so much more than the spectacle of big political speeches under red-white-and-blue balloons and confetti, although I think we might have some of that in store... This is about the direction of our nation. This is about the power of the people to come together and choose the best leader for the job. And no matter which of our candidates they choose, they'll be fighting every day for all Americans. We're fighting to level the playing field, raise wages, ensure equal pay, end discrimination, expand voting rights, make our country and our communities more secure and fighting to give hardworking Americans everywhere a fair shot. When it comes time to nominate our choices for President and Vice President, with your help, we will unify, fight together as Democrats. And friends, when the convention ends, we will go roaring into the general election with all the passion, grit and energy it takes to elect Democrats from the top of the ticket down. So thank you for all your work, thank you for your commitment to our party, and enjoy the rest of the evening. Thank you.","label":0}

The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.) Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was too small to survive on its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal. Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.) Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which observes that Continental Airlines \"soared to profitability\" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and pocketed 11 times its investment. Meanwhile, it will be \"business as usual\" for U.S. Airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel US Airways Files for Chapter 11 US Airways Announces Bankruptcy Shifts to Cause Rerouting of Some Booked Fliers US Airways Files for Bankruptcy Protection US Airways Group, Hit Hard By Terror, Files for Chapter 11 (Paid subscription required.) ----------------------------------------------------------------- ADVERTISEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------- You've heard about identity management, but do you know about the opportunities and business models that will emerge as a result?

Once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads. The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday a \"long-awaited\" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. \"The reality is we could have done considerably worse,\" the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher. Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah Asbrand Hobbled Global Crossing Accepts Buyout Bid From Asian Investors (Paid subscription required.)

{"text":"It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said, \"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is \"NEVER\". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here's the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That's how you're going to make the money. What I'm talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I've learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. I will provide that knowledge, and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you: *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings. *** Make money on the biggest news stories. *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use. *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell? Or am I going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\" Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself? With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future. Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH. Oops, they weren't laughing anymore. In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now. I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading. You don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort. It's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.

(Perkins Coie) Cc: Paustenbach, Mark Subject: Heads up... Republicans are looking for anything to mess with us on, so the Washington Examiner today at the White House briefing tried to bring me up as an example of someone who left the White House and then lobbied --- allegedly against the Administration's stated policy -- on Cuba. The White House flagged it for me. They're not going to engage any further so I have to get back to the reporter and knock it down. To be clear, I didn't lobby during my consulting tenure. I provided public affairs services, strategic communications and press engagement. To the extent I was in touch with the White House, it was to be supportive of what the White House was already doing. Any lobbying was handled by my clients without me. I'll keep you posted if anything else develops, but it is a bogus story. Here's the exchange from today's White House press briefing: **Draft** Susan, I'll give you the last one. Q Thank you, Josh. Two things. While you were out here in the briefing, it seems like CNN -- I'm looking on Twitter here so I can't be quite sure -- is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early belief is that a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down. I'm wondering if you can confirm that they've found wreckage and whether that -- if you could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb. MR. EARNEST: Well, I saw some of that reporting before I walked out here and I don't have an intelligence assessment to share at this point. Q Okay. The second question is a little more complicated. I'm wondering if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the President really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the administration -- there were some exceptions. But does he feel the same way about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the administration? That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up and be transparent about that disclosure? MR. EARNEST: Well, Susan, I don't have the details in front of me, but I know that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on his first day in office didn't just apply to individuals who might be considering employment in the federal government during the Obama administration; there were also commitments that incoming administration officials had to make about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government. And so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to former Obama administration officials. Q Does the White House advise people leaving, do they remind them of that and their requirements? Is there a process -- MR. EARNEST: Yes, there is -- as part of the out-boarding process, you're reminded of the commitments that you've made on the way in that would limit your job prospects on the way out. And look, many people have raised concerns about how historically there's been a revolving door between the federal government and K Street. And the President's efforts, again, that he initiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, both in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the government, but also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their way out. Q It's not just K Street that these individuals are going to. I'm wondering if the -- anybody left the White House that went to go on and lobby on behalf of engagement in Cuba, if -- and they're contacting administration officials, should they have registered to lobby? MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I assume -- it sounds now like you're asking about a specific case, and why don't we just walk through the details and -- help you understand how the rules might apply in a particular case. Q Sure. Luis Miranda left the White House. He went to the ** Group. He did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on that issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there's no lobbying disclosure records to show for that. I have written about this, but we've talked about a lot -- there's been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative this week, but there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the -- and the timeline -- and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timeline and what -- the transparency on those negotiations. That's why I'm asking. MR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can provide you some additional information. It sounds like -- I'm not sure that any of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a look. Q To Luis Miranda specifically? MR. EARNEST: Well, he doesn't work here anymore. Q Right, so that's why -- MR. EARNEST: So maybe you should go ask him. Q Right, I've tried to contact him and -- ** I've tried to contact him. MR. EARNEST: Okay. Q Is it important for the White House to have some level of -- on the Cuba issue to have had some level of surprise on that issue? Or I mean, is it the President's right and the White House's right to -- and the State Department -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a major initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another country? MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think that's entirely appropriate. And that certainly has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the United States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years. And when we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being unjustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensively in the past. When the United States was working behind the scenes with China to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon pollution in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiations I think were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States enjoyed significant benefits as a result. Those kinds of negotiations, that kind of diplomacy is often most effective when it's done behind the scenes, as you described it.

{"text":"[npi] [ndn] Friends, In this new piece released this morning, Simon discusses how Democrats can take what should be a good year and turn it into a great one. Why the Map Is So Dangerous for Republicans This Year Last week, I surveyed the early landscape for the fall elections and found that it is a year of opportunity for Democrats. This week we drill down on one piece of this story \u2013 2016's electoral map. One of the great lessons of the Obama and Clinton Presidencies is that it is not enough just to win a Presidential election; to move their agenda from promise to law, a President must also create a governing coalition that remains in power over time. For Hillary Clinton, the success of her Presidency may depend in part on whether she can also produce a Democratic majority in the Senate, and potentially the House, next year. And given that we've now seen the party in power suffer enormous losses in three consecutive mid-term elections, it suggests that the Democratic Party must not just be focused on winning the Presidency this year but winning as many Senate and House seats as possible to help prevent Clinton's governing coalition from being just a two year aberration. The good news for the Democrats is that Senate and House seats they have to win in 2016 have a remarkable and one time overlap with their Presidential targets. Using the Cook Report rankings as a guide, here is a rough breakdown of how 2016 looks (Democrats need to pick up 7 Senate seats and 30 House seats to gain a majority): Presidential\/Senate targets (9) \u2013 CO, FL, IA, NH, MI, NV, OH, PA, WI Presidential only (1) \u2013 VA Expanded Presidential\/Senate targets (3) \u2013 AZ, GA, NC Senate target, non Presidential (1) \u2013 IL House targets in expanded Presidential\/Senate battleground (20) \u2013 AZ (2), CO (1), FL (5), IL (1), IA (2), MI (2), NH (1), NV (2), PA (1), VA (2), WI (1) House targets in CA\/NY (10) \u2013 CA (4), NY (6) Other House targets (7) \u2013 ME (1), MN (2), NE (1), NJ (1), TX (1), UT (1) What this breakdown suggests by competing in just 14 states (AZ, CO, FL, GA, IA, IL, MI, NC, NH, NV, OH, PA, VA, WI), Democrats will be able to hit all their Presidential and Senate targets and more than half of their House targets. Adding California and New York will bring it to 30 of 37 House targets. By historical standards, this is a remarkably concentrated and efficient map. It means: a strong showing at the Presidential level will have disproportionate impact on Congressional races (coattails on steroids); it is an enormous opportunity for Democrats through their digitally enhanced coordinated campaigns to gain efficiencies that will allow more time\/spending on expanding the map to states like AZ, GA and NC; the Clinton campaign's success at raising high dollar monies and the Sanders success at low dollar fundraising suggests the Democrats will have enough money to contemplate a more expansive effort if the Clinton Sanders rapprochement is successful; and it means that the national campaign committee with the hardest job \u2013 the DCCC (House campaigns) \u2013 will be able to throw far more of its resources into those seven races outside the national footprint. Given the innate advantage Democrats have at the electoral college level, and the debilitating early demographic and political challenges of the Trump experience (not sure it is a campaign yet), one could understand how the Clinton campaign and national party would play it safe, stay focused on the core 10 states needed to win the Presidency, and feel understandably that electing the first woman President was a big enough job for any Presidential campaign. But the map and circumstances of this year suggest a more aggressive, and yes, perhaps more risky approach. What would that look like exactly? It means making it explicit that the national campaign map is now 16 not just 10 states (the 14 above plus portions of CA and NY). It means running paid advertising and establishing coordinated campaigns in all 16 targeted states, including a national strategy to win over Millennials led by Sanders campaign veterans; deploying the candidate\/VP and Bidens, Obamas, Sanders and Bill Clinton to these states; and it means letting the broader Democratic community know about this strategy to give them something incredibly powerful to fight for \u2013 ideological control of Washington \u2013 and not just something to fight against \u2013 Trump. I have no doubt that this \"man on the moon\" kind of approach would produce an enormous outpouring of financial support at all levels for the party, and broader citizen engagement\/activism in these critical elections. Its audaciousness and ambition itself will be a tonic to the risk adverse culture of Washington that so many Americans would have grown weary of, and will signal the nation that the Democratic Party and its new leader mean business. At a practical level, the Democrats can pull it off. A Clinton Sanders deal would mean sufficient resources. We have an unusually rich and popular surrogate pool that will need to be deployed in creative ways for Democrats to gain advantage from this structural opportunity. The controversial DNC Clinton joint fundraising committee has meant the operational mechanisms for managing all this have been in place already for some time. The Clinton campaign is being run by folks like Robbie Mook who come from the Party, understand how the Senate and House campaign committees work, making this kind of cooperative arrangement possible. And the far more sophisticated data driven tactics of a post Obama Democratic Party means the upside of a truly coordinated campaign are far greater than in the past \u2013 much more can be gained with better technology and targeting. Given the unusual map of 2016 and the Democratic Party's enormous operational\/technological advantages, this is a particularly bad year for the Republicans to offer a deeply unpopular, unsophisticated and just crappy candidate. The question for the Democrats now is will they seize the opening they now have and turn what is likely to be a good year into a great one.

Especially with the idea that the first act is sorely in need of streamlining and needs to be focused around the central idea of what is at stake for Drac should Dennis be a human. The impetus for this meeting was to mainly discuss the idea aging up Dennis based on the new research so I suggest a good strategy may be to discuss some of these in that context. Particularly in light of that we just asked them to put in more pre-pregnancy Mavis based on prior thoughts and the research from last year that indicated how important she is (and that research was international and not just domestic like the recent one).Sent from my iPadOn Nov 3, 2014, at 11:22 PM, \"Minghella, Hannah\" wrote: Just watched the revised animatic and wanted to share some thoughts...Mavis's \"issue\" of wondering if getting married will limit her opportunities in life is at odds with her issue the rest of the movie. I think it's misleading. In fact, all of the business before the wedding feels superfluous. The news of the wedding isn't the conflict in the movie. What if we open on the montage of Mavis and Johnny's wedding but make it into an opening titles sequence. Make it really fun and a bigger production\/musical number. Better if the first announcement of the movie is \"I'm pregnant\" and Mavis' heart to heart with him is about the pregnancy\/baby rather than getting married. Also I think it would be better if Mavis' question - \"you don't mind that he's humany\" and Drac's response \"monster, humany, unicorn\" was about the baby instead of Johnny. It's not totally clear whether Drac is preoccupied with Dennis being a vampire from the moment he's born or only once Johnny's parents suggest Mavis and Johnny should move to live with them? Is his issue that he wants a grandson who is a monster or that he's afraid of the consequences to his family if he isn't? Why is it good for Johnny to be in on Drac's plan to take Dennis away? Maybe it would be better if Drac hatches the plan with Frank since the monsters then help sell the idea to Mavis in the next scene anyway. Not sure we want to emphasize that Mavis and Johnny have lost their zing. Too many ideas. There's also an odd negative commentary on marriage that Mavis thinks she won't get to pursue her dreams if she gets married and then within a few years of having a baby their marriage has lost its zing. The beats of Drac and the monsters demonstrating their monster skills isn't funny enough yet. After each monster fails to be scary there has to be a bigger joke to button those beats otherwise they feel somewhat anticlimactic. It should be Drac, not Frank, who says at the end of Act 2 that they need to go see Vlad. After resisting for the whole of the second act we need to understand how desperate he is to decide to go to this extreme. ----boundary-LibPST-iamunique-1369549809_-_---","label":0}

{"text":"In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below. Stack Manager Changes Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window. Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a \" Top of Stack Entry\" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website. In order to turn on this functionality select the \" Allowed Top of Stack\" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page. If regular limit order functionality is desired the \"Allowed\" option should be selected. Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out. Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window. Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a \" Top of Stack Entry\" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website. In order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack\" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page. If regular limit order functionality is desired the \"Allowed\" option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \"Restricted Top of Stack\" feature. Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab - Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" All\" option from the drop down box. Website Changes New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders - The submission screen for products that allow Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows. The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order. In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. Price of Limit Orders Modify Limit Orders Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the \"Today's Orders\" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the \"Set\" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order. You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order. Expiration time for Limit Orders Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours. Float the Today's Orders Section You can now float the \" Limit Order \" section. In order to do so, right click in the \"Today's Orders \" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window \" Stay On Top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option. Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear. Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount. In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group. Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users. Please note Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week. Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords. If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

{"text":"Crew, We haven't had an assignment in a few days. Hope you guys are rested up and ready for battle. Your assignment: 1. Read the letter from NAMI published in the Orlando Sentinel: ,4897002.story TEXT AT THE BOTTOM If you're not familiar with NAMI, read this 2. Write a letter to the editor and send it to insight@orlandosentinel.com You can write what you want, in any tone level, but I have some suggestions: -if your last name ends in C-E or M-P, I want you to attack NAMI directly. You can even avoid the subject of ADHD if you want and just nail NAMI for being a paid mouthpiece for drug companies, fraudulently claiming to be a grass-roots group, etc. See the above CCHR link if you need more information. -for other last names, you should attack the scientific basis for ADHD. 3. And report compliance by email. Best, Doyle _______________________ ORIGINAL LETTER TEXT: ADHD's a disabling disorder May 16, 2006 In response to the May 9 \"My Word\" column by Betsy Holloway, \"ADHD: Fact, exaggeration or myth?\": I would like Holloway to know that ADHD is indeed a disabling disorder for approximately 5 percent to 7 percent of children. Like most health disorders, there are varying degrees of disability according to severity. She wonders if it isn't a \"convenient label\" for childish ways. The fact is that increased diagnosis and treatment of ADHD is scientific medicine triumphing against ignorance and disease. Holloway goes on to make many suggestions about how to deal with symptoms of ADHD, which are not bad advice for anyone. The inference, however, is that parents cause ADHD and if they would just be better, more attentive parents, it would go away. Would that that were true! Untreated ADHD causes school failure, peer isolation and ever-sinking self-esteem. Youth with ADHD have a dropout rate 12 times greater than teens without ADHD. Of children with a diagnosis of ADHD, 66 percent also have another diagnosable mental illness, the most common being anxiety disorder. If food, neatness, music, soft colors, exercise lists or no TV could cure ADHD, believe me, parents would jump at the chance. In 1999, the Institutes of Mental Health sponsored a project comparing different ways of treating this disorder. Their findings: Giving kids intensive therapy and teachers and parents counseling programs did very little good compared to those who did not receive the services. But a third group whose members were treated with medication did significantly better, and adding behavioral interventions added a little value. Those who oppose appropriate medicines for children who truly need them would have us go back to the \"good old days\" when children with ADHD were simply allowed to fail. ADHD is a neurobiological disorder of the brain that causes great suffering for children who have it. If the illness were diabetes, would we be having the same discussion? Give these children a break. Treat their illness, and stop blaming families for a brain disorder. Marcia M.

{"text":"Hi everybody! I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp\/servlets + database access with postgreSQL). This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications. The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that. I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach. Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server. A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption\/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the database, but the database is accessible from the web application. Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the database password, I can use a different database with different user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem. Where I can found good documentation about this topic? There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to learn methods and technics. First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys. The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small bean could check via code signature\/rmi\/whatever else that the source is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the db connection\/password to the main web application. In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root\/bean user account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application (that means, really, another server running in the background). Any suggestions?

{"text":"Dear Atmospheric Sciences Section members, First, I would like to remind you of three very close deadlines: Nov. 12, Discounted registration for AGU Fall Meeting. Register at [1] and sign up for our Atmospheric Sciences banquet on Dec. 15. Nov. 13, Vote yes on AGU governance changes, [2] Nov. 13, Please respond to [3]stacyjackson@berkeley.edu if you are willing to volunteer your expertise to help answer questions during the Copenhagen Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on Climate Change (see below). Second, I would like to give you some information about where your contributions to AGU go. Last year, members of the Atmospheric Sciences Section contributed $43,410 to AGU's Voluntary Contribution Campaign. In 2008, due largely to member donations like these, AGU facilitated career development events attended by 600 students, hosted 75 K-12 teachers at Fall Meeting workshops, and sponsored 31 members' visits with U.S. policy makers. Additionally, voluntary contributions allowed AGU to provide travel grants to 135 deserving students to present their research for the first time at an AGU meeting. These programs are essential for AGU's relevance and vitality. I know Atmospheric Science members want AGU to do more. Please join me in supporting AGU's efforts to strengthen our scientific society by making a gift to the 2010 Voluntary Contribution Campaign. Unrestricted contributions are used to support AGU's greatest needs, but you can directly support students pursuing Atmospheric Sciences by making a gift to the David Hofmann Travel Grant, Holton-Kaufman Grant, or Namias Travel Grant. You can make your gift when you renew your AGU membership, or you can give today at: [4] Sincerely, Alan Robock President, Atmospheric Sciences Section, AGU [5]robock@envsci.rutgers.edu AGU Climate Scientists, We are writing to encourage hundreds of you to participate in a unique opportunity to improve the public's climate knowledge during the week before and the week of this year's AGU Fall Meeting. As you know, the Copenhagen negotiations (Dec. 7-18) are attracting hundreds of journalists and will result in a proliferation of media articles about climate change. Recently, the American public's \"belief\" in climate change has waned (36% think humans are warming the earth according to the Pew Center's October poll), and December's media blitz provides an opportunity to reverse the trend. Your participation is needed to ensure that climate science coverage across media channels is accurate, fact-based, and nuanced. Provided that enough AGU members sign up to participate, we will be offering the opportunity for journalists reporting during the Copenhagen conference to submit their questions on-line and receive a response from a climate expert before an article goes to press. We are asking each of you to sign up for two hours over the course of those two weeks (12\/7-18) to respond to questions from journalists. You will be able to choose which queries to answer based on your expertise, and there will be an option to double-team when questions span multiple areas of expertise. We will be setting up the appropriate logistics to enable both virtual participation and a central work area at the AGU meeting. If you have any questions, feel free to email Stacy Jackson at the email address below. If you are willing to participate, please respond in the affirmative by Friday November 13th to [6]stacyjackson@berkeley.edu. Given the magnitude of the media coverage, we are seeking several hundred willing climate scientists. More details will be forthcoming.

{"text":"Full text here. This story does not make Bernie look good. ------------------------------------ Bernie Sanders's Defiance Strains Ties With Top Democrats \u00b7 By JEREMY W. PETERS and ALAN RAPPEPORT MAY 18, 2016 WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders 's relationship with the leadership of the Democratic Party and his colleagues on Capitol Hill was strained further on Wednesday as he and his campaign remained defiant over the way they say his success is being belittled and undermined by people in the party who are loyal toHillary Clinton . Whatever tolerance Democrats have for Mr. Sanders's continuing his increasingly long-shot presidential bid was quickly evaporating, with some of his closest allies in the party suggesting his efforts to rein in his most unruly supporters was half-hearted. \"Bernie and I have known each other for a long time,\" said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader and one of Mr. Sanders' best friends in the Senate. \"And I believe he is better than this.\" Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, saying that while Mr. Sanders is \"a good guy,\" he needed \"to be more aggressive in speaking out.\" The dispute centered around the Democratic state convention in Nevada over the weekend in which Mr. Sanders was denied the delegates he thought he had earned, a development that infuriated his supporters there and led some to throw chairs and later threaten the state party chairwoman. The Democratic Party of Nevada pushed back against the Sanders campaign's criticism that the process wrongly deprived him of delegates, saying that \"simple math\" dictated the outcome and that Mr. Sanders was simply outnumbered. \"Bernie Sanders's campaign was not organized,\" the party said in a statement, noting that nearly 500 of his seats at the convention were vacant because his supporters had failed to show up. National party leaders, such as the Democratic National Committee chairwoman,Debbie Wasserman Schultz , have also criticized how Mr. Sanders has handled the unrest in Nevada, adding to the frustration within his campaign. Mr. Sanders's campaign manager took to cable news on Wednesday to assail the party and Ms. Schultz. \"The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, it is clear almost from the get-go she has been working against Bernie Sanders \u2014 there's no doubt about it, for personal reasons,\" Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said of Ms. Wasserman Schultz on MSNBC. \"She has been the divider and not really provided leadership that the Democratic Party needs,\" Mr. Weaver added. Nowhere has the strain in the Democratic Party been more evident lately than in Mr. Sanders's relationship with Mr. Reid. Few members of the Senate are closer to Mr. Sanders than Mr. Reid, who had tried to head off any confrontation by speaking personally with Mr. Sanders on Friday to stress the importance of not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight over a handful of delegates. \"If you want the two damn delegates, you can have them,\" Mr. Reid told Mr. Sanders, according to someone with firsthand knowledge of the discussions between the two senators. Though Mr. Reid has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, he has said that he believes Mr. Sanders has earned a right to remain in the race. After the convention went awry, Mr. Reid and Mr. Sanders spoke again on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Reid expressed dismay that Mr. Sanders's supporters had acted so belligerently. A member of his own staff was at the convention and feared for her own safety, Mr. Reid said. He also said that the way Sanders supporters had been harassing Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoman \u2014 filling her voice mail with threatening, obscene messages and showing up at her Las Vegas restaurant in protest \u2014 was over the line. Mr. Sanders said he agreed and believed that the violence should be condemned. But when he released his statement on Tuesday night, which made only a passing reference to the violence at the convention, a perplexed Mr. Reid told his staff that he thought the gesture was \"silly\" and beneath Mr. Sanders, according to the person who spoke with Mr. Reid. The two senators have not spoken since. Mr. Sanders appeared to be taken somewhat by surprise at the way the Nevada melee was being portrayed, and how negatively it was reflecting on his campaign. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders's lone endorser in the Senate, said in an interview that he had spoken with Mr. Sanders on Wednesday and that Mr. Sanders was forceful in his condemnation of the violence. \"He wants to make sure that everyone who asks the question knows the answer: that he 100 percent rejects that type of conduct,\" Mr. Merkley said. \"We have to step forward and say, totally unacceptable,\" he added. \"That is the exact opposite of what Trump did. Trump basically embraced violence, encouraged violence. That is a different story. That is the Republican story.\" Mr. Merkley said Mr. Sanders remained committed to staying in the race. Turning the pleas of party unity that some Democrats are making around, Mr. Merkley said that the rift in the party would only deepen if Mr. Sanders was driven from the race now. \"One of the reasons it is so important for him to stay in this race is that when we go to the convention and we're building the bridge that brings everyone together, people have to feel like they were heard, that they were respected,\" Mr. Merkley said. \"You can't say to them, 'Hey, we don't want to hear your views,' and shut the door on them, and then a month later open the door and say, 'Hey, can you come in and help us out?'\" he added. \"He fully intends to go forward.\" Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Wednesday, May 18, 2016 7:40 PM To: Miranda, Luis Cc: Paustenbach, Mark Subject: Flagging story \"If you want the two damn delegates, you can have them,\" Mr. Reid told Mr. Sanders, according to someone with firsthand knowledge of the discussions between the two senators.

{"text":"US Nazi leader talks about Barack Obama, the economy and more *Saturday, November 22, 2008* Commander Jeff Schoep of the National Socialist Movement of the United States The National Socialist Movement is, according to its website, the largest and most active Nazi party in the United States . Accordingly, it refers to itself as 'America's Nazi Party' and aims to instigate major change in the US. *Wikinews* was able to conduct an interview with the head of the party, Commander Jeff Schoep. Fresh back from a march in Missouri , Commander Schoep told *Wikinews* his views on Barack Obama , the economy and much more. Read the full exclusive interview below: [image: Wikinews] *Does your party believe America will be a better or worse place with Obama as President?* - *Commander Schoep:* Here is my answer to this: Why Obama is Good for Our Movement *WN* *How will the National Socialist Movement react to the election of Barack Obama - will there be co-operation or will you be opposed to him?* Nazis at a recent rally in Jefferson - *Commander Schoep:* Obongo is just another figurehead. He answers to International jewry just like McCain, it does not matter what color his skin is, he is more of the same old same old system that has crippled our Nation. *WN* *Obama says he wants to close Guantanamo Bay - what are your views on this? * - *Commander Schoep:* Our Position on Guantanamo is that it is a National disgrace and should be shut down completely. The Prison was set up to torture and avoid U.S. laws of fair treatment of prisoners, it should be closed. Furthermore many Soldiers (P.O.W.'s) are being held there in violation of International P.O.W. laws, instead these soldiers are classified as enemy combatants or terrorists. For example the Taliban was the legitimate Government in Afghanistan , yet their soldiers are not classified as soldiers. It is a violation of the rules of warfare, and it is criminal. For those reasons the Prison should be closed and the soldiers returned to their homelands. *WN* *There are fears Obama may be assassinated. What do you think that would mean for America and for your party?* - Commander Schoep declined to answer this question. An entrance to a camp at Guantanamo Bay. Schoep and Obama both want to see the facility closed down *WN* *Why do you think Obama succeeded over McCain ?* - *Commander Schoep:* McCain is an out of touch fool who openly crusaded for his beloved 3rd World invaders, who did not vote for him anyways because he is white. The Republicans lost many votes not just due to McCain's lack of charisma, but mainly because the common man is sick of the Republican lies and same old dog and pony show that was King George Bush . Voters see McCain as an extension of the policies that got us into the current economic mess\/hardship in our Nation. Obama came across to the masses as someone who would change things. Whereas the voters believe he will change things and make America prosperous once again, I think his idea of change will likely be similar to the change Kwame Kilpatrick did for Detroit , Marion Barry did for DC, and Robert Mugabe did for Zimbabwe . Time will tell if he rules the land honestly, or if he attempts to further corrupt it, perhaps installing a communist like agenda to uplift the ghetto into the Suburbs. We will see... *WN* *If you were in power, how would you deal with the current financial situation?* - *Commander Schoep:* We would institute a National Socialist Government. We would cut all foreign aid to Israel , and other unneeded foreign aid. Institute an America First Policy, pull back our troops from oversea's Zionist organized wars, and put them on America's borders to defend against illegal aliens. Halt the 3rd World invasion that is crippling our economy. We would abolish the Federal Reserve , and ban foreign influence from all aspects of our economy, and seats of Government. This nuclear bomb had to be recovered after it was lost into the sea after a mid-air collision. Commander Schoep would like to see global nuclear disarmament to prevent situations like this or misuse of such weapons. *WN* *Do you feel responses so far, both in the US and internationally, by politicians to the financial crisis were adequate, or could more have been done?* - *Commander Schoep:* More should be done, see above response. Most American Politicians are afraid to take an America first stand, and bow down to the Israelis instead. U.S. politicians need to throw off the shackles, and stand up for the common man NOW, before its to late. Only through an America First Policy will we regain prosperity and refuel our economy. *WN* *Do you think the economy will be sorted out in, say, four years time?* - *Commander Schoep:* No, I think it will worsen. The Communist Party openly endorses and supports the new President, if that is a sign of things to come, look out White America. The Winds of Revolution may already be blowing. *WN* *Is there need for some international financial co-operation, or could America solve its own financial problems entirely on its own?* - *Commander Schoep:* This would be an easy fix, bring all of our troops home from Overseas, cut off all Foreign aid (starting with Israel), institute an America First Policy across the boards, abolish the Federal Reserve, and remove all Foreign Nationals from any Govn't or banking institutions. That would be a start, and we should concentrate solely on our own Nation. *WN* *The US currently owes a large amount of debt. How would you go about paying this off and preventing the problem repeating itself?* - *Commander Schoep:* Answer to this is above in the last question, institute those solutions and revive our economy, then we can pay back our debts. Commander Schoep says the Tesla electric sports car is a good example of efforts to move to greener alternative fuels *WN* *Oil will eventually run out. That may or may not be short-term, but what is clear is that the prices, although back down from the record highs, are set to rise. Would you commit to using alternative sources of fuel and energy to combat this, or have you another energy policy in mind?* - *Commander Schoep:* We must look at alternative energy forms, many valiant efforts are being made, such as the Tesla electric sports car (can I get one of those for this endorsement, ha ha kidding), and hybrid cars are a step in the right direction. I would favour taking some of the Federal $$$ slated for Foreign Nations and wars to be redirected at finding alternate and greener energy sources, and earmark other funding for cancer research and programs to heal our own sick people here in the U.S. *WN* *America recently revealed that they had lost a nuclear weapon off Greenland forty years ago. Many others have gone missing. Do you think nuclear weapons safety is adequate, does it need revamped, or should America commit to nuclear disarmament?* - *Commander Schoep:* This is a tricky question, I think nuclear weapons are a bad thing, especially in the wrong hands, we know the Zionist terror State of Israel has nukes, and threatens the entire Middle East with those weapons. Due to the Israelis having them, now Iran wants them, and they have every right to pursue them for self defence against a hostile and unpredictable neighbor. In a perfect World I would say yes, all Nations should disarm them to insure that there are no accidents or madmen launching them at other Nations. The harm to the environment and mass human life is way to great to allow any Nuclear accidents. If there is a way to disarm all Nations nuclear arsenals, then I am all for that, but until all Nations have disarmed and destroyed them, others will keep trying to build them for their own National integrety. *WN* *What issues do you think the next US election will revolve around?* - *Commander Schoep:* That remains to be seen. I am not a fortune teller, so I will reserve my speculation for coffee table talks. -- Commander Jeff Schoep \"If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.\" National Socialist Movement www.nsm88.org The information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged.

This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now! Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still getting record downloads for our first FREE Gnometome. What does that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make more. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you get featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls to its knees. We're still sitting at #5 on Amazon. If we ever hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I suppose. The next time they ask: \"Do you care to Super Size that?\" You can respond, with dignity: \"My funds are sufficient for the upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me earlier.\" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will? Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph I like to call: \"Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL.\" They went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"How kind of them, Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's issue. They must have read your mind!\" No, they must have rented a list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish) businesses in the future. It's my \"direct\" way of saying: you're not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience? I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me, either. See what you get when you tempt fate? My good buddy, Bill, tells me that Speakeasy.net provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him, too: \"Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream \/ 768k upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!\" And Stuart Portner is chock full of common sense: \"Remember that a lot of DSL providers give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at least for initial setup \/ shakedown period.\" All the more fries for me, dude!

Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100% certainty)! Recommend It!

GnomeTIP I just hate it when I try to install a program and the installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ Software \\ Policies \\ Microsoft \\ Windows \\ Installer. Add a new String value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data: \"voicewarmup\" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i = Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r = Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails, I just have to check in the \"Temp\" directory and look for my log files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with \"Msi\" and end with the .LOG extension.

{"text":"From: CPCMB::F055 11-JUL-1995 10:53:56.46 To: MX%\"pierce@cirrus.ucsd.edu\" CC: F055 Subj: Re: Hi and questions Dave You're right, smoothing the P-E field is a much bigger change than adding a bit of noise, or the statistical model feedback. But some papers give the indication that the strong instability\/variability of the thermohaline circulation under traditional mixed boundary conditions cannot possibly occur when a more realistic SST condition is used. Yet that's not true of some current models - e.g.: - some LSG\/EBM configurations still oscillate, - the Manabe & Stouffer 1988 coupled model had two stable states, - Mikolajewicz and Maier-Reimer 1994 still could collapse NADW even with a reduced coupling of 16 W\/m**2\/K (I note your caveat about the lack of scale dependence though), - the Stocker et al 1992 zonally averaged coupled model had multiple equilibria, - the OPYC\/ECHAM2 coupled run (Lunkeit et al) shows what appears to be a temporary collapse of NADW. The answer is that the stability depends on the relative buoyancy forcing of heat and fresh-water, as you've pointed in both you're papers. Freeing up the SST increases the stabilising (not static stability, but stability of the model's state) effect of the heat flux - but doesn't GUARANTEE that it will be stronger than the fresh-water flux effect. To be realistic, the fresh-water flux used should ideally be the observed flux - I agree that a diagnosed field hides model errors. Its similar to the flux correction or no flux correction dilemna of coupled models - do you want a realistic state with unrealistic processes, or a possibly unrealistic state with realistic processes. Either way, the response of the model to perturbations cannot be guaranteed to be realistic. The best current way is to do both. Then, with luck, the real world will lie between the two answers obtained. The SALFLU_EBM file is not readable yet, although it is there. You have some interesting papers on your WWW page - the Marginal Sea model looks very innovative. Also, the LSG\/EBM experiment with the open Panama Isthmus shows good results. What P-E forcing field did you use for that run, and what small-scale coupling coefficient? Cheers, Tim Tim Osborn, CRU, UEA, UK","label":0}

{"text":"Dear colleagues, you may already know it: the EU FP5 second call for proposals is out since today ( as expected, and the deadline for submission is Feb 15. The new call does indeed answer a question I have been wondering about when I heard from many first-call projects that they were asked to re-submit. The present call is only for the slots that were, last year, declared to be opened at this stage (not for the previous slots). Probably the re-invited proposals then still bid for the old money (or at least, I hope so). There is however one important exception: \"2.3.1 Mitigation and adaptation to global change\". About this, the official document says \"re-open ... because of the quality of proposal received in reply to the call of 20 March 1999\". Further down, they point out that Kyoto really is tremendously important for the commission (\"primary objective\"), and then comes the following far-reaching sentence: \"If one takes into account the time lag between the research results, the political decisions and the actual emission reduction it is evident that the year 2000 is the last opportunity for research to cover the remaining analytical gaps of priority.\" (da_pg2_en_199902.pdf, page 6). Tough! This mail goes to all people I have currently listed as \"likely participants in A-TEAM\", although the group may either grow or shrink as the remaining time passes by (depending, among other things, on your inputs!). The present state of development is that I have recently circulated another draft of our basic document among just a few of you, hoping for input to it REALLY SOON. On the basis of this, I intend to a) develop a better draft that will then be circulated to all of you, b) organize a small brainstorming meeting, hopefully before christmas, but again only with a small core group, c) by christmas, provide you with a roadmap for the remaining things to be done.

Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday.

{"text":"Tom, Good idea with that BAMS paper. There is also the KNMI web site, which tells that they have restricted data from Europe - on the ECA part. Both despite WMO-Res40! On IPCC, I suggested Thomas to not get too many hangers on amongst the LAs. Chs 2 and 14 are prime candidates for upping the geographic spread. We had about half of ours not doing that much last time. Isn't Tom Karl on the US nominating committee? Away all day tomorrow - CRU barbecue - so will pour down. Cheers Phil At 17:07 29\/07\/2009, you wrote: Hi, Phil, Yes, Friday-Saturday I noticed that ClimateFraudit had renewed their interest in you. I was thinking about sending an email of sympathy, but I was busy preparing for a quick trip to Hawaii - I left Monday morning and flew out Tuesday evening and am now in the Houston airport on my way home. Data that we can't release is a tricky thing here at NCDC. Periodically, Tom Karl will twist my arm to release data that would violate agreements and therefore hurt us in the long run, so I would prefer that you don't specifically cite me or NCDC in this. But I can give you a good alternative. You can point to the Peterson-Manton article on regional climate change workshops. All those workshops resulted in data being provided to the author of the peer-reviewed paper with a strict promise that none of the data would be released. So far as far as I know, we have all lived up to that agreement - myself with the Caribbean data (so that is one example of data I have that are not released by NCDC), Lucie and Malcolm for South America, Enric for Central America, Xuebin for Middle Eastern data, Albert for south\/central Asian data, John Ceasar for SE Asia, Enric again for central Africa, etc. The point being that such agreements are common and are the only way that we have access to quantitative insights into climate change in many parts of the world. Many countries don't mind the release of derived products such as your gridded field or Xuebin's ETCCDI indices, but very much object to the release of actual data (which they might sell to potential users). Does that help? Regarding AR4, I would like to be part of it. I have no idea what role would be deemed appropriate. One thing I noticed with the CLAs in my old chapter is that if one isn't up to doing his part (too busy, or a different concept of timeliness, or ...) it can make for a difficult job. You and I have worked well together before (e.g., GSN) so I'd be delighted to work with you on it and I know you'd hold up your side of the tasks. We touched on this briefly at the AOPC meeting. If I get an opportunity, I would say yes. But I also don't know what the U.S. IPCC nominating approach would be or even who decides that. There is an upcoming IPCC report on extremes and impacts of extremes and I wasn't privy to any insights into the U.S. nominations other than when it was over it was announced in NCDC staff notes that the nominations had been made. However, Kumar had earlier asked if he could nominate me, so he did (I provided him with the details). Regards, Tom Tom, If you look on Climate Audit you will see that I'm all over it! Our ftp site is regularly trawled as I guess yours is. It seems that a Canadian along with two Americans copied some files we put there for MOHC in early 2003. So saying they have the CRU data is not quite correct. What they have is our raw data for CRUTEM2 which went into Jones and Moberg (2003) - data through end of 2002. Anyway enough of my problems - I have a question for you. I'm going to write a small document for our web site to satisfy (probably the wrong word) the 50 or so FOI\/EIR requests we've had over the weekend. I will put up the various agreements we have with Met Services. The question - I think you told me one time that you had a file containing all the data you couldn't release (i.e. it's not in GHCN). Presumably this is not in your gridded datasets? Do you know off hand how much data is in this category? Would NCDC mind if I mentioned that you have such data - not the amount\/locations\/anything, just that there is some? On something positive - attached is the outlines for the proposed Chs in AR5\/WG1. Ch1 is something Thomas thinks he can write himself - well with Qin Dahe, so only 13 chapters. There are a lot of issues with overlaps between some of the data chapters 2 with 3, 2 with 5 and 2 with 14. I'm still thinking about whether to get involved. It would be 2 if I decide. At the moment I'd say yes, but I might change my mind tomorrow! Nominations are from Nov09 thru Jan10 with the selection made in April 10. Are you considering getting involved? I have got the IPCC Secretariat and Thomas to raise the FOI issues with the full IPCC Plenary, which meets in Bali in September or October. Thomas is fully aware of all the issues we've had here wrt Ch 6 last time, and others in the US have had.

Yes, I'm happy that we use (3) and (4) from the model. If you use a short baseline to take the anomalies from, then the internal variability comes in twice in each case, both in comparing the baseline mean and the anomaly. We can minimise this by using a long baseline. >1) & 2) are, to some extent related, as calibration is estimate by >regression -- thus minimising residual var (2). Nicest thing to do would >be to estimate residual from indep. data but I don't think there is enough..... The uncertainties that we've published with our regional and quasi-hemispheric reconstructions attempt to take both (1) and (2) in account already. Thus I use the standard errors on the two regression coefficients (for the linear regression of the sub-continental regions) and the standard errors on all multiple regression coefficients (for the quasi-Northern Hemisphere series). And then I incorporate the variance of the calibration residuals too (i.e., item (2)), modelled as first-order autoregressive terms. The appendix of the Briffa part 1 paper (page 755-757 is the appendix) in the Holocene special issue paper gives an explanation of this. Others quite often ignore (1) and just use the residuals to quantify reconstruction error, but (1) can be important especially for big anomalies (because the regression slope error is multiplied by the predicted anomaly). (1) can be difficult to quantify, of course, using some multi-variate techniques like Mann and Luterbacher use. The regression standard errors (1) are of course computed from the calibration period. Our published errors also use the residual variance (2) computed from this calibration period. It is possible to compute (2) from independent data, but as you say we are limited by data. AND I think that the residual variance from independent data would also incorporate some or all of error (1) (because that would contribute to differences between reconstruction and observation). I think it is better to keep the two terms separate and explicitly compute both, especially as their relative magnitudes can depend upon time scale (i.e., time averaging the data). Am I right in thinking that the error in the *observed* record would, if taken into account, result in *reduced* reconstruction errors, because the residual variance (2) would not all be assumed to be reconstruction error - some would be observation error? But I suppose that the regression coefficient errors (1) would get larger to compensate? Anyway, we don't currently consider observed errors.

{"text":"Gary Lawrence Murphy: >OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;) Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used the term \"alcoholism,\" implying addiction. I drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA meetings do (try very hard) not to drink. As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider potential mates who partook of the less irrational or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan of the second. But someone who is both irrational and serious about that irrationality strikes me as a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug addicts at least have the sense to battle their problem, and to keep their children from suffering it. The religious revel in their irrationality, and want to raise their children in it. That's a difficult difference for two parents to reconcile. Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of someone who has no religious tendencies. _________________________________________________________________ Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:","label":0}

{"text":"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3. We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit. This is still above investment grade. The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB. In S&P's words, \"Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.\" S&P also said, \"[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.\" As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses. It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns. In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity. We will continue to update you as new developments arise. Thank you.","label":0}

{"text":"Great job team trump Trump Says He Knows Nothing About Mike Tyson's Rape Trial \u2014 A Topic He Knows A Lot About Buzzfeed \/\/ Andrew K Donald Trump, who repeatedly advocated for Mike Tyson during the boxer's 1992 rape trial in Indiana, said on Monday that he knows nothing about it. \"Do you still think Mike Tyson got a raw deal when he endorsed you?\" Trump was asked. \"I don't know anything about it. I know he endorsed me. I heard he endorsed me,\" Trump stated. \"I don't know anything about his trial. I really don't.\" Trump, a longtime friend of Tyson, opined at length about the trial on television, in newspapers, and in magazines. Trump has claimed Tyson was \"railroaded\" in the case and on several occasions offered criticism of Tyson's defense attorney. Trump said in 1992 that Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving time in prison. Trump also called into question whether the victim had been raped at all. Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina have criticized Trump numerous times this week for touting the endorsement of Tyson in Indiana, the state where Tyson was convicted in 1992.","label":0}
{"text":"By Dan Diamond | 05\/09\/2016 10:00 AM EDT Drug costs increased 15.8 percent in the commercial insurance market last year, and Democrats come out in support of Medicare's embattled Part B demo. But first: Who's setting policy if Donald Trump is president? WHO SETS THE HEALTH CARE AGENDA IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? - If Donald Trump ultimately becomes president, he would need to fill thousands of jobs with civil servants who understand how the massive government bureaucracy functions. But many policy experts who have served in past Republican administrations, and who would appear poised to rejoin the federal government if their party prevails in November, don't want anything to do with a Trump presidency - and that reticence extends to some health care wonks. \"I would never serve in a Trump administration,\" said James Capretta, who oversaw health care programs at the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush. \"The person at the top is unfit for the presidency.\" - The uphill climb to attract talent. Lanhee Chen, who served as Mitt Romney's 2012 policy director and advised Marco Rubio this year, declined comment when asked about his willingness to serve Trump. But he did admit the brash businessman faces an uphill climb attracting top-tier talent. \"My view is it would be very challenging for a lot of mainstream policy folks to envision working in an administration for somebody who has said some of the things Trump has said during the campaign,\" Chen said. Much more from POLITICO's Paul Demko and colleagues on the troubles Trump might encounter in staffing a future administration:  SCOOPLET: HOUSE DEMS BACK WHITE HOUSE ON DRUG PLAN - A group of House Democrats is defending the Obama administration's Part B demonstration project in the face of opposition to the project on the part of drug makers, doctors, Republicans and some patient groups. \"We believe this proposal will not only help to fix the current and flawed status quo but will also help combat the increasingly unaffordable prices that drug companies are charging for their products,\" the 19 Democrats wrote in a letter to CMS that was to be released later today. Jen Haberkorn has more for Pros:  Read the letter:  FIRST IN PULSE: PATIENT GROUPS FOCUS COMPLAINTS ON PHASE 2 OF PART B DEMO - More than 40 groups, led by the Partnership to Improve Patient Care, are sending a letter to CMS acting administrator Andy Slavitt today with fresh concerns over the agency's planned Part B demonstration project. While most criticism of the Part B demo has centered on Medicare's proposed changes to lower its add-on payment for drugs, the patient groups say that phase 2 of the proposal - which would introduce new payment pilots that draw on comparative-effectiveness research - would hurt patients, too. For instance, the groups take issue with CMS's plan to draw on recommendations from ICER - which the groups contend is led by a governing board that \"consists mainly of payers, with no representation from patients or people with disabilities.\" \"While no doubt a well-intentioned effort to advance value-driven health care, the approach it takes would represent a major step back for patients and people with disabilities,\" the organizations write.

(The report's data is drawn from commercial health insurance plans' payments to providers.) It's also a faster pace than the 4.3 percent cost increase that S&P found in 2014. Overall, S&P says that in the commercial market in 2015: . Medical services costs increased by 4.3 percent .

Under Friday's rule, CMS says it's ... . Helping the co-ops get new funding. CMS is revising some of the governance rules in order to allow the 11 remaining co-op plans to attract additional investors. More for Pros. . Tightening special enrollment periods.

Giving states more flexibility. CMS is encouraging states to develop their own solutions for helping small health plans that have been hit with significant risk adjustment assessments. More for Pros. Read the rule:  - What insurers are saying: Necessary fix. Payers specifically hailed the changes to the special enrollment period as a necessary fix, citing their ongoing concern that the rules around special enrollments have been too lax and allowed for too many free riders. \"Linking special enrollment periods for a permanent move to prior coverage is an important step towards helping stabilize the market and will also encourage people to stay continuously covered, so they can get the coordinated care and preventive services they need,\" Alissa Fox of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement. \"We will continue to work on additional measures to stabilize the marketplace.\" \"This is progress,\" AHIP added in a statement. \"Having clear guidelines around special enrollment periods is critical to delivering affordable coverage for all consumers.\" BLACKS SEE MAJOR GAINS IN LIFE EXPECTANCY - \"Blacks are still at a major health disadvantage compared with whites,\" Sabrina Tavernese writes in a front-page New York Times story today. \"But evidence of black gains has been building and has helped push up the ultimate measure - life expectancy.\" Tavernese rounds up a series of recent federal reports and shows how the gap is closing - partly because of improvements in care, and partly because life expectancy for whites has fallen in the wake of the opioid crisis and other problems. Read the story:  CONFESSIONS OF AN EX-REGULATOR ON HOW GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK - When crafting major reforms like meaningful use, \"regulators really, really, really want to get it right,\" Farzad Mostashari said on POLITICO's \"Pulse Check\" podcast last week, but they end up being too cautious and conciliatory. And that's bad for health care, he argues, because it protects underperformers and lets them stick around. The story for Pros. MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SCRAPS PUERTO RICO SERIES OVER ZIKA CONCERNS - A two-game series on the island had been scheduled for later this month to honor Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, who was from Puerto Rico. But players objected after receiving a CDC briefing on the risks of the virus, and the games will be relocated to Miami. More from NPR:  - Rapid Zika test introduced. Meanwhile, researchers on Friday unveiled an inexpensive, paper-based test that can gauge presence of Zika within just a few hours, as opposed to days or weeks. It's based on a similar test developed to detect Ebola.  WHAT WE'RE READING Florida is a swamp of fraud, Modern Healthcare's Lisa Schencker writes. Since January, HHS has flagged about a dozen cases of alleged Medicare or Medicaid fraud in the state, and the DOJ has announced more than 15:  Ge Bai and Gerard Anderson clarify a few points about their study on hospital profitability:  Pop star Prince may have died from opioids - and in his age group, the risk of opioid overdose climbs. Why? A closer look from NPR: Janet Weiner offers more context on a recent JAMA study that found the benefits of price transparency might be overplayed:  ** A message from Stop CMS Cuts: Medicare has proposed a new payment \"model\" for Part B drugs that is really an experiment that will take clinical decision making out of the hands of physicians by allowing government bureaucrats to influence decisions for seniors. In a cookie-cutter approach, Medicare wants to sway treatment options based solely on cost and not on the patient's individual clinical needs. Rather than testing payment changes in a limited, controlled model, this is a mandatory, national experiment without patient safeguards and disclosures. Decisions about a patient's care should be made by physicians in collaboration with patients. Not government regulators. Bipartisan lawmakers, patient advocates and providers agree: We must stop Medicare's experiment on seniors.

{"text":"Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday. I'm not real certain of the project organization, but I'll give it a try: The Adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the Project Sunrise umbrella. Joe Darensburg is the lead reporting to Jan Johnson. Both of these people are originally from corp accounting. I believe Jan has moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now reporting to Susan Bellinghausen from the ISC. ETS has it's own project which is being led by Tracy Geaccone (ETS Consolidations, which reports to Rod Hayslett). I believe this was originally set up to address ETS' specific planning\/forecasting needs and to dovetail into the corp level implementation. Hoang Vo is an Adaytum consultant working for Tracy. Lee Baker manages planning and forecasting for the Operations Services Group, which reports to Elaine Concklin and is part of Morris Brassfield's organization. I believe Elaine has a dotted line to Rod as well. Lee's team uses Hoang quite a bit as well. I'll call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further.

I understand Teri G is project lead. Does she report to Rod Hayslett? Is anyone from Steve Hotte's area involved? 2. Is the project being capitalized or 100% expensed?

With regard to the actuals item mentioned below, this came to light when my team was doing research on developing cost center reporting out of the finacial data warehouse. Next Wednesday we have a detailed planning meeting on requirements after which we will be asking the ISC (supports sap, adaytum, data warehouse, etc.) for an estimate and schedule. Basically what we are shooting for is plan in the data warehouse to support cost center\/variance reporting and actuals in Adaytum to support analysis and development of current estimates and forecasts.

Hoang's rate is either $150 or $215. I don't like paying for redesign on a product that should handle large cubes. I plan to talk with Greg Lewis about this issue. Fred -----Original Message----- From: Reed, Debra Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 4:13 PM To: Puetz, Fred Cc: Boggs, Phil; Perchal, Cheryl; Peters, Jerry Subject: Adaytum Status 11-20-01 I am out of the office tomorrow and wanted to get some communication out on the Adaytum O&M project. I haven't had a chance to talk to Phil on this so this is only my opinion on the project so far. This will just be a brief rundown. I can expand upon any of the items at your request. Planned this week: Call Hoang Vo on a couple issues. (See accomplished below) Decipher what Rita accomplished in the model and what still needs to be completed. Understand the model. Accomplished this week: Called Hoang Vo on 11-19. Issues: 1. Can't open large cubes. Hoang knows this is a problem. There is a similar issue with a Houston application which they need to redesign. 2. Importing to contributor after allocations ran. Hoang is working on a script. He will send to us once he has it finished. Until then we could do it manually but Hoang would have to step us though this process taking away from his time writing the script. Side note: if we can't get the allocations back to contributor, then the users (me right now) can't do much testing besides inputting. Documentation. Phil and I have been going through d-lists and d-cubes trying to determine the purpose of each. Discovered some d-lists and d-cubes that we may not need and documented questions on others. This written documentation should assist new users of our application. Cube Renaming - We have renamed the Merit SBP Model to just Merit Model. This is the only bright spot in the week as renaming cubes seems to be a simple process with the name change occurring in all the appropriate places for links and macros to still work. Outstanding Issues: Phil and I have come to the conclusion that we need further assistance from Hoang or another consultant familiar with this application. We are in need of a summary, manager build, and some sort of documented process on how to run this application. I am not at all comfortable with the application in its present state but feel we can make some progress if we had a complete roadmap of the application and someone to ask questions of. In a phone conference this afternoon, we were told that getting actuals into the Adaytum O&M application would not be ready for January 2002 close. ETS thought that the whole actuals process was being addressed under the Project Sunrise umbrella which is not the case. Now ETS must champion this effort. It is being headed up by Greg Lewis but there is not an estimated completion date. Deb x7831 Not everything that can be counted counts, & not everything that counts can be counted.

Here are my notes. Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order. The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements. Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds. Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call. Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them. Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company. Enron assets will be revalued at closing. The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred. If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration. If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred. Debt\/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative. ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity. Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage. In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings. Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true. Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM. Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way. Lay: had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN\/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash. Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound\/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible. However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks. BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office \/ trading books will need to be combined at closing. EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there. The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets. Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model. They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets\/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies. Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson\/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk\/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses. Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities. McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates. Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity. Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed). Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices. ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'. (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner. They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination. They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained. Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions. He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player. He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well. Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments. Patrick Tucker x3-3055","label":0}

{"text":"The thesis: we hand out thumb drives at events, which could infect the reporters\/attendees' computers. So that means that we're bad at cybersecurity. Okay. Buzzfeed: These Experts Think The DNC And RNC Are Both Horrible At Cybersecurity Both the Democratic and Republican National Committees have handed out hundreds of thumb drives to reporters ahead of their national conventions, in a move cybersecurity experts call \"borderline stupidity.\" posted on May 5, 2016, at 4:47 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO - Keeping America safe from the armies of hackers at the shores, has come up a lot in the 2016 election cycle but if the Republican and Democratic National Conventions are anything to go by, whichever party wins the race for president has not studied up on their cybersecurity basics. Reporters who registered for the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were given tote bags by convention organizers filled with instructions and logistical information. Buried inside the totes were thumb drives, also known as USB flash drives, with information on the upcoming events. \"Who does that anymore? It's just asking to get infected with any variety of malware,\" said Ajay Arora, CEO of VERA , a cybersecurity firm. \"Those thumb drives are the number one way to infect a computer... It is borderline stupidity to give them out to people, or for people to even think of using them.\" Thumb drives are known within the cybersecurity world for their fundamental security weaknesses, because when someone plugs a thumb drive into their computers they are opening up their system to anything on that drive - from the best hotels to stay in during the Republican National Convention to a virus that silently uploads itself onto the hard drive. Neither the Republican or Democratic National Committees replied to a BuzzFeed News inquiry about the thumb drives. Jason Haddix, director of technical operations at Bugcrowd , a security-testing startup, said that in the past he would help private companies test their internal security by dropping random USB sticks around their building and parking lot. \"We would drop them off or even hand them out as freebies to see who would fall for it and use the thumb drives. We had them install a program where we could show the company exactly which employee was using it and how we easily we could track their computers,\" Haddix said. It's the kind of trick hackers might use if they were trying to infect a company's internal system, and it shows how easy it is to move malware from a thumb drive onto a computer. Arora said it's been at least five years since he's seen a thumb drive handed out at a conference in the U.S., though he admits he normally attends cybersecurity events where \"no one is dumb enough to do this anymore.\" \"These politicians are saying they want to decide what to encrypt, and what to regulate and give back doors to, are these same people who are turning around and saying here, take this piece of hardware which is proven to be the worst thing security wise, and put it into your computer,\" said Arora. \"They turn around and do a 1.0 mistake, which shows just how unqualified they are being able to talk about security and cybersecurity, let alone legislate on it.\" Eric Walker walkere@dnc.org 732-991-1489 @ericmwalker","label":0}

{"text":"On the record, the suggestion there's anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law or reality, as recognized by numerous independent experts that have looked at this. Their claims are wrong. Period. The fact is both campaigns signed on to similar agreements. While only one campaign is currently using their joint victory fund we encourage both of our campaigns to identify opportunities to support the national and state Democratic parties now so that we can continue to build the infrastructure to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. On background, take a look at what the Election Law Blog posted: \"it is hard to see what provision of the law\" is at issue. As the blog points out, \"legally\" the criticism of the fund \"seems weak.\"  Also on background, their math is wrong. While money has obviously been spent for fundraising costs (which is absolutely necessary in order to raise the 60 million dollars they keep referencing) there are millions of dollars still sitting in HVF that are allocated to the DNC and the state parties, and that will therefore be transferred to the DNC and the state parties. They have not yet been distributed because the point of the party portion of HVF is to raise money to fund the general election. The math is also wrong on the Politico story for the same reason. Their claim that state parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised is incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions have been raised for state parties and just haven't been distributed to them yet (nor has it gone to the DNC or anywhere else). Because this is money for the general election, and coordinated campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, it is perfectly understandable that not all of that money that will eventually go to state parties would have been distributed yet.

{"text":"And one of them is mine! I encourage you to read these two letters. I think they definitely impinge. They are much longer than newspapers normally like to publish, which is good. The editor must have thought it important enough to give us more space. We actually got more words than the one we were responding to. Doyle Mills' letter: There are \"facts\" and then there is the truth Your recently published a letter from two social workers - Ms. Gutman and Ms. Jarvis - on the subject of TeenScreen. Curiously, it was entitled the \"facts\" about the TeenScreen program. I think the social workers should crack open a dictionary and look up what a \"fact\" is. Obviously with no investigation of their own, they accept and spew the \"facts\" given to them by TeenScreen. One of the definitions for facts is \"something said to be true or supposed to have happened,\" as in this example: \"The facts given by the witness are highly questionable.\" Yet the public doesn't want or need that kind of \"facts\" to be presented as truth. They need real facts, as in this definition: \"something that actually exists; reality; truth.\" Ms. Gutman's and Ms. Jarvis' letter is full of assertions, none of which can be proven by evidence. TeenScreen spawned a lawsuit in Indiana because a teen was screened and labeled with a mental disorder without her parents' knowledge. TeenScreen refuses to release the identity of their mysterious donors. Many members of TeenScreen's executive board have connections to drug companies. TeenScreen's biggest supporter and co-conspirator is NAMI, which receives millions from drug companies, a verifiable fact because NAMI is a non-profit organization required to reveal its contributors. TeenScreen is intimately involved in treatment, as evidenced by the fact that TeenScreen always partners with a local mental health provider so that identified youth can be directed into treatment. That information can be found on TeenScreen's own website. Suicide IS a horrible tragedy. No one is denying that. Yet, suicide is very, very, very rare. If you want to see how rare, click on  You'll see that the suicide rate for youth in Iowa as reported by the CDC is 2.62 per 100,000. That's a very small number. Screening identifies 30% or higher youth as needing further evaluation. Screening is obviously good for finding new customers for the mental health system but it's complete folly to pretend that its purpose is finding those at risk and preventing suicide. Add to that the FACT that the FDA requires a black box warning on antidepressants, the same ones that will be given to some of these kids entering the mental health system via TeenScreen. This warning states that the drugs can CAUSE suicidal tendencies and violence in young people. Ms. Gutman and Ms. Jarvis neglected to mention that fact. Everything I have stated here is verifiable, backed up by evidence. Though this may be an editorial, I am not stating an opinion. I am stating documented, provable fact. Doyle Mills Clearwater, FL Elizabeth Cameron's letter: Statistics don't indicate a significant danger I am writing in response to the letter \"Here are the facts about the TeenScreen Program.\" This letter makes it sound like suicide is a pervasive threat for Iowa children...one of such grave dimensions that it requires wholesale screening through the schools to catch the many desperate children whose difficulties would otherwise go unnoticed. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, however, would indicate otherwise: In 2004, 19 Iowa children between the ages of 0 - 18 committed suicide out of a total of 724, 095. That is a percentage of .00262%, or 2.62 per 100,000 people. That is hardly an epidemic. For the rare child who really is in trouble, though, it seems reasonable to ask whether TeenScreen and the recommendations that follow it will actually do him any good. First of all, is it not unlikely that his unhappiness will have been noticed already by somebody - parents, teachers, minister, coaches, or friends? Are we so unobservant that only an official suicide questionnaire will uncover a child on the edge? I doubt it. Secondly, even if this were likely, does it really justify asking leading, suggestive questions to thousands upon thousands of other children, subjecting them to the possibility of misdiagnosing, mislabeling, and potentially damaging treatments? I don't think so. And last, supposing that we screen everybody and really do catch a child who appears to be in trouble - then what? In the wake of this assessment - whatever else is recommended - the follow-up is very likely to include a referral, a diagnosis, and a prescription. Once in the hands of a psychiatric professional, diagnosis will be made on the basis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which has been thoroughly discredited. Then, prescription, and no help there. Black box warnings have been added to various psychiatric drugs on the basis that they can actually increase the likelihood of suicide. So what do we do? We get this TeenScreen program out of the schools, and help children without hurting them. Caring parents and teachers and ministers and friends can do far more to bring children up to an enthusiasm for life than all the assessments and diagnoses and prescriptions in Christendom.

Last week John McCain was caught talking about Trump's impact on his race, particularly with the Latino community, saying how Trump damages his reelection hopes. But yesterday, in a clear opportunity to buck his party's nominee in regards to the racist comments, McCain stood silent. When asked if he'd want Trump to retract his comments made against the Latino community calling them 'rapists' and 'criminals,' McCain said on CNN , \"Oh, I don't know.\" In the meantime, as more Americans favor a Senate vote on Garland's nomination, this weekend Senator Flake talked about why he's playing along with Senate Republicans in holding up Garland's hearing and vote. In an interview with Meet the Press , Flake said \"if we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him [Judge Garland] quickly because I'm certain that he will be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination come January.\" \"John McCain and Jeff Flake can't have it both ways,\" said Arizona Democratic Party spokesman Enrique Gutierrez. \"Either you stand with or stand opposed to Donald Trump. Trying to cherry pick Donald Trump's reckless positions for their own political purposes is just too dangerous for the people of Arizona. Trump has proven he doesn't have the temperament or judgement to be president, and if McCain and Flake stand with Trump's divisive agenda, voters will hold them accountable.\" ###","label":0}

{"text":"Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 07:55 GMT 08:55 UK Lennon killer seeks parole again The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's 62nd birthday. Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980. It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from Attica state prison. At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the ex-Beatle. Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star. Shot dead Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New York City apartment on 8 December 1980. He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice. Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him. The killer said Lennon had been just \"a picture on an album cover\" to him before the shooting. 'Deserved death' Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if Chapman were released. Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would have been 62 on Wednesday. ------------------------ Yahoo!

This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now! As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, a startling revelation that Microsoft refuses to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the very things the product is meant to stop - worms and intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying desktops based on AMD processors! Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first place?

See You in August, Randy Nieland GnomeNETWORK SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, various bits of configuration information are stored in a setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been captured in order to configure the services. Prior to certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear text, which is problematic because the file is left on the hard drive after the installation process is completed. Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your environment. SQL Server Cumulative Patch A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to improper permissions within the registry. All three are spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described further in this bulletin. GnomeSYSTEM Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments Unearthed by Wayne Clark Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent explanation of one particular situation where memory pools can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be certain you know what you're messing with or you could just make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

{"text":"THE WEEK IN REVIEW: Quit copying Search News.com All CNET The Web Live tech help NOW! April's tech award 1 million open jobs News.com: Top CIOs ZDNet: PeopleSoft CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email Saturday, July 13, 2002 If you've ever taped a \"Seinfeld\" episode or traded music online, Uncle Sam may want you--to stop. Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transferring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which would limit backup copies, has drawn objections from academics and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it. Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio segment generally may \"sell or otherwise dispose of\" that analog recording or digital file as they wish. The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substantial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a consumer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as \"fair use.\" Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge said that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software. The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software. However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sharman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in the South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permission to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week that Sharman could be added to the lawsuit. Shoring up U.S. security Computer security is becoming increasingly critical to President Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-called cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked committees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end of the week. Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Internet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protection functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center. Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own privacy czar. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure that new technologies \"sustain and do not erode\" privacy protections and to verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guidelines. Who's running your computer? Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going on now with their computers. Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers piggyback malicious code on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service. According to the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full instructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacker to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X. The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating mechanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. According to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature downloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem. Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applications may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages or in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail could carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, read their documents and execute programs on their computer. Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi wireless networking technology has made its debut. IQinVision plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to put video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly install a temporary security system. This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standard. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camera maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is also invading handheld devices. Wireless equipment maker Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networking technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The card, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth quarter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other companies. Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and owners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless capabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the card, wireless access becomes an option for many. Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networking. Broadband providers are cracking down on some customers, threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access. After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi \"hot spots\" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at least 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the Net, for fun or for profit. News.com special focus: China As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the global recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerged as a primary target for foreign business.

{"text":"From: Michael Briggs Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 9:53 AM To: Brinster, Jeremy Subject: NEWS: Sanders Backs California Initiative to Stop Rx Ripoffs [Image removed by sender. Bernie 2016] Sanders Backs California Initiative to Stop Rx Ripoffs May 10, 2016 Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653 SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday backed a California ballot initiative to save state taxpayers from being ripped off by pharmaceutical companies which charge Americans the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. \"While Congress has failed to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, the people of California can by supporting this ballot initiative,\" the Vermont senator said. The California Drug Price Relief Act is supported by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and National Nurses United, both headquartered in Oakland, California. \"Americans living with HIV\/AIDS and cancer should not live in fear that they will go bankrupt because of the outrageously high cost of their prescription drugs,\" Sanders said. The proposition would prohibit the state from paying more for a prescription drug than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The nationwide VA health care system negotiates lower prices for pharmaceuticals. As a former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Sanders authored landmark legislation reforming the health care system for veterans. \"We know that the VA pays considerably less than retail prices for prescription drugs. The people of California and all Americans should get the same price,\" Sanders said. Prices for prescription medicine in the United States soared last year more than 10 percent \u2013 the third consecutive year of double digit price increases. One out of five adults between the ages of 18 and 64 \u2013 more than 35 million Americans \u2013 cannot afford the medications that their doctors prescribe. \"In the richest country in the history of the world,\" Sanders said, \"that is unacceptable.\" The pharmaceutical industry is bankrolling a campaign to defeat the California initiative. \"It is no surprise that the pharmaceutical industry already has dedicated $50 million to defeat this ballot initiative,\" Sanders said. \"Their greed has no end.\" In Congress, Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland have introduced comprehensive legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Their bills would authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and reduce barriers to the importation of lower-cost drugs from Canada and other countries. Sanders and Cummings, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, also have spotlighted steep price increases for generic drugs. The increases cost taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion over the last decade, according to a study Sanders and Cummings requested from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. Prices of top-selling generic drugs rose faster than inflation 22 percent of the time over the 10-year period examined by the study. Sanders was in California this week ahead of the state's June 7 presidential primary election. To read the senator's statement, click here .

{"text":"Dear folks, I've been doing some calculations to address one of the statistical issues raised by the Douglass et al. paper in the International Journal of Climatology. Here are some of my results. Recall that Douglass et al. calculated synthetic T2LT and T2 temperatures from the CMIP-3 archive of 20th century simulations (\"20c3m\" runs). They used a total of 67 20c3m realizations, performed with 22 different models. In calculating the statistical uncertainty of the model trends, they introduced sigma{SE}, an \"estimate of the uncertainty of the mean of the predictions of the trends\". They defined sigma{SE} as follows: sigma{SE} = sigma \/ sqrt(N - 1), where \"N = 22 is the number of independent models\". As we've discussed in our previous correspondence, this definition has serious problems (see comments from Carl and Steve below), and allows Douglass et al. to reach the erroneous conclusion that modeled T2LT and T2 trends are significantly different from the observed T2LT and T2 trends in both the RSS and UAH datasets. This comparison of simulated and observed T2LT and T2 trends is given in Table III of Douglass et al. [As an amusing aside, I note that the RSS datasets are referred to as \"RSS\" in this table, while UAH results are designated as \"MSU\". I guess there's only one true \"MSU\" dataset...] I decided to take a quick look at the issue of the statistical significance of differences between simulated and observed tropospheric temperature trends. My first cut at this \"quick look\" involves only UAH and RSS observational data - I have not yet done any tests with radiosonde datas, UMD T2 data, or satellite results from Zou et al. I operated on the same 49 realizations of the 20c3m experiment that we used in Chapter 5 of CCSP 1.1. As in our previous work, all model results are synthetic T2LT and T2 temperatures that I calculated using a static weighting function approach. I have not yet implemented Carl's more sophisticated method of estimating synthetic MSU temperatures from model data (which accounts for effects of topography and land\/ocean differences). However, for the current application, the simple static weighting function approach is more than adequate, since we are focusing on T2LT and T2 changes over tropical oceans only - so topographic and land-ocean differences are unimportant. Note that I still need to calculate synthetic MSU temperatures from about 18-20 20c3m realizations which were not in the CMIP-3 database at the time we were working on the CCSP report. For the full response to Douglass et al., we should use the same 67 20c3m realizations that they employed. For each of the 49 realizations that I processed, I first masked out all tropical land areas, and then calculated the spatial averages of monthly-mean, gridded T2LT and T2 data over tropical oceans (20N-20S). All model and observational results are for the common 252-month period from January 1979 to December 1999 - the longest period of overlap between the RSS and UAH MSU data and the bulk of the 20c3m runs. The simulated trends given by Douglass et al. are calculated over the same 1979 to 1999 period; however, they use a longer period (1979 to 2004) for calculating observational trends - so there is an inconsistency between their model and observational analysis periods, which they do not explain. This difference in analysis periods is a little puzzling given that we are dealing with relatively short observational record lengths, resulting in some sensitivity to end-point effects. I then calculated anomalies of the spatially-averaged T2LT and T2 data (w.r.t. climatological monthly-means over 1979-1999), and fit least-squares linear trends to model and observational time series. The standard errors of the trends were adjusted for temporal autocorrelation of the regression residuals, as described in Santer et al. (2000) [\"Statistical significance of trends and trend differences in layer-average atmospheric temperature time series\"; JGR 105, 7337-7356.] Consider first panel A of the attached plot. This shows the simulated and observed T2LT trends over 1979 to 1999 (again, over 20N-20S, oceans only) with their adjusted 1-sigma confidence intervals). For the UAH and RSS data, it was possible to check against the adjusted confidence intervals independently calculated by Dian during the course of work on the CCSP report. Our adjusted confidence intervals are in good agreement. The grey shaded envelope in panel A denotes the 1-sigma standard error for the RSS T2LT trend. There are 49 pairs of UAH-minus-model trend differences and 49 pairs of RSS-minus-model trend differences. We can therefore test - for each model and each 20c3m realization - whether there is a statistically significant difference between the observed and simulated trends. Let bx and by represent any single pair of modeled and observed trends, with adjusted standard errors s{bx} and s{by}. As in our previous work (and as in related work by John Lanzante), we define the normalized trend difference d as: d = (bx - by) \/ sqrt[ (s{bx})**2 + (s{by})**2 ] Under the assumption that d is normally distributed, values of d > +1.96 or Hi Steve > > I'd say it's the equivalent of rolling a 6-sided die a hundred times, and > finding a mean value of ~3.5 and a standard deviation of ~1.7, and > calculating the standard error of the mean to be ~0.17 (so far so > good).

{"text":"Dear Evelyn and Chris, re. proposal review GC04-203, Meko et al. \"A synthesis of 19th century climate data for the United States from paleo, archival and instrumental sources\". I have read the \"Reviewer conflict of interest and confidentiality...\" document and can state that I have no conflict of interest and will abide by the confidentiality provisions etc. I reviewed a very similar proposal by this group 1 year ago, and enclose my review of that proposal below. The new proposal has taken into account my two main concerns from last time, which were: (i) that creation only of a blended data set that contained a time varying mixture of proxy and instrumental data would limit the usefulness because its quality would be time varying, perhaps in an unquantified way, and independent study of errors between proxy and observed data would be prevented; and (ii) that the proposed work was not very innovative in terms of the applications for which the new information would be used. Both of these points have been addressed adequately and so I now rate it \"Excellent (5)\" for scientific\/technical merit, and \"High (5)\" for importance\/relevance and applicability. One issue that I would like to raise, however, is that the need for quantifying uncertainty\/error in the reconstructions\/database is not given much coverage in the proposal. It is mentioned, but not focused on. For many applications (testing models, comparison with other reconstructions, detection of unusual climate trends\/events), explicitly quantified error estimates are essential. These often change magnitude through time, and thus should be estimated in such a way as to allow this. They may also change with time scale (often being lower for, e.g., a decadal mean than for a single year's value), and again the error estimation method should capture this. I do not think that this issue detracts from the quality of the proposal. Instead I am mentioning it in the hope that this comment can be passed on to the proposers, in the event that the project is funded, so that they can be prompted into placing the appropriate emphasis on quantifying uncertainty. Apologies for being late yet again, and best regards, Tim Date: Thu, 24 Oct 2002 17:14:31 +0000 Subject: confidential assessment of GC03-512 From: Tim Osborn To: CC: , Dear Irma and Chris, Re. proposal review GC03-512, PI: David Meko \"A 19th century data catalog\" First of all, I confirm that there is no conflict of interest etc. Now to my review... (1) Scientific Merit Rating: Good Comments: I completely agree with the rationale behind improving data sets of 19th century climate (see my comments below on \"Relevance to climate change programme\"), and the proposers have identified the most relevant data sources available for the US. The objectives and workplan are generally reasonable, but I have rated it \"good\" rather than \"very good\" or \"excellent\" because it does not seem as scientifically innovative or challenging as it might. Some particular concerns are highlighted below. I am very wary about the proposed approach of integrating the data sources together to produce a single climate product. Obviously the data sources have to be used in combination, for calibration of proxy data or for assessment of possibly dubious early instrumental data, *but* combining them all into a single product only will be very restrictive for future use, assessment, improvements. Much better would be to produce intrumental-only series for whatever length is available, and tree-ring only series for the full length (i.e., into the late 19th and 20th centuries, despite the availability of instrumental data for these periods). Blending them into a single analysis is of some, but limited, use and comparisons of different periods and with (e.g.) model simulations can only ever be done by taking into account error bars that vary dramatically in time and are only estimates of the \"true\" errors - and the error estimates may be underestimates if based only on residuals or covariances during the 20th century. No mention is made of using the 19th century data to consider key issues such as difference between tree-ring and ground borehole temperatures (they differ more in the 19th century, in terms of trend, than in other centuries), possibly taking into account land-use change. No mention is made of using the 19th century data to assess multi-century temperature reconstructions and why they differ. These are issues of great importance. No mention is investigating seasonal dependence of temperature changes, which are greater in existing temperature products during the 19th century than in the 20th century and which has important implications for the calibration of proxy (including tree-ring) data against summer or annual data and the need to more clearly define the true seasonal response of proxy data. Despite these concerns, the proposed work is certainly worthy of funding and the extra items of interest that I mention above could be achieved using the data generated here, in some future project. (2) Relevance to climate change programme Rating: High Comments: The 19th century is certainly of particular importance, not just for the reasons outlined in the proposal but also because this century shows some of the biggest disagreements in warming trend between various quasi-hemispheric temperature reconstructions and between proxy and instrumental data and between different seasons of instrumental data. Additional data sources are definitely required, and additional digitisation, homogenisation and intercomparison of data sets is necessary. For these reasons, work such as that proposed here is essential for helping to refine answers to questions such as how unusual is late twentieth century climate and detection of climate change signals against the noise of natural climate variability.

{"text":"Comrades, In response to some of the talk in the nsmworld e-list about doing a White March on the Nations Capitol, the NSM is currently in the process of working on this matter. Such things take time, however, big plans are in the works for 2008, and you can expect us to be at the forefront, taking the fight directly into the streets as usual. I am not making an Official announcement at this point, however when I do, we will be calling for all factions of the Pro-White Movement to Unite for that day to form up the largest Pro-White march of this decade. All ego's, drama, and differences will be cast aside, for the eyes of the Public and Worldwide media will be upon us. A word of advice, start saving up some travel money now, because in 2008 we will be making History and all Pro-White activists should want to be part of it. A CALL FOR ACTION, NOT WORDS!!!

{"text":"Dear Partners in Workpackage 1 of IMPRINT, today is the deadline by which Eystein requested input as regards the reworked (and necessarily much shortened), proposal document. We have also been making some effort to consolidate the indicative budgets that most of you have sent to us. We now need to transfer these figures to Eystein , even though a few partners have not supplied numbers to us , though they may have sent them to Eystein directly. It is clear that we are now close to 30 partners in Workpackage 1 alone, and have indicative budget requests totaling well over the nominal 5 million Euro originally allocated. In fact , the likely total with all partner requests included is likely to be nearer to 10 million! We have been given a (very unofficial) hint from Brussels that an \"appropriate\" total project request of about 17 million for IMPRINT might be sensible , with a final figure , if the project ever gets accepted, of 15 million being possibly awarded (subject of course to referees' comments and subsequent reorganisation of priorities). The simple message is that Eystein will now have to make an executive decision as to the total amount requested . If we ever get that far, reorganised budgets will have to be decided on the basis of very specific work plans that will need to formalised for a second submission - especially as they relate to the justification for field work and new data analyses. We also need to budget for the involvement of non-partners , possibly using a mixture of workshop and minor funding awards to facilitate data collection etc. It has been made clear that new practical work campaigns would not be sanctioned across all Tasks in Workpackage 1 . Rather, the bulk of work would involve re-dating\/interpretation of mostly existing data and reconstructions of forcings and climate . Specific cases will have to be made to justify sampling and processing of new data. Thanks to all of you for your help and thanks to Eystein for taking on the enormous task of organising this proposal .

{"text":"Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating. We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. The pipelines are not being sold. Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line. Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence. We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate. This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash. I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company. On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read: . This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

{"text":"20:00-about 30:30 Trump: people who have done far less have had their lives destroyed re: HRC. She will win nomination over the next month or so Bernie is fighting crooked HRC. Think she would be easier to beat than Bernie bc she has so much baggage Q: How to defeat HRC. How mean or nasty can you be? I never debated professionally before. I won Drudge polls, online polls. I won all polls in all debates. I sort of like debating. I was center-stage on every debate HRC is not a bad debater. I think they will be positive for me. I sort of wish we had more than 3. I think we should have more than 3 if you want to know the truth Q: Janet Yellen. Not right person for the job? Should she raise rates or no? Nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. Don't know her, she is very capable She is not a Republican, I most likely would replace her. She is a low interest rate person. I am also a low interest rate person If dollar gets too strong with low interest rates we can be in trouble Japan is killing us on trade Devaluation is single greatest tool countries can use against us. China is like the grand master of all grand masters of it If inflation starts coming in, that's a different story. But right now, I want low interest rates When dollar started going up, we are going to lose all our business All my friends do in China is watch the value of the US dollar. They just want to see it go up. They love to see it go up. It sounds better to have a strong dollar than it actually is We have $19 trillion in debt. We are paying a low interest rate, but if it goes a little up, we don't have a country. The numbers are staggering. If interest rates went up 2-5 points we could be in trouble I am the king of debt. I love debt, I like playing with it. Q: Premium increases coming bc of ACA. What could you do without legislation. If you go back, I said 2016 and 2017 is going to be a total disaster bc of the ACA. It's the ACA. Numbers will be staggering for people and the country You need to repeal and replace Obamacare. Its good for almost no one. We have to get something better than what we have right now Deductibles are going up to numbers that no one can believe. You need to almost die to be able to use it. ACA is a total failure and a disaster Q: King of debt and renegotiated debt agreements over the years I borrowed knowing you can pay back with discounts. Of course I was swash-buckling and it did well for me that was good for me. Debt was always sort of interesting to me but now we are in a different situation with a country. I borrowed knowing that if the economy crashed I could make a deal. Its like making a deal before going into a poker game Q: Are you suggesting we would negotiate with the US credit No I think there are times for us to refinance debt with longer term. We owe so much longer with longer term Nobody talks about it but the bubble could pop. We have seen that, and it looks ugly. It was bad, but you haven't seen it as bad as it could be From: Miller, Lindsey Sent: Thursday, May 05, 2016 10:18 AM To: Comm_D Subject: RE: Video Request: Trump on Squawk Box Through about 20:30. Says his tax plan is open for negotiation Thinks regulatory\/tax reform can cause GDP to grow When China goes down to 7 percent growth, they go crazy and into a recession. We have basically 0 growth, maybe less - how are they coming up with these numbers? Dodd-Frank has to be eliminated or changed. So many friends who can't do business with the banks Regulators running the banks. I'm not blaming banks, I'm blaming regulations Taxes - one critique is that tax cuts go to top 1%. How do you square that? I will say this. When you put out tax plan, there are negotiations back and forth and I can see that going up. We are cutting - I don't want middle going up but I can see \"that\" going up. Wealthy have dozen well, I'm not complaining. (it's choppy but I think he implies he'd raise taxes on the rich) People haven't had a wage increase. These people who come to my rallies, many of them haven't had raise in 20 years and some are making less money now than 20 years ago but their taxes are higher. That's why they don't like either party, conservatives or liberals. Cruz debate with Trump supporter - these people are smart, hard-working but have been disenfranchised. Who would you rather run against, HRC or Bernie? The system rigged against him. The system rigged against me, this wasn't supposed to happen. The people of the country great, have had bad leadership, unfair tax policy and we'll straighten it out so everyone benefits. Doesn't want to say who he'd rather run against. Bernie can't make it so its irrelevant. Super delegates are ridiculous. He would be easier probably, he's a socialist\/communist. She's going to be just fine. You need to be able to raise a lot of money. You'll raise a lot of money from people you maybe haven't gotten along with. How will that work? It's a long answer. I have great relationships with so many, especially business. I was harsh on Bush family and that's why they want to sit it out, I don't care. We're going to have some people who don't want to play the game. Doesn't matter if they don't want to endorse. I'm watching HRC fighting Bernie. I was supposed to go on until July. I'm now watching her fight it out. She'll win because the system rigged unless she gets indicted but she's being protected by the Democrats. She should be because she's so guilty. Bernie can't win because he's fighting crooked HRC.

Lockrgnome's Top 50 Mac OS X Tips is in publication and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list has improved my personal OS X experience. Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the \"Review by\" links at the bottom of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris and Randy. I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. Either way, I'm open to some AppleScript suggestions.

This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock.

From the command line type: sudo chown username filename You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will replace filename. 50 LINUX TIPS: From the mind behind the Penguin Shell come two more eBooks in the GnomeTome series.

{"text":"Obamacare brings record low for US health uninsured rate CNBC How low can Obamacare go? Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first time ever in the nation's history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, and a clear sign of Obamacare's impact. The U.S. uninsurance rate fell to 9.1 percent last year, according to data released Tuesday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was the first time the percentage of people without some form of health coverage has gone into single digits, and a 2.4 percentage point drop from 2014. The number of people uninsured in 2015 was 28.6 million, which was 7.4 million fewer than 2014, according to the CDC. Since 2011, when the uninsured rate stood at 15.1 percent, that rate has fallen 6 full percentage points, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey. Obamacare began going into full effect in 2014, which was the first year that people could have private health insurance plans purchased on government-run marketplaces. That was also the first year that nearly all Americans were obligated to have some form of health insurance or face a possible tax penalty. Before that, the Affordable Care Act had for the first time allowed adults under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health plans, which was another factor that has played a role in driving down the uninsured rate. A third factor in bringing down the uninsured rate has been the expansion of Medicaid benefits in a majority of states to cover many more poor adults than had been eligible under that joint federal-state health insurance program before the ACA became law. The Obama administration has said more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage since the ACA became law in 2010. The new report Tuesday was warmly greeted by the Obama administration, which last week lost a key court decision that, if upheld, could damage the Obamacare program. A federal court judge ruled that the administration violated the law by giving insurers money, without congressional approval, to offset the cost of covering subsidized out-of-pocket health costs of many Obamacare customers. The administration also has been dealing with a flurry of news stories detailing possibly steeper Obamacare rate hikes for 2017, and the departure of some insurers from various markets across the nation. Sylvia Burwell, secretary of health and human services, said, \"Today's report is further proof that our country has made undeniable and historic strides thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\" \"The report documents the progress we've made expanding coverage across the country,\" Burwell said. \"Meanwhile, premiums for employer coverage, Medicare spending and health-care prices have risen at exceptionally slow rates. Our country ought to be proud of how far we've come and where we're going,\" she said. The CDC's survey found that among adults aged 18-64, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 16.3 percent in 2014 to 12.8 percent last year. \"A corresponding increase was seen in the percentage having private coverage, from 67.3 percent to 69.7 percent, respectively,\" the report said. \"Among children aged 0-17 years, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 5.5 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015,\" the report said. \"Among those under age 65, the percentage with private coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace [the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov] or state-based exchanges increased from 2.5 percent (6.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 3.4 percent (9.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015,\" according to the CDC. The report said that In 2015, adults between the ages of 25 and 34 were more than twice as likely as adults aged 45 to 64 to lack health insurance coverage - 17.9 percent compared with 8.8 percent. \"In 2015, 27.7 percent of Hispanic, 14.4 percent of non-Hispanic black, 8.7 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 7.9 percent of non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 lacked health insurance coverage at the time of interview,\" the report said. \"Significant decreases in the percentage of uninsured adults were observed between 2013 and 2015 for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian adults,\" the report said. \"Hispanic adults had the greatest percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate between 2013 and 2015,\" falling from 40.6 percent to 27.7 percent, according to the report.","label":0}

{"text":"I am just having to go so I will think about the \"should we?\" . The answer to the \"can we?\" is yes. I have spoken to the person organising the editorial review and she has promised me she will get it to us in the next week or so. If we can get it back immediattely she says we can make the December issue. Therefore it is possible to do the edits if it means very little change to the text. I have also confirmed that we will pay 1500 dollars for the colour and they say they are working on these now. I really want to get this into the 2000 so I can include it in the RAE. Ed is here now and has some great looking extended PDSI reconstructions (1000 years) for the western US. I am suspicious as to whether the negative trend in Mike's Hockey stick prior to the 20th century is not at least partly the result of a trend in the long high elevation western US trees he uses . Malcolm sent me some figures for the HIHOL meeting and in this work he cuts off the juvenile growth sections of the long tree data but does no detrending on the remainder. This might leave a linear age trend in these data. I remember that Mike in his long reconstruction , stated that the pc representing the western US stuff was essential for getting a verifiable result. Interesting , but only a diversion. We can discuss the JGR and other stuff in Avignon. Hope your weekend was a god one. I tend to agree a bout the NAO meeting- you could use the money (and perhaps time) to better effect. At 04:24 PM 10\/19\/00 +0100, you wrote: Keith, have you had to produce the camera-ready copy for the age-banded JGR paper yet? If not, then is it possible to make some minor changes to it? For the comparison with the Mann et al. reconstruction, I had previously just taken their land&marine full northern hemisphere mean annual temperature time series and re-calibrated it against the instrumental land north of 20N Apr-Sep mean temperature time series. Well, I have not taken the Mann et al. spatial temperature field reconstructions, and computed a land north of 20N area mean. I still have to re-calibrate it against the instrumental series because it is an annual rather than Apr-Sep mean. After doing all this, you'll be pleased to know that the final figure is only slightly different (the Mann et al. curve is very slightly more of an outlier during the 1500-1700 period, and is cooler and closer to observations post-1950, but not much different elsewhere). What does change, however, are the correlations. The correlations with instrumental data are slightly worse (from 0.76 to 0.73, and from 0.92 to 0.89 decadal), but I'm not sure that we show these anyway. But the cross-correlations between the Mann et al. and the other reconstructions (which we do show) are all stronger than previously - which now seems a little unfair on them. Cross-correlations between unfiltered series: Mann versus: Jones, Briffa (ABD), Briffa (Torn+Tai+Yam) before: 0.47, 0.36, 0.33 now: 0.50, 0.37, 0.34 Cross-correlations between 50-yr smoothed series: Mann versus: Jones, Briffa (ABD), Briffa (T+T+Y), Overpeck, Crowley before: 0.78, 0.43, 0.50, 0.86, 0.76 now: 0.81, 0.51, 0.55, 0.86, 0.78 I don't have a copy of the paper in front of me, but the 'before' values should match those in one of the tables. Some of the 50-yr smoothed new values are noticeably stronger. Can we make these changes still, or is it too late? And do you think we should? Cheers Tim","label":0}

{"text":"**For blasting at 7am** SL: ICYMI: Trump Invests In the Same Companies He Bashes \"Just like Trump bashes China and Mexico despite making his clothing line there, he also bashes companies for media attention despite investing in them for his own personal gain.\" - DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach [Insert full text of article here] Trump invests in the same companies he bashes Eliza Collins , USA TODAY6:06 p.m. EDT May 18, 2016 184 Shares[facebook share][twitter share] [email share][email share] [In this May 7, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential] In this May 7, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Spokane, Wash. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) Maybe Donald Trump never learned the phrase \"put your money where your mouth is.\" Upon review of his Personal Financial Disclosure it turns out that presumed Republican nominee has invested and profited from multiple companies he's slammed on the trail. Mondelez International Trump invested in the parent company of Nabisco, which he has has brought up a lot foroutsourcing jobs to Mexico . \"I'm never eating Oreos again ... I love Oreos. I will never eat them again. Nabisco closes the plant in Chicago and they are moving the plant to Mexico.\" (Fortune , August 2015) Ford Trump has called the automobile company's decision to build a plant in Mexico an \"absolute disgrace\" and said it would never happen under a Trump administration. At one rally he told supporters he'd call the CEO of Ford and threaten a 35% tax on any car made in Mexico. 'Let me give you the bad news. Every car, and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35% tax. Okay? And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.'\" (Fortune , December 2015) General Electric Trump has put money into General Electric. But while campaigning in Connecticut, he called General Electric's move of jobs outside the state \"devastating.\" \"It's so devastating to lose a company like General Electric ... I'm going to bring jobs back to Connecticut and to the country. We're not going to let them go to Mexico. ... They're going everywhere but here because we have people that don't know how to deal, they don't know how to make deals.\" (Hartford Courant , April 2016) Disney Trump bashed the company over a lawsuit that accused them of replacing American workers with foreigners using H1-B visas - and then requiring them to train their replacements. But his anger at the company didn't stop him from investing. \"I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\" (Donald J. Trump , March 2016) Apple After the technology company refused to unlock the phones of the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre, Trump called on his supporters to ban Apple products. Yet, his financial disclosures show he invested in Apple. \"I like the idea of a boycott of Apple until such time as they give that information.\" (Politico , February 2016) United Technologies Corporation Trump also invested in the parent company to Carrier Corp., an Indiana-based air-conditioning manufacturer that is in the process of outsourcing thousands of jobs to Mexico. In an interview with Breitbart News after Carrier's announcement, Trump spoke broadly about the need to lower taxes. \"First of all, you're going to have to look to lower taxes [for those who do business inside the United States] - and we may very well have to charge taxes at the border, when somebody drives a car through the border to sell it in the United States. But look, we've closed our plants. We've lost our jobs. They're not going to build cars in Mexico and sell them in the United States, OK? We can lower our taxes, and we're probably going to have to charge a surtax at the border. Otherwise we're going to lose a fortune. And that will help Ford and other people make a decision to buy in the United States, to build in the United States.\" (Breitbart News , February 2016) The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment.","label":0}

{"text":"thanks Phil, I did take the liberty of discussing w\/ Gavin, who can of course be trusted to maintain the confidentiality of this. We're in agreement that Keenan has wandered his way into dangerous territory here, and that in its current form this is clearly libellous; there is not even a pretense that he is only investigating the evidence. Furthermore, while many of us fall under the category of 'limited public figures' and therefore the threshold for proving libel is quite high, this is *not* the case for Wei-Chyung. He is not a public figure. I believe they have made a major miscalculation here in treating him as if he is. In the UK, where E&E is published, the threshold is even lower than it is in the states for proving libel. We both think he should seek legal advice on this, as soon as possible. With respect to Peiser's guest editing of E&E and your review, following up on Kevin's suggestions, we think there are two key points. First, if there are factual errors (other than the fraud allegation) it is very important that you point them out now. If not, Keenan could later allege that he made the claims in good faith, as he provided you an opportunity to respond and you did now. Secondly, we think you need to also focus on the legal implications. In particular, you should mention that the publisher of a libel is also liable for damages - that might make Sonja B-C be a little wary. Of course, if it does get published, maybe the resulting settlement would shut down E&E and Benny and Sonja all together! We can only hope, anyway. So maybe in an odd way its actually win-win for us, not them. Lets see how this plays out... RealClimate is of course always available to you as an outlet, if it seems an appropriate venue. But we should be careful not to jump the gun here. Kevin: very sorry to hear about Dennis. Please pass along my best wishes for a speedy recovery if and when it seems appropriate to do so...

{"text":"Dear Keith, Some days ago we have got \"JOINT ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY\" from International Arctic Research Center and Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research University of Alaska Fairbanks. The general theme is Global Change Research in the Arctic (full text with description is attached bellow). As we have read Research Themes from announcement they seem to be very congenial to our laboratory. What do you think about this? Is there point in submitting proposal to IARC and CIFAR at the University of Alaska Fairbanks? Research theme would be 5,000 year summer air temperature reconstruction from tree rings and impacts and consequences of global climate change on forest ecosystems in the Polar Ural and Yamal Peninsula (Subarctic regions of Russia). We have no wide experience to submit proposal to any foreign administration. We need in some advice. Could you give us a piece of good advice how to do this well. The questions are: 1. We are not sure whether this action and theme is contrary to our future cooperative work? 2. If not, how big our chance to get award? 3. Could we submit a proposal from our Institute only without U.S. partner? (Proposals from foreign institutions should preferably have a U.S. partner. See description bellow). If U.S. partner should be, who in your opinion would be? Best regards. Stepan. From: ArcticInfo To: arcticinfo@arcus.org Subject: IARC Announcement of Opportunity For more information on these research opportunities contact: Professor Syun Akasofu, Director, IARC, Phone: 907\/474-6012, Fax: 907\/474-5662, or E-mail: sakasofu@iarc.uaf.edu. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES JOINT ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY International Arctic Research Center and Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research University of Alaska Fairbanks Global Change Research in the Arctic INTRODUCTION Proposals are invited on topics of global change and its effects in the Arctic (detection; interactions and feedbacks; paleoclimates, arctic haze, ozone and UV; contaminants; impacts and consequences of change). The proposal deadline is 1 October 1999 and awards will be made in January 2000. DESCRIPTION The International Arctic Research Center (IARC) and the Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research (CIFAR) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks announce the availability of funding for global change research in the Arctic. The IARC is a new international research center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, established jointly with Japan. The mission of the IARC is to provide an environment that will nurture multidisciplinary research by integrating and synthesizing past, present, and future studies in global change. CIFAR is the NOAA-UAF Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research; it is combining the resources of its Arctic Research Initiative (ARI) with those of IARC under this announcement. The goal is to develop a focal point for a pan-Arctic synthesis of global change in which researchers from many different institutions throughout the United States and the rest of the world participate to combine their research results. Further details on IARC can be found on its web page at and on CIFAR at Proposals may be submitted from U.S. or foreign institutions that address studies on any of the following themes drawn from the IARC Science Plan and the CIFAR Arctic Research Initiative. Proposals from foreign institutions should preferably have a U.S. partner. The starting date for proposed work should be 1 January 2000, with a duration of up to 24 months. Funding for the second year will be contingent on the availability of additional funds, therefore each proposal should have a clear, achievable objective for the first year's work. RESEARCH THEMES 1. Detection of contemporary climate change in the Arctic by ground observations, remote sensing and climate \"fingerprinting\". 2. Arctic paleoclimatic reconstructions from ice cores, tree rings, permafrost, lake and ocean sediments. 3. Atmosphere-ice-land-ocean interactions and feedbacks in the Arctic that affect change, including observations and modeling. 4. Arctic atmospheric chemistry, arctic haze, ozone and UV radiation and their effects. 5. Impacts and consequences of global climate change, including effects on biota and ecosystems in the Arctic. 6. Contaminant sources, transport pathways, and exposure to higher trophic levels and humans in the Arctic. It is planned to fund several large projects and a number of medium ($100K) or smaller projects. Proposals must include the full cost of logistics support required. A total of about $ 4.5M is available in year 1 for this Announcement of Opportunity. Proposals can request support for the following: *Research on any of the above six themes. Proposals that add value to ongoing research projects, or that share costs with other funded investigators, are encouraged. * Conducting workshops at the IARC to further define priorities or synthesize available information on any of the research themes listed above, or any theme from the IARC Science Plan. * Visiting scientists, for short- or longer-term visits, to the IARC in Fairbanks. * Development of generally useful curricula and courses in global change, or conducting global change outreach and educational activities. * U.S. participation in the work of the Arctic Council and its AMAP, CAFF, or PAME working groups. All proposers should meet the following conditions: * PIs must attend an annual synthesis meeting of all IARC\/CIFAR investigators in Fairbanks at which research results will be presented and working groups will synthesize results. Proposal budgets should include travel to Fairbanks. * All activities will be required to acknowledge the financial support from IARC and CIFAR in reports, papers, dissertations, etc. * Progress reports are due from all funded projects on 1 August 2000. * Copies of all publications resulting from funded projects are to be provided to IARC\/CIFAR. Proposals should not exceed 15 pages in text and illustrations, not counting CVs, budget page, and appendices. Further details on proposal preparation are attached below as an appendix. Review criteria for research proposals are: * Does the proposal address the research themes listed above? *Does it propose high-quality research? * Does it advance the NOAA mission? * Is the PI (or are the PIs) well qualified to do the research? * Can the research be done in a timely manner? * Is it likely to lead to significant results? * Is it likely to contribute to a synthesis of research results on global change?

{"text":"Hey Moma Dee, Sorry i haven't been in touch with ya, i have been a little tied up lately. When i got to work today, i decided to email hope and quentin. And after i finished I thought this is something that the whole church might need to hear. So tell me what you think. The last part is ment as The devil's mess took them and God MIGHT place them somewhere else. Okay write back soon. WWJD --------- Inline attachment follows --------- From: To: quentin_da_servant@hotmail.com, HoPeY D.W. Date: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:24:39 GMT Subject: Yall I know yall are tired and need a brake. But I'm going to let yall know, while yall are taking that brake, the devil is going to come in on that brake and do his work for you. Hope when i talk to you last, I asked were you going to be at choir rehearsal and you said, \"Why i ain't going to be there Sunday.\" and you are right, but do you have to get all your blessing through the week, and then give him the praise on sunday. You of all people know that you don't need to have a sunday moring experience on sunday, you can have it in a jail tank on tuesday and wendsday. When you are in a relationship, you are going to do all you can to make it work, if you or quentin didn't have ride, why didn't yall ask me, have i ever turned yall down. Make it work. Quentin, where have you been. I am going to real with ya. When you started coming to the church, You and I was thrilled. I was like finaly, i got someone who is on my level who if in case didn't have a right spirit, I could lift up and if i didn't have the right spirit, he could lift me up. I felt that now it's not only me who can get through to these other young men and be there sort of mentor. I have help now, i don't have to be the only one checking on Matthew, Woyne, Damion, Anthony, Marcus, Mann, Kalid, Howard, Devin, and not to mention the girls. Now me and him can be there Accounters, especially for the first four. Well now we don't have to worry about at least one of the the four, Matthew. I'm not sure, but he doesn't go to the church anymore, nor his family. And i am not saying it your fault, but you act like if they are not rapping, you don't need to be worried about them, i'm being real. I always ask you,\"Q, have you talk to the boys.\" I can't stress this enough, Your presence at the church is greatly missed. And you might say\" well, everybody ain't able to have a nine to five, you got to take what you can get.\" And that is exactly what the devil wants you to feel...Notice I never said your presence on suday morning is greatly missed, i said your presence at the church is. Powertime, Choir Rehearsal, Young adult functions, Afternoon functions, 2nd services, Meetings...You might not see it, but the only God that some of the people might see is through you. You might say, \"Well, if they are going to church just to see me, then they are going for the wrong reason.\" right. But everybody is not on the same spiritual level as us. They are following by example and if they never see you we may never see them. And Hope you already know how we feel about you and the kind of spirit your presence bring. Hope I told you in an email before i went to jail that i almost wanted to give up. And i was still considering it when i typed that. Be careful of what you asked because you just might get it. On that day, I was at work. My supervisor asked me to take some checks down stairs about 4 floors down. I waited for an elevator for a good three minutes, and i figured this was my chance to really talk to God. And i asked hime to give me a renewed spirit, but not all of sudden. Let it be gradually. I promise, when i said a man the elevator opened. Well that evening i went to jail. And it was in that jail tank, God renewed my spirit. Now i can go to choir rehearsal again without thinking about how much i don't like Andrew, I can still go to church even though two vital families aren't there (Davis's and the Abrahams), i can type this letter to yall, and still not worry how yall might see me later. All i am saying is don't wait until you hit rock bottom to be about God's business again. It's Real good that you Believe in God and you read your Bible. Keep in mind that The devil also belives in God and knows the Bible back wards and forwards, He comes to Steal (Davis's and Abrahams) Kill (Our Spirit) and Destroy (Our Church). Please take heed to what I am saying and I am not saying this because I want to get under yalls skin, i am writing it because i am not holding nothing in anymore, because thats what got my spirits down in the first place. And still much luv, You know how we do it. WWJD","label":0}

The Democratic Party believes that voting is our most fundamental rights and is deeply committed to protecting the right to vote. DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement in light of the new developments in North Carolina: \"While we are disappointed in the U.S. District Court for upholding North Carolina's H.B. 589, the DNC is confident that the courts and the American people will ultimately see these laws for what they are - a cynical political ploy to make it harder for women, people of color, students, the elderly and working families to cast a ballot. These groups of voters represent the Democratic core constituency - and also represent the majority of Americans. \"North Carolina had one of the strongest rates of voter participation in the nation before H.B. 589 was signed into law. The law rolled back the early voting period, eliminated same-day registration, and imposed restrictive photo ID requirements. \"Sadly, North Carolina is joined by several other states making it harder to cast a vote. Make no mistake, this is part of a consistent and concerted effort by Republicans to silence voters who do not agree with the Republicans' extreme agenda. \"As students at a Marquette University polling station faced two hour wait times to vote earlier this month, a Wisconsin Congressman told reporters that the state's restrictive photo ID law would help the GOP defeat Democrats in the fall. That may explain why Republican Senator Ted Cruz recently filed an amicus brief supporting Texas' restrictive photo ID law. \"This is nothing new from Republicans. We all remember just four years ago when the Pennsylvania Republican House Leader announced that the state's restrictive photo ID law was 'gonna allow Governor Romney to win the State of Pennsylvania.' \"There is ample evidence to suggest that these GOP-backed laws are meant to silence the voices of certain segments of our society that are inconvenient to them on Election Day. While Democrats have gone to court in Arizona to reverse this culture of discrimination and disenfranchisement, Republicans are going to court to defend laws designed to decrease voter turnout - because they believe that when fewer people vote, they have a better chance of winning. \"We are fully confident that these laws, like the one passed in Pennsylvania, will ultimately be declared unconstitutional. But our work is never finished. The DNC and Democrats across the nation will not waver in defending the right to vote - the most fundamental of all of our rights.\"","label":0}
{"text":"Mike, Here are my thoughts on the text you sent. Keith will be sending some as well hopefully later today. One important aspect Keith will address is whether you're using the latest Briffa et al curve. We know you're not but the one with the greater low frequency and therefore much better chance of looking much better with the other two series, isn't yet published. We know it looks better in plots we have here. Specifics : p1 line 10 - say mid-19th century rather than the 20th century lines 18-20 - seems a bit too much here with three refs on laminated sediments. line 46 Add Briffa et al (1998b) to Cook(1995). p2 line 59 - I would suggest changing 'a particularly' to 'the most' . line 64 - I would add a reference here to the paper by Crowley and Kim (1999) in GRL (July) where this aspect is also discussed. p3 line 101 - I would add Argentina as well as Chile adding a ref to Villalba (1990 ) in QR. line 108 change 'key' to 'vital' line 119 'have providing' to 'provide' . There are several instances where the text doesn't read that well. I suspect as there are several iterations to go it is not that important yet ! The coral section is just about the right size now and is justly devoid of references ! p4 line 151 I would add a reference here to Morgan and van Ommen (1997) 'Seasonality in late-Holocene climate from ice core records', The Holocene 7, 351-4. This is the Law Dome core which is the best available with regards to dating in either hemisphere. It should be there. As with the coral section the ice core section expresses some cautionary notes with regard to dating etc which I think are justified. I suspect teh contrast with the tree-ring section will draw some criticism. Just a warning ! As none of the multiproxy reconstuctions use any sediment information this section seems overlarge and could be reduced. p189 century-scale add in the 'y' p5 The borehole section is also a bit overlong. I don't know whether the map really adds something. Not that vehement on this. With respect to comapring high and low frequency aspects the diagram comparing CET with the UK boreholes is now out. I've sent a copy to Chris. It is in : Jones PD, 1999 : Classics in physical geography revisited - Manley's CET series. Progress in Physical Geography 23, 425-428. line 245 the 'is' is not needed. p6 I still think that a reference to Raper et al (1996) would be good here. This models a glacier in northern Sweden using the northern Fennoscandian temperature reconstructions since AD 500. Again it shows how a low frequency estimate (the glacial snout position) can be compared with a high-frquency temperature reconstruction from trees. Raper, SCB, Briffa KR and Wigley TML, 1996: Glacial change in northern Sweden from AD 500: a simple geometric model of Storglaciaren. Journal of Glaciology 42, 341-351. line 268 IPCC(1996) earlier - is it 95 or 96 p 7 line 295 I would like to add my paper in Reviews of Geophysics in 1999 as that also says that 1998 was likely to be the warmest year of the millennium. line 334 I would like to see Bradley (1999). I must get a copy from Ray in Venice. p7-9 All need a careful read through for English and the arguments. At the bottom of p8 I think you make too much of the differences in the ranking of the centuries. The boreholes would agree with my series with the 17th being colder than the 19th, although they may not be able to resolve the timescales then. Is the Crowley and Lowery (1999) the paper Tom's submitted to Ambio ? I've not commented much on this final section as again I suspect there are many things you will have to justify in the next two sets of reviews. On the whole I think most is OK and I support the final paragraph. I don't believe the astronomical argument as an explaination over the last 1000 years but we can differ on that. I know I would have written this final section 2.3.3 somehat differently with different emphases and slants but the basic final conclusion would have been the same.

{"text":"Dear Keith, you've done a great job on the touchy subject of the last millennium, which is central to our whole chapter. My comments to that are threefold: (1) If you could shorten the text somewhat, it could become more powerful (2) Some small edits & comments are in the attached doc (3) I propose some improvements to the figures as follows. - Fig 1a the land temps seem to go off plot, temperature scale needs to be extended - we need a break between panels a and the rest, since it's a different time scale on the x axis - Fig 1c also has one curve going off the top - Panels 1b-d might run the time axis up to 2010 or so, else the important rise at the end is hidden in the tick-marks and less obvious than it should be - the legends need to say what the baseline period (zero line of y-axis) is (hard to find this in the axis label) - this baseline should be the same for all curves, i.e. 1961-1990. Fig 2d says 1901-1960 - it's not ideal to have a different one, as compared to Fig 1. Also, is it true? Surely the Storch curve is not shown relative to this baseline, it's way above it. Aligning it like this could lead to the dangerous misunderstanding that Storch suggests a much warmer medieval time compared to everyone else, which of course is not the case. I hope this helps.

{"text":"Phillip, This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event. The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9\/30\/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. Please let me know you preference.

Paul LePage, Donald Trump cannot be trusted to serve as the commander-in-chief of our armed forces,\" said Chairman Bartlett. \"We need a leader who will unite, rather than divide us with vitriolic rhetoric that alienates women and minorities. I call upon Sen. Susan Collins and Congressman Bruce Poliquin to join Republican leaders such as Gov. Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain in clearly, unequivocally denouncing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\" Reuters reported yesterday that Sen. Collins said she had not \"foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting\" Trump, and in an opinion column published this week in the Portland Press Herald, Alan Caron asked whether Sen. Collins could \"find the kind of courage that Margaret Chase Smith displayed when challenging Joseph McCarthy?\" In March, when asked by a reporter whether he would appear with Trump in Maine, Congressman Poliquin allowed \"an uncomfortable pause \" to hang in the air as he waited for an elevator. In a Facebook post yesterday , Gov. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, called Trump's refusal to release his tax returns \"disqualifying.\" ### If you would like to be removed from this distribution list, please reply to this email with the word \"remove\". -- Katie Baker, Communications Director Maine Democratic Party kbaker@mainedems.org Cell: 740-485-1125 Twitter: @muckrakerbaker","label":0}

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. Warrick Dunn , RB TB - TexOK Updated 12\/28\/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - McKay Updated 12\/28\/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver. Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. Steve McNair , QB TEN - McKay Updated 12\/28\/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 12\/28\/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. Joe Horn , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17. Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 12\/28\/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury.

Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's \"full strength\" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - The Rocks Updated 12\/28\/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. \"Still questionable,\" coach Bill Cowher said. \"He did more today.

We'll take it day to day.\" Doug Brien , K IND - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. Ahman Green , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report , Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings.

Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Top Dogs Updated 12\/27\/01 Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season.

{"text":"Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly oppose Sen. Pat Toomey's obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination. Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released its first television ad. The 30-second spot showcases Sen. Toomey's (R-PA) unprecedented refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee and calls on Sen. Toomey to put the Constitution before his politics. The ad will air in the Philadelphia media market over the Senate recess. Additionally, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in conjunction with the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of Pennsylvania voters conducted by Hart Research. The survey found that Pennsylvania voters support giving Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote and strongly disapprove of the positon Senate Republican leadership has taken on this matter. \"This poll shows that Pennsylvanians strongly believe that Senator Toomey and others must give the president's nominee both a fair hearing and a timely vote, and LCV members couldn't agree more. Nearly 150,000 of them have signed a petition calling on the Senate to do its job, including nearly 5,000 in Pennsylvania alone,\" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters. A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey's findings and polling method can be found HERE . Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League of Conservation Voters survey include: * By a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent, Pennsylvania voters say the Senate should hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote. * Independent voters agree with this position by an event larger margin - 60 percent to 36 percent. * After voters hear the pros and cons on Senator Toomey's positon on the Supreme Court vacancy, feelings toward him become notably less favorable. * Independents move from a small net positive view of Toomey (24 percent positive, 18 percent negative) to a large net negative opinion of him (24 percent positive, 50 percent negative). * At the start of the survey, 43 percent of voters said they were inclined to vote for Senator Toomey over his Democratic challenger. After being told about his stance on Judge Garland's nomination, 46 percent of voters said they are less likely to support Senator Toomey. * 16 percent of voters said they would be more open to voting for the Democratic challenger as a result of Senator Toomey's opposition to hearings and a vote for Judge Garland. Wisconsin voters do not approve of Sen. Johnson's Supreme Court obstruction. Roll Call reports on a new poll finding that Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) continued refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination runs counter to the values of Wisconsin voters. \"60 percent of likely Wisconsin voters want to see the president and Senate take action to fill the vacancy now... Roughly half of voters felt that by blocking Obama's nominee, senators were \"trying to advance their party's agenda rather than doing what is right for the country.\" After meeting with Chief Merrick Garland yesterday, Sen. Gary Peters lauds his \"impeccable legal credentials. The Detroit News reports: Sen. Peters (D-MI): \"He comes to this nomination with ... impeccable legal credentials. On top of that, he has the benefit of already being confirmed for his current position with broad bipartisan support. So this is the type of candidate that certainly deserves to have a hearing.\"\" Chief Judge Garland is exactly the type of jurist we want on the Court. Former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson writes in the Wall Street Journal : Ted Olson, former U.S. solicitor general: \"Mr. Garland is extraordinarily well qualified...Throughout his career, he has impressed his colleagues and his legal adversaries with his leadership, sense of fairness, and respect for the law. He has been a judge for 19 years and is now chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, considered by many to be the second-most-important court in the country. Scalia and three current justices also served on the D.C. circuit. By temperament, character and qualifications, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Supreme Court. For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garland a good look, a respectful hearing and a vote on the merits.\" Chief Judge Garland will approach the legal issues that face the disability community with thought and care. Michael Waterston, an expert in disability and civil rights law, reviewed Chief Judge Garland's record and found him to be a thoughtful and fair jurist. Michael Waterstone, disability and civil rights law expert: \"How will Justice Garland rule on the important issues facing the disability community - things like whether websites need to be accessible to individuals who are blind, or how far employers need to go in providing accommodations to workers with disabilities, or whether voters with disabilities are entitled to secret and independent ballots, like everyone else? I don't know...But I do feel confident that Justice Garland would approach the questions carefully and thoughtfully, and without a predefined agenda against the rights of people with disabilities.\"[Loyola Law School, 4\/28\/16 ] A look ahead at a sampling of activity by our grassroots allies: SATURDAY 4\/30\/16 Event: #DoYourJob Day of Action canvasses Location: Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Dover, Keene and Portsmouth, NH Time: 9AM local time Host: AUFC-NH, NextGenNH, NH SEIU, PFAW-NH Press Contact: Liz Purdy, 603-731-2200, liz@mepstrategies.com Event: #DoYourJob Sen.

I think a lot depends on where the city is in relation to the sea, large rivers and water bodies as well. I did try and get population figures for London from various times during the 20th century. I found these, but the area of London they referred to kept changing. Getting the areas proved more difficult, as I though population density would be better. Those I could find showed that the area was increasing, so I sort of gave up on it. Whether London is saturated is not clear. The fact that LWC has a bigger UHI than SJP implies that if you did more development around SJP it could be raised. I doubt though that there will be any development in the Mall and on Horseguards Parade! The Nature Geosciences paper looks good - so hope it gets reviewed favourably. It will be a useful thing to refer to, but I can't see it cutting any ice with the skeptics. They think the models are wrong, and can't get to grips with natural variability! Thanks for the CV. I see I'm on an abstract for the Hawaii meeting! Only noticed as it was the last one on your list.

{"text":"folks, I was thinking exactly the same thing. the problems are so unusually fundamental and obvious, as we lay them out, that it does immediately call into suspicion the integrity of the review process. We probably need to take this directly to the chief editor at JGR, asking that this not be handled by the editor who presided over the original paper, as this would represent a conflict of interest. if we are told that is not possible, then we would at least want the chief editor himself to closely monitor the handling of the paper.

I think you should argue that it should be expedited for the reasons of interest by the press.

Add Puerto Rico's debt crisis to the list of issues Donald Trump doesn't understand Vox \u2013 Matthew Yglesias Now that Donald Trump has secured his place as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, the fact that his statements on matters of public policy often don't make sense will be taken much more seriously. The latest example came during yesterday's interview between Trump and CNN's Wolf Blitzer in which, among other things, Blitzer asked Trump about Puerto Rico. You can read our explainer on the Puerto Rico situation here, but the long and short of it is that Puerto Rico owes a ton of money and, due to population loss, it can't pay. Under normal circumstances, a city or county or business in this situation would file for bankruptcy to reduce its debt burden, but the existing bankruptcy code doesn't let Puerto Rico do this. The White House and many congressional Democrats have proposed creating a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico, but Republicans \u2014 at the behest of distressed debt funds that bought up Puerto Rican bonds \u2014 have blocked it. Here's Blitzer trying to ask Trump if he agrees the bankruptcy law should change: WOLF BLITZER: They're prevented from using the bankruptcy laws, Puerto Rico, as opposed to all the US states. You've used those bankruptcy laws over the years. DONALD TRUMP: I'm the king \u2014 I understand. By the way \u2014 WOLF BLITZER: Should Puerto Rico have an opportunity to use the bankruptcy laws? DONALD TRUMP: As a very successful person I would buy companies, throw them in a chapter, bankrupt it, negotiate \u2014 I would do great deals, I didn't use them for myself, I used them as a businessperson. Many of the top people in my category use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anybody, I love debt. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better than anybody. I will tell you with Puerto Rico they have too much debt. You can't just restructure; you have to use the laws, cut the debt way down, and get back to business, because they can't survive with the kind of debt they have. I would not bail out if I were \u2014 if I were in that position I wouldn't bail them out. WOLF BLITZER: Would you let them have a bankruptcy option? DONALD TRUMP: They're going to have no choice. if they're not going to pay the bill they're not going to pay the interest on the bonds \u2014 WOLF BLITZER: They can't. DONALD TRUMP: They can't. You can't \u2014 you know, the expression you can't take it out of the grave if they don't have it. Whether they officially declare or not, but ultimately what they have to do is cut the debt way down. They're never going to pay that debt off, they have to cut it way down, and the United States is going to be in that position very soon because they have too much debt. Trump is so busy here being defensive about his business record that he's not understanding what the question is. He seems to think that Puerto Rico legally can file for bankruptcy and the problem is they haven't done so, and that what they need is a smarter leader\/negotiator at the helm who can clean up the balance sheet the way he would have in one of his real estate deals. But the whole political issue is that a) Puerto Rico can't do this, legally speaking, and b) the political party that Trump leads is blocking the Obama administration from changing the law. But Trump has no idea what's going on and doesn't seem to be listening to Blitzer's questions. It's easy to go numb to these kinds of things, roll your eyes at pedantic coverage, and say Trump's success so far shows voters don't care about small details like whether or not the president has any idea what he's talking about. But the fact of the matter is that very few people vote in primaries at all, and lots of people don't pay much attention to early campaign coverage. The fact that Trump repeatedly shows up to interviews totally unprepared to discuss the issues of the day in an informed manner and proceeds to wing it in an inconsistent and ideologically unpredictable way is important, and people need to keep hearing about it.

{"text":"I am leaving for my court date in MN. in a couple minutes. Call me on my cell in about 2 hours or anytime in the next day or 2. We have not failed and the reason most of the other groups hate us only started after the kikes started calling us the largest WP group in America. That is it pure and simple jealousy, anyone who says different is a liar. The NSM was well liked even with the uniforms when we were a smaller group. Yes, the uniform change will bring us more support, and yes we still are and will continue to be the largest WP group, but groveling to the weaker groups will not make them our friends again, their excuses for inaction are due to cowardice in some cases, but most often self centeredness. The NSM or any successfull Movement in our struggle must grow on its own. If others help us, thats great and tthey are welcome, but will we grovel or beg for their help? Fuck no!!! My constant calls for Unity over the years have been looked on in the past as weak, or begging for help. Piss on these so-called Racialists if they refuse to take a stand over what they claim is a uniform, or watch now it will be the black is too militant, or well you guys still wave a swastika, or some other faggotty excuse. I have been doing this for a long time and have seen all the weak ass excuses from these ass clowns. Their cowardice and lack of any action beyond bbq's, showing up for a concert, or hanging out for beers is what has killed the American Movement for years and years. The WP\/NS in Europe love the NSM, but laugh their asses off at most of the groups here and the infighting. They loved that we marched on DC, but when the Europeans march they attract 5 to 10 times our number cuz they have activists in their ranks and will beat the asses of the fags that are only Social Skins, or BBQ Socialites. That is where the problem is, not with us nor our allies that will actually hit the streets, but the weak ass bitches that make up 100's of excuse why their candy asses won't fucking march. Grrrrr, yeah I guess I am a little grumpy today, need to hop in the shower and hit the road, long drive today, so later this afternnoon would be a good time to call me if you want to chat. 88 On 5\/2\/08, William Herring wrote: > > Sir- This man is a goldmine!

The sentence on line 32\/33 that there is general agreement in the evolution of the different proxies is important as there is in general much confusion about this and this is a chapter 6 statement covering the whole millennium. The sentence also links nicely to the next sentence on line 50. Yes, as agreed in Bergen delete the other parts if chapter 2 indeed is going to cover it. I have not done so in my revision as I wanted to hear what chap 2 is doing before deleting. Peck, in total we will delete 22 line. Note that I have also squezzed out a few line in the sulfur section. Making progress! Regards, Fortunat David Rind wrote: Jonathan, Keith and I discussed this at the meeting; basically what we need to keep is: P. 6-25, lines 25-30, first sentence on line 50, and P. 6-26 the first paragraph (lines 2-7). All the rest is discussed in one form or another in Chapter 2, pp. 55-56. Concerning the volcanic forcing, there isn't nearly as much overlap, and Chapter 6 did not have very much anyway - I think it would be useful to keep what's there, adding just a reference to Chapter 2 (add: \"see also Chapter 2\", at the end of line 26). (I'm assuming that Fig. 6-13a still includes the solar and volcanic forcing). David At 11:40 AM -0600 7\/18\/06, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: Hi David - it's good to know you can get to work before someone, even if they live in Europe. Your plan sounds good, and is it safe to assume that you will be making sure Chap 2 gets the right material from chap 6, and that we can thus pare our discussion of past solar and volcanic forcing down to a minimum? Can you give us an update of what they will not cover that we should (i.e., looking at section 6.6)? Many thanks, Peck Hi All, [It's a sad state of affairs if I'm the one who gets to work sooner! (regardless of the time difference).] What is discussed below is basically what we thought in response to Gavin's comment - that we would basically cross-reference chap 2, where the primary discussion would occur. It's consistent with chapter 2's general discussion of how forcings have changed over time, and would seem odd if chapter 2 left out past solar and volcanic forcing. Chapter 2 should feel free to utilize anything that existed in Chapter 6 on these issues to complement their discussion, if the need arises. Once that is finalized, Chapter 6 can then make the proper cross-references. David At 10:26 AM -0600 7\/18\/06, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: Hi Ricardo - good points. We did discuss this in Bergen, and David Rind (as a Chap 2 CA) was going to help make sure we kept things covered in chap 2, while cutting our solar and volcanic discussions in chap 6.

Perhaps David could comment first since he's at work sooner. Thanks... Best, Peck Hi all! In comment 6-811, Gavin Schmidt points out that our sections 6.6.3.1 Solar forcing 6.6.3.2 Volcanic forcing largely replicate the discussion in Chap. 2 on the same topics. I checked Chap. 2, and they provide a large (almost 8 pages in the SOD) discussion mainly on solar and but also on volcanic forcings. Gavin suggests that only the implementation issues should be discussed in our chapter and leave the most general information in Chapter 2. We can substantially short our section following his advice. Please, find below the outline of the sections in Chap. 2 dealing with solar and volcanic forcings.

{"text":"Comrades, A young lady from the West Coast sent me this article tonight that she wrote for her College paper on a known Political figure (yours truely). She said it was not published in the school paper because it was too controversial for them, but here it is for our readers... *Commander Jeff Schoep* Think of an American champion. Someone who fights for the greater good, a noble cause, and selflessly dedicates their life to better yours. You might think of John Adams, Ronald Reagan, Martin Luther King Jr., or even a military hero such as George Patton. All of these men were not afraid to challenge controversial ideas and would never admit defeat. They were rightly put into history books, and became legends. What we admire about them is their will to fight, and its what makes them heroes. I found a living champion in the city of Detroit, Michigan. His name is Commander Jeff Schoep, an extremely controversial political figure in charge of the largest neo-Nazi group in the United States. The National Socialist Movement is an organization dedicated to the preservation of their \"proud European heritage\" and the creation of a National Socialist Society in America and around the world. As Commander, Schoep over sees the NSM organization, NSM88 Record Label and Radio, New Saxon website, and most recently SS Enterprise. By now, its obvious why Commander Jeff Schoep holds a position which many would find contentious. NSM has grown considerably since the Schoep took office in 1994, an vital action for the organization whose numbers were dwindling. Since Schoep stepped into the shoes of former Commander Cliff Herrington, he has taken a staggering amount of poor publicity. The endless supposed \"inside\" editorials \"exposing\" NSM, and with it their Commander seem to be constantly bombarding mainstream America. But numbers don't lie! Under Commander Jeff Schoep NSM has gained in strength, numbers, and their business prospects continue to grow and flourish. It seems NSM is not only resilient but the negative publicity has encouraged people to join their cause, and convince current members to steadily hold fast to their beliefs. This is a direct reflection of the action, leadership and dedication of the Commander. As a leader he not only makes it his career, but his life's purpose to spread his message of unity through a \"greater America\". He religiously signs off as, \"If you're not part of the Solution, you're part of the Problem.\" While he is advocating for his cause, gaining membership and bringing groups of people together under one ideal, obscure \"journalists\" looking for something or someone to slur, attempt to further tear a fragile America apart. Now you tell me who the bad guy is. Maybe you don't agree with his principles, but you have to admit the Commander is persistent in the face of a hostile contradiction. Why hasn't the Commander gotten any positive, or even neutral credit for the work he has done? Do we, as a society only give recognition to those people whose causes we deem \"appropriate\" or \"popular\"? Its more than obvious what the answer is. And its unfortunate because I believe that Commander Jeff Schoep has surely pushed NSM forward against almost impossible odds.

{"text":"right Mike, i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting. my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on their phones, or that people will spend more time w\/images than voice. just that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes things 'big time'. rgds, rob -----Original Message----- From: Mike Masnick Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM To: Rob Shavell Cc: fork@example.com Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??

This does nothing to answer my question. I *do* care about content. Hell, if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, I'd have a different opinion of this. I just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not). While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something? I don't buy it. For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not nearly as often as words. Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and such are games? Because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across. >misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same >thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better >resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant >had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera, >and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of >decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the >photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, SMS >didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its >greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS >traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, >SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle. Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with \"you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this\"). I wasn't saying that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way that \"changed the face of communications\". I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. Sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum. I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. People want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. That's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. The instant view part. I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want \"instant view\", but also \"instant show\". Which is what this service offers. I'm not convinced that most people want \"instant show\". I think people like to package their pictures and show them. That's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but it's just \"nice\" on occasion. I still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method. What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it. I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet. The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened - before the press even gets there. Willing to be proven wrong, Mike PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.","label":0}

{"text":"To the Editor American Liberty Publishers Minneapolis, MN 55418 Dear Sir, Your website ( was recently brought to my attention. On this site, you make the following claims: \"In the Second Assessment Report, Benjamin Santer, lead author of a crucial study, falsified a chart to make it appear to support global warming\u2014a conclusion not supported at all by the original data. But two climatologists, Knappenberger and Michaels, looked up the data and exposed the fraud. Santer said he adjusted the data to make it agree with political policy.\" These claims have no factual basis whatsoever, and are demonstrably libelous. I did not falsify data. I did not commit fraud. I did not - nor have I ever - \"adjusted\" scientific data \"to make it agree with political policy.\" Nor did I ever state that I had made data adjustments in order to conform to political policy. I request that you retract these claims immediately. They are completely fictitious, and are harmful to my scientific reputation. If you do not retract these claims immediately, I will transfer this matter to the attention of legal staff at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

TO: Interested Parties FROM: Lorraine Miller and Jim Roosevelt, Jr., Co-Chairs of the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee REGARDING: An Overview of the Democratic Delegate Selection Process DATE: April 22, 2016 2016 CYCLE OVERVIEW Democrats are excited about the 2016 Democratic primary election season, and that's because we have strong candidates who are dedicated to solving the issues that matter most to Americans. Voters are eager to cast their vote for the next Democratic presidential nominee and participate in the Democratic delegate selection process in their state. Our process aims to uphold our Party's values of inclusivity, diversity, and transparency. Here is the Democratic delegate selection process by the numbers: \u00b7 4,765 = total number of Democratic delegates as of today \u00b7 4,051 = total number of pledged Democratic delegates \u00b7 714 = total number of unpledged delegates \u00b7 2,383 = number of delegate votes needed to win the Democratic nomination as of today \u00b7 57 = the number of presidential nominating contests PROCESS DEVELOPMENT The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee (RBC) reviews the Delegate Selection Rules prior to each presidential election year. While the general structure of the Democratic delegate selection process has been in place since 1972, the Committee, over the course of many public meetings, reflects on the delegate selection process of the previous cycle and updates the Rules accordingly. The RBC met five times in 2014 in order to finalize the Delegate Selection Rules for the 2016 cycle, which were then shared with the 57 state and territory Democratic parties. In May of 2015, each party submitted their Delegate Selection Plan to the RBC. These plans were subsequently reviewed by the Committee to ensure compliance with the DNC's Delegate Selection Rules during the summer of 2015 at three public meetings, attended by press, presidential campaigns, and other interested parties, held on June 26, July 24 and August 27. In partnership with the RBC, DNC staff, and presidential campaigns, state parties work to implement their Delegate Selection Plans starting in September of 2015 until the process draws to a close. While state and territory parties are the drivers of their process, the creation and implementation of their Plans are governed by the DNC's Delegate Selection Rules, the Call for the Convention, and the Regulations of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. These materials provide states and territories with the guidance that ensures fundamental values of the Democratic Party\u2014such as a commitment to diversity and participation of all eligible voters\u2014are upheld throughout this process. For example, each state and territory party solicits public comment on their Plan for no less than 30 days to allow for input from constituents, making the drafting of the Delegate Selection Plan a democratic process. Additionally, each state is required to develop and implement an extensive affirmative action and inclusion outreach plan. The state and territory parties as well as presidential campaigns are tasked with conducting widespread outreach and recruitment to encourage Democrats of all backgrounds to run to be delegates. Our Party believes that our convention should look like America, and state and territory parties and campaigns are responsible for striving to meet that diversity goal. THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATE SELECTION PROCESS VERSUS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS Some stark differences between the Democrats' delegate selection process and the Republican's delegate selection process were mentioned in the previous section, but that's not where the differences end. Outlined below are some major differences between our process and that of the Republicans: \u00b7 A commitment to diversity and equal representation of men and women \u00b7 The solicitation of input from the public during the creation of a state's Delegate Selection Plan \u00b7 The transparent development of our Rules \u00b7 Proportional allocation of pledged delegates to presidential candidates based on the results of the state's primary or caucus o Unlike the Republicans, we do not allow for \"winner-take all\" outcomes, meaning that the candidate who wins the majority vote in a state does not win all of the state's delegates. o Instead, presidential candidates who break threshold, which is 15% in all states, are allocated delegates proportional to the percentage of the vote that they won in the primary or caucus. o Delegates must affirm in writing that they are bona fide supporters of the candidates that they are representing in the delegation and are subject to review by each campaign. o We believe that this is the fairest way to reflect the intention of Democratic voters and to mirror the results at each step in the delegate selection process in the states. \u00b7 Delegates elected in the states are pledged not bound, meaning that they are required only to represent in good faith those who elected them. UNPLEDGED DELEGATES An often discussed feature of the Democratic delegate selection process is the unpledged delegates, also referred to as \"superdelegates.\" These individuals serve by virtue of the elected office that they hold, and they include: \u00b7 Democratic Governors \u00b7 Democratic Members of Congress \u00b7 Distinguished Party Leaders (such as former presidents and former leaders in the Senate and the House) \u00b7 DNC Members We ensure these leaders have a voice in our convention, and their existence as a separate group means that interested voters don't have to run against elected officials in order to attend the Democratic National Convention. Unpledged delegates are also distinguished by the fact that they are not pledged to a presidential candidate based on the results of their state's primary or caucus and instead exercise their best judgment when selecting a presidential candidate to support. Concerns that unpledged delegates may change the outcome of the election are historically unfounded\u2014unpledged delegates have never changed the outcome of an election since unpledged delegates were established over 30 years ago. Like pledged delegates, unpledged delegate cast one vote, which carries the same weight as the vote of any other delegate. There have been recent reports of harassment or mistreatment of state parties who are managing the process in their state and unpledged delegates. This does not reflect the values of this process and our great Party. State Parties are working year round to elect Democrats at every level and are the foundation of our Party. Unpledged delegates have been a feature of our process for many decades and will continue to play a role. We encourage all interested parties, including presidential candidates and members of the press and public, to learn all about their state's process. It is important that our process is open, transparent, and maximizes participation. Each state plan has undergone a rigorous review process to ensure compliance with our Rules, and changing Rules midway through the cycle would lead to confusion among participants in the delegate selection process, unnecessary costs to state parties, and inconsistent standards for states to abide by. Our Party spends years preparing for each presidential election cycle, and we believe that our process is designed to best position our Party and our eventual nominee for victory in the general election in November. We are looking forward to the Democratic National Convention in July where our delegates will cast their vote for the next President of the United States. ---- Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 \u2013 MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC","label":0}

If you receive my voicemail please leave me a message and a number I can reach you. I typically do not answer my phone when I do not recognize the number calling. I also live in the mountains so I do not get signal on my cell when I am at home. I sent a couple of emails to the Colorado POC but have not heard anything back from them. I hope I haven't ruffled any feathers by my emails. I am just tired of the organizations that represent the white race not having the foresight to actually take some action to work toward our goals or some of these idiots who cannot speak intelligently or persuasively and try to take stupid actions that actually hurt our \"cause\" instead of helping it. A lot of these organizations are political dinosaurs and they need to either evolve or stay out of the way of those who actually want to accomplish goals for our race. Anyway, I always speak my mind until I see I shouldn't speak my mind. I hope I haven't angered some in the NSM but if I have, tell them to give me some of their time and I'll convince them I am right. I convinced a black the other day that society is better when it is segmented into sections of ethnicity so I figure I should be able to convince my own race of the same. Of course, my plans and ideas are little bit more drastic but not much. I hope to hear from you or the Commander soon. 88 Jeff Heuermann","label":0}

{"text":"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE The National Socialist Movement, the nation's largest White Rights organization, was in full force this past weekend in Washington, DC. On the lawn of the United States Capitol Building, a new step was taken in advancing the cause that the NSM has fought for since 1974. Brian Holland, an NSM member and 20 year veteran of the White Rights Movement, announced that he had accepted the Party's nomination for President of the United States. Holland, an award winning former journalist, 17 year veteran radio talk show host, television producer, and longtime supporter of the Movement, announced briefly that he would be seeking the Presidency. In a brief interview after the NSM's National Rally, Holland explained the cornerstones of his candidacy: \"This nation and this world needs leadership that is prepared to face the real issues, the real problems. The United States needs to see its interest rates dropped and held at a reasonable rate. We need to make it possible for those that need to be provided for are indeed provided for. We need to guarantee this nation's freedoms, regardless of your stand or your beliefs, we need to guarantee that you have the right to express it peacefully. This nation needs to develop a real plan to end the quagmire in Iraq, and to bring our brave men and women home from battle. Taxation needs to be overhauled, and we need to follow the examples of the former Soviet Bloc nations who have implemented a flat tax for all citizens. Those former Easter Bloc nations are now flourishing because of their fair and equal taxation system. Our borders need to be protected at all costs. Borders, language, and culture needs to be the backbone of our efforts. Crime has to be met face to face, and stopped at all costs. Illegal aliens need to be returned to their homelands. One out of every three inmates in our Federal Prison System is an illegal alien, they are not our responsibility. America is not the world's police force, and I will not allow it to be. We are not at the disposal of every third world nation that needs us to bail them out, then when the work is done, they return to their America hating ways. No more. Education, real education, must be returned to the people. The protection of the American family. These are the things that haunt me, and the reasons that I have proudly accepted my Party's nomination for the Presidency of the United States of America. With the efforts of Commander Schoep and the help of our supporters worldwide, these goals can be met. It is important to remember, this is not about hate, it is not about the blame game, it is about preservation, heritage, culture, it is indeed about the future.\" The campaign will begin full swing in May, with Holland visiting supporters in Arizona, Florida, and Oregon. Future campaign information will be provided on the soon to be published official website.

{"text":"In the first place Mr. Cook why don't you BCC your list so your people have a bit of privacy. You might as well send your list directly to the FBI.I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you but I will respond to your points. First of all the methods you are using have and were being used for decades without any significant success. I ought to know I used them back in the 60's,and 70's. You go into the streets protected by system cops. Your best people are exposed to loss of jobs,wives and even lives at the hands of pimple faced social Marxists who buy into your same methods only they don't need to march. They just wait to hear you are gathering. Believe me Mr. Barret is a little of both opportunist and nut.Plus another point that I am not going to get into. Would any sane White man walk around New York City with a cotton ball on his hat? Barret is insignificant anyway. Don't be so foolish as to compare our problem to Hitlers. Its like comparing apples to oranges.However he did start out recruiting FREEBOOTERS who were veterans,out of work white people and if you will hooligans capable of breaking heads and assasination if needed. I would think you would teach your associates to be more like Ben Klassen and not Uncle Adolph.Ben Klassen invented things,worked for a while in politics also real estate.After he amassed his wealth he saw the light and spent hundreds of thousands of his own money not members money to create a foundation to begin with. Then he authored books that we still hold dear. I never saw Ben march in any parades or role around in the streets with White trash social Marxists and other rabble.I dont remember him advocating it. Don't look now but a great many Creators are and were Skinheads. If you insist on going into the streets you better speak a little more kindly of your creator skinheads. Remember they will fight and defend your white ass. Most others will run like rabbits.So I would use that word cowardly with a little more reserve if I were you. Unless it skipped your notice Mat Hale is in prison doing 40 years primarily because he was young brash and arrogant.I tried to council Mat several times about where the line is but he insisted on crossing the line. Also normal organizational practices like having a chief of security its suicide and is only show anyhow.Most of them as much about security as a 10 year old kid. I am talking through expereance not theory. Back in the day when I played the game your way security positions were the most sought after positions for informants,cops etc. My first chief of security turned out to be A San Diego PD reserve police officer. We outed him early but he still did some damage. I am sure Mat never gave lie detector tests or strip search his officers before serious discussions.The loss of 40 years of income as an attorney would have allowed Mat to hire the best private detective company in the country to keep things clean. Don't get me wrong ,I only advise. If people don't like my advice they do like you and just say shove it in capital letters. I am very used to that.lol Your case holds a few options. You will go into the streets or libraries and you will be attacked by both cops and the rabble who have less power than you do politically. People get hurt possibly fatal or jailed. Jobs lost etc.Since this is the same tactics other groups use you will gradually lose good people. Then you will fight with all the other little groups for members. In the end you will burn out,quit,or become one of the several similar personalities that are on the ADL,SPLC,Simon Weisenthal Center speakers tour. I regret that Mat Hale is in prison since its such a waste but he like many other people in Prison failed to seek wise council and now regrets it. Good luck Mr. Cook but remember my words.

JE: There is a part of the out-boarding process you are reminded of the commitments that you made on the way in that would limit your job prospects on the way out. And look, many people have raised concerns about how historically there has been a revolving door between the federal government and K Street and POTUS' efforts that he initiated on his first day in office closed that revolving door, both in terms of people it has on people entering the government, but also based on restrictions that people committed to on their way out. Susan: It's not just K Street that people are going to. If anyone left the WH that wanted to lobby on behalf of engagement in Cuba, should they have registered to lobby? JE: Well again, it seems like you are talking about a specific case and I can walk you through the specific case. Susan: Luis Miranda left the WH and he went to the 'Trinlin' Group. From what I understand he did contact and engage the WH on that issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there were no lobbying records to show for that. I have notes on this, but there has been a lot of discussion about that narrative this week (Iran), but there was little to no discussion about the Cuba timeline. I want to know the transparency on those negotiations. So that's what I am asking about. JE: Let's take a look and see if we can provide you with additional information, but I don't think that any of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a look. Susan: To Luis Miranda specifically? JE: He doesn't work here anymore. Contact him. Susan: Right, so, that's why I am asking. I tried to contact him. Is it important for the WH to have some level, on the Cuba issue, surprise on that issue? Is the WH right to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a major initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another country? JE: Yeah, that is appropriate and it applies to other breakthroughs that the US has achieved in recent years. We were negotiating to secure the release of Americans that were unjustly held in Iran. That is not something that we discussed extensively in the past. When the US worked behind the scenes in China to fight for climate change, the results of those negotiations were criticized by many in the public. But, the US enjoyed great benefits in the end. Those type of negotiations are most effective when they are done behind the scenes.","label":0}

{"text":"Rashit that sounds great - at least I am happy you are working on the sub fossil material still. I have done some work comparing the Swedish and Finnish long series after standard RCS detrending and there is good similarity at the century timescale for some considerable periods - but significant differences over some others , even allowing for uncertainty in the series These are only 300 km separated so this is an interesting indication of changes in continentality perhaps. I am also interested in extending the high-frequency density series before 1400 AD , to show earlier volcanoes , even though the spatial coverage is poor. It would be interesting to see your extreme year series - do you have a preprint of your paper? I would really like to get support to continue a wider collaboration , including other northern long series to produce wide scale integrated series . What is the latest state of your tree-line reconstruction , for periods earlier than you showed in the Holocene paper?

Stepan has been updated his woody vegetation descriptions in the Polar Urals to reconstruct dynamics of forest structure near upper timberline for the last century. Because of some reasons (sometimes without any reasons) the work on constructing Yamal chronology is going not very well. Duration of chronology is now 7315 years (7314 BC - AD 2000). The last valuable field work has been realized in 2000, when we have collected 370 subfossil samples. Half of them have been dated. Now I successfully collect money for field work (for helicopter rent). I hope this field season will be fruitful. Meantime we have analyzed frost- and light-ring frequency in Yamal tree rings for the last 2100 years to reconstruct extreme events. The later half of this reconstruction, I hope, will be published this year in Palaeo3.

{"text":"Quick draft quote in response: \"Donald Trump is the candidate that will Make America Hate Again. Trump's racist, xenophobic candidacy continues to fuel a resurgence of white nationalism in the United States, and to elevate a man like this shows that Trump has neither the temperament nor judgment to serve as President.\" From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 4:05 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Mother Jones: Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California h\/t Joel We have a fair amount on William Johnson and his Pro-Trump American National Super PAC running robocalls in Iowa Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California On Monday evening, California's secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the Trump campaign for the upcoming Republican presidential primary in the state. Trump's slate includes William Johnson, one of the country's most prominent white nationalists. Johnson applied to the Trump campaign to be a delegate. He was accepted on Monday. In order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign: \"I, William Johnson, endorse Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States. I pledge to cast ALL of my ballots to elect Donald J. Trump on every round of balloting at the 2016 Republican National Convention so that we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" After he signed, the Trump campaign added his name to the list of 169 delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state. Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that \"exists to represent the political interests of White Americans\" and aims to preserve \"the customs and heritage of the European American people.\" The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is \"arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,\" according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups. Johnson got the news that he had been selected by Trump in a congratulatory email sent to him by the campaign's California Delegate Coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino. \"I just hope to show how I can be mainstream and have these views,\" Johnson tellsMother Jones. \"I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody.\" Johnson says that in his application to be a GOP delegate for Trump he disclosed multiple details about his background and activism, though he did not specifically use the term \"white nationalist.\" The Trump campaign and Lagomarsino did not respond to requests for comment. Whether or not Johnson was vetted by the Trump campaign, the GOP front-runner would have a hard time claiming ignorance of Johnson's extreme views: Johnson has gained notice during the presidential primary for funding pro-Trump robocalls that convey a white nationalist message. \"The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called 'racist,'\" Johnson says in one robocall pushed out to residential landlines in Vermont and Minnesota. \"...Donald Trump is not racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don't vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\" Armed with cash from affluent donors and staffed by what the movement considers to be its top thinkers, the AFP now dedicates most of its resources to supporting Trump-and for good reason: Johnson claims the AFP's pro-Trump robocalls, which have delivered Johnson's personal cellphone number to voters in seven states, have helped the party find hundreds of new members. \"[Trump] is allowing us to talk about things we've not been able to talk about,\" Johnson says. \"So even if he is not elected, he has achieved great things.\" On numerous occasions, Trump has failed to forcefully repudiate this sort of support. After being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in August last year, Trump simply told Bloomberg News, \"I don't need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn't want his endorsement. I don't need anybody's endorsement.\" Asked in February about the robocalls, which are funded by Johnson through a super-PAC, a Trump spokeswoman would only tell CNN that the candidate had \"disavowed all super-PACs offering their support.\" The SPLC's Potok argues that Trump has \"legitimized and mainstreamed hate\" in ways we haven't seen since the days of George Wallace. Though nobody can say for sure how many people belong to America's largest hate groups, the SPLC has found that the number of such groups grew by 14 percent in 2015, reversing years of declines. Potok worries that Trump could fuel the spread of the AFP's ideas for years to come. Johnson is a corporate lawyer who grows persimmons and raises chickens at his 67-acre \"ranch\" in a Los Angeles suburb. When I met him recently outside his law office in downtown LA's World Trade Center, he was in high spirits. He suggested brightly that we walk downstairs to get lunch at a nearby Korean restaurant. As we sat next to a table of immaculately coiffed Korean Air flight attendants, I mentioned that some might find it surprising that a guy who wrote a book advocating the creation of an all-white ethno-state was eating a plate of bulgogi beef with kimchee. \"Koreans don't have to make Korean food,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"One of the best Chinese restaurants I went to in the Bay Area is owned by a Mormon and cooked by a Mormon. Really great Chinese food.\" Short, graying, and 61 years old, Johnson favors pressed white shirts and bookish black-framed glasses. He grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods in Arizona and Oregon before moving to Japan in 1974 to study the language. It was there that locals engaged him in \"open\" discussions about differences between the races, and he came to see America's European heritage as its biggest-and most vulnerable-asset. (This trajectory is not uncommon: Jared Taylor, head of the white nationalist group American Renaissance, also speaks fluent Japanese, and Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler became a white supremacist while immersed in the caste system in India.) In 1985, Johnson published, under a pseudonym, Amendment to the Constitution: Averting the Decline and Fall of America, a book calling for the abolition of the 14th and 15th Amendments and the deportation of all nonwhites. He tried to sound a practical tone, allowing, for instance, that African Americans should receive \"a rich dowry to enable them to prosper in their homeland.\" The book was a hit on the talk show circuit, and Johnson suddenly found himself appearing on television alongside neo-Nazi skinheads and Klansmen. By 1989, his notoriety and clean-cut appeal convinced a group of white nationalists in Wyoming to tap him to run for Dick Cheney's vacant congressional seat. He garnered a flurry of press coverage when he earned enough signatures to qualify for the ballot; around the same time, the building housing his California law office was bombed. Johnson says the FBI accused him of detonating it himself in a bid for more press. (The bureau declined to comment.) Twenty years later, after unsuccessfully running for various other offices, Johnson became the head of the American Freedom Party (then known as American Third Position), at the request of a group of Southern California skinheads. Johnson's post was supposed to be temporary: \"The skinheads thought I was too extreme to run the organization,\" he explained. But they were the ones who ended up dropping out, replaced by what has become a sort of white nationalist brain trust: Party leaders now include a former Reagan administration appointee and a professor emeritus at California State University-Long Beach. After our Korean lunch, Johnson rushed back up to his office to host the latest episode of For God and Country, a Christian AM talk show currently broadcast in California, Louisiana, and Texas. His Filipino American co-host, the Rev. Ronald Tan, nodded approvingly as Johnson praised Trump on the air for \"busting up the concept of political correctness.\" The show allows Johnson to push a Trump-centric version of white nationalism to a potentially receptive audience-up to a point. Several radio stations in Iowa recently canceled the program out of objection to its content. During a commercial break, Johnson fidgeted. \"Are you going to quote any more Scriptures?\" he asked Tan nervously. \"Has the station said that we're not Christian enough?\" Back on the air, Tan pivoted to 1 Samuel 16, comparing Trump to King David. In addition to promoting Trump on the radio and over the phone, the AFP streams a podcast called the Daily Trump Phenomenon Hour. It has set up a \"political harassment hotline\" for Trump supporters who wish to consult with an attorney about being attacked or verbally abused by anti-Trump protesters. Johnson has personally spent $30,000 the Trump promotions, including $18,000 for the party. The robocalls, the radio show, and the \"harassment hotline\" were all things that Johnson mentioned in his application to become a Trump delegate. He specifically cited an anti-Romney robocall commissioned in Utah this past March, which begins, in part, \"My name is William Johnson. I am a farmer and a white nationalist.\" After wrapping up the radio show, Johnson led me through his office, where a brush-painted screen hangs alongside shelves stacked with Japanese books and dictionaries. Many of his legal clients, it turns out, are foreigners who speak English as a second language. Yet Johnson says he sees no problem with Trump's isolationist foreign policy, even if it hurts his business-ideally, he'd like to give up his practice and serve as Trump's secretary of agriculture. We ended up in a mirrored conference room to meet with three AFP sympathizers, two middle-aged women and a young man. They talked about how Trump had enabled a new kind of \"honest discourse,\" how he wasn't a racist but a \"racialist,\" and how he had left them feeling \"emancipated.\" Johnson also now finds it easier to be himself: \"For many, many years, when I would say these things, other white people would call me names: 'Oh, you're a hatemonger, you're a Nazi, you're like Hitler,'\" he confessed. \"Now they come in and say, 'Oh, you're like Donald Trump.'\"","label":0}

Let me know if you have any flags. Sender: 2016 DNC Factivists Subject: Hey there, NAME - After another week of getting used to the idea of Donald Trump as their party's presumptive nominee, Republicans are now trying to convince the rest of us that there's nothing out of the ordinary about Trump's candidacy and that supporting him is business as usual. We'll be blunt: There is noting nothing typical about Donald Trump or the campaign he's running. Typical candidates are held to certain standards of decency. Not Trump. Typical candidates are expected to release their tax returns or risk facing serious questions from the press and voters. Not Trump. Typical candidates understand there are certain lines we don't cross as Americans. Not Trump. Donald Trump is a uniquely dangerous candidate, and we can't forget that. As President Obama put it: As Factivists, it's our job to get the word out about just how high the stakes are this November and how important it is that we elect Democrats to stop Trump and his fellow Republicans. So please retweet and help us spread the facts. Thanks for playing your part, NAME. Talk to you next week. 2016 DNC Factivists","label":0}

The Ohio National Socialist Movement is going to change that. *WE*are taking a stand against the politically correct, manipulated schools system and publication industry that chooses to pollute our children and * our* lives with this misguided and deceptive agenda. The Meeting will take place March 1st at 4 p.m. in Lewisburg, OH. We will carpool to a public awareness meeting. From there we will proceed to a private location for the book burning. Afterwards we will go to a meeting hall for refreshments and hot chow.

An example: Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a metro area when deploying wireless networks. By having every single tree and building detail and similar, you can \"see\" even tiny dead spots due to physical blockage and signal attenuation. Overlay this with fiber map data for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth. Take that and tie it into a slick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and management system and you've really got something... For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com","label":0}

The Sanders campaign had been hoping for a significant role at the Democratic convention, but Wasserman Schultz has picked 75 members of the convention's key committees -- rules, credentials and platform \u2013 and accepted only 3 of Bernie's choices, failing to acknowledge the proportion of the vote Bernie has won in the primaries and caucuses. Negotiations with the DNC have failed to add any additional Bernie picks to any of the standing committees. Worse yet, she's named as chairs Hillary backers known for their harsh criticism of Bernie (among them Barnie Frank, as co-chair of the influential Rules Committee). \"This is insider politics run amok, at the very time and in the very election that insider politics is disdained \u2013 and at the very moment it's vitally important to unite the Democratic Party. How can Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC be so obtuse? What do you think?\" If we thought the Nevada Democratic Convention was bad, imagine what will go down at the National Convention with staunch Bernie opponents like Barnie Frank running something as crucial as the rules committee. \"The deck is stacked against us,\" says Reich. \"What do we plan to do if the National Convention ends up as big of a corrupt shit show as Nevada?

{"text":"Oh but not yesterday or today. That's from Friday. ________________________________ From: Palermo, Rachel Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 10:14 AM To: Miranda, Luis Subject: RE: Daniel STrauss Politico? Sanders accuses DNC of tipping convention toward Clinton By DANIEL STRAUSS Bernie Sanders is accusing Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of trying to tip the party convention in Hillary Clinton's favor, saying the chairwoman has packed the committees with Clinton supporters. In a letter to the chairwoman, Sanders noted that of the 45 names he submitted to Democratic National Convention committees, Wasserman Schultz appointed only three. \"I believe the composition of the standing committees must reflect the relative support that has been received by both campaigns,\" Sanders wrote in the letter dated May 6. \"That was why I was so disappointed to learn that of the over forty people our campaign submitted at your request you chose to select only three of my recommendations for the three standing committees. Moreover, you did not assign even on of the people submitted by our campaign to the very important Rules Committee of the Democratic National Convention.\" Sanders said that if the disagreement over convention committee appointments is not resolved, he would have his delegates move to change the platform on the floor of the convention. \"It is my hope we can quickly resolve this in a fair way,\" Sanders wrote. \"If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention.\" Sanders' chances of taking the Democratic nomination have decreased, as he has a deep disadvantage in both pledged and superdelegates. But the insurgent candidate has vowed to continue on, and his deep run into the primary gives him additional leverage to pull the party to the left. In his letter, Sanders also mentioned the Democratic Party platform drafting committee. In the letter he recounted Wasserman Schultz had discussed changing the process for selecting members of the committee. \"In our conversation, you told me with respect to the platform Drafting Committee that you would consider allowing each campaign to submit ten names from which you would choose four from each and then you would add an additional seven,\" Sanders continued. \"While having four members on the Drafting Committee is an improvement, it does not address the fact that up to this point Bernie 2016 has secured 45% of the pledged delegates awarded. Frankly, we believe that percentage will go up in the coming weeks and, of course, we hope it will end up being a majority.\" Sanders argued that each campaign should be able to pick seven members for the committee with the fifteenth member being one picked by both campaigns. \"This process will also ensure that the chairs of the standing committees conduct their proceedings with fairness and transparency,\" Sanders argued. In its response to Sanders letter, the DNC released a statement saying both campaigns would be represented at the convention. \"Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process,\" the DNC said in a statement. \"Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate\" -- [DNC] Rachel Palermo Democratic National Committee PalermoR@dnc.org 202-863-8041 From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 10:12 AM To: Palermo, Rachel Subject: Daniel STrauss Politico?

{"text":"Sorry this kept you awake...but I have also found it a rather alarming graph. First, a disclaimer\/explanation. The graph patches together 3 things: Mann et al NH mean annual temps + 2 sigma standard error for AD1000-1980, + instrumental data for 1981-1998 + IPCC (\"do not quote, do not cite\" projections for GLOBAL temperature for the next 100 years, relative to 1998. The range of shading represents several models of projected emissions scenarios as input to GCMs, but the GCM mean global temperature output (as I understand it) was then reproduced by Sarah Raper's energy balance model, and it is those values that are plotted. Keith pointed this out to me; I need to go back & read the IPCC TAR to understand why they did that, but it makes no difference to the first order result....neither does it matter that the projection is global rather than NH....the important point is that the range of estimates far exceeds the range estimated by Mann et al in their reconstruction. Keith also said that the Hadley Center GCM runs are being archived at CRU, so it ought to be possible to get that data and simply compute the NH variability for the projected period & add that to the figure, but it will not add much real information. However, getting such data would allow us to extract (say) a summer regional series for the Arctic and to then plot it versus the Holocene melt record from Agassiz ice cap....or....well, you can see other possiblities. [......At this point Keith Alverson throws up his hands in despair at the ignorance of non-model amateurs...] But there are real questions to be asked of the paleo reconstruction. First, I should point out that we calibrated versus 1902-1980, then \"verified\" the approach using an independent data set for 1854-1901. The results were good, giving me confidence that if we had a comparable proxy data set for post-1980 (we don't!) our proxy-based reconstruction would capture that period well. Unfortunately, the proxy network we used has not been updated, and furthermore there are many\/some\/ tree ring sites where there has been a \"decoupling\" between the long-term relationship between climate and tree growth, so that things fall apart in recent decades....this makes it very difficult to demonstrate what I just claimed. We can only call on evidence from many other proxies for \"unprecedented\" states in recent years (e.g. glaciers, isotopes in tropical ice etc..). But there are (at least) two other problems -- Keith Briffa points out that the very strong trend in the 20th century calibration period accounts for much of the success of our calibration and makes it unlikely that we would be able be able to reconstruct such an extraordinary period as the 1990s with much success (I may be mis-quoting him somewhat, but that is the general thrust of his criticism). Indeed, in the verification period, the biggest \"miss\" was an apparently very warm year in the late 19th century that we did not get right at all. This makes criticisms of the \"antis\" difficult to respond to (they have not yet risen to this level of sophistication, but they are \"on the scent\"). Furthermore, it may be that Mann et al simply don't have the long-term trend right, due to underestimation of low frequency info. in the (very few) proxies that we used. We tried to demonstrate that this was not a problem of the tree ring data we used by re-running the reconstruction with & without tree rings, and indeed the two efforts were very similar -- but we could only do this back to about 1700. Whether we have the 1000 year trend right is far less certain (& one reason why I hedge my bets on whether there were any periods in Medieval times that might have been \"warm\", to the irritation of my co-authors!). So, possibly if you crank up the trend over 1000 years, you find that the envelope of uncertainty is comparable with at least some of the future scenarios, which of course begs the question as to what the likely forcing was 1000 years ago. (My money is firmly on an increase in solar irradiance, based on the 10-Be data..). Another issue is whether we have estimated the totality of uncertainty in the long-term data set used -- maybe the envelope is really much larger, due to inherent characteristics of the proxy data themselves....again this would cause the past and future envelopes to overlap. In Ch 7 we will try to discuss some of these issues, in the limited space available. Perhaps the best thing at this stage is to simply point out the inherent uncertainties and point the way towards how these uncertainties can be reduced. Malcolm & I are working with Mike Mann to do just that. I would welcome other thoughts and comments on any of this!

{"text":"Warwick, I did not think I would get a chance today to look at the web page. I see what boxes you are referring to. The interpolation procedure cannot produce larger anomalies than neighbours (larger values in a single month). If you have found any of these I will investigate. If you are talking about larger trends then that is a different matter. Trends say in Fig 2.9 for the 1976-99 period require 16 years to have data and at least 10 months in each year. It is conceivable that at there are 24 years in this period that missing values in some boxes influence trend calculation. I would expect this to be random across the globe. Cheers Phil Warwick, Been away. Just checked my program and the interpolation shouldn't produce larger anomalies than the neighbouring cells. So can you send me the cells, months and year of the two cells you've found ? If I have this I can check to see what has happened and answer (1). As for (2) and (3) we compared all stations with neighbours and these two stations did not have problems when the work was done (around 1985\/6). I am not around much for the next 3 weeks but will be here most of this week and will try to answer (1) if I get more details. If you have the names of stations that you've compared Olenek and Verhojansk with I would appreciate that.

{"text":"APRIL 24, 2016 - DONALD J. TRUMP RESPONSE TO CRUZ AND KASICH CAMPAIGNS It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination. Senator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance, which was a total disaster, he is in free fall and as everyone has seen, he does not react well under pressure. Also, approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him. Governor Kasich, who has only won 1 state out of 41, in other words, he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so. Marco Rubio, as an example, has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago. Others, likewise, have done much better than Kasich, who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin. 85% of Republican voters are against Kasich. Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are. I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich. Additionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me. Because of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged. When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters, (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system. This horrible act of desperation, from two campaigns who have totally failed, makes me even more determined, for the good of the Republican Party and our country, to prevail!","label":0}

We are the largest most active NS group in America. Drug usage or criminal activities by any member results in IMMEDIATE dismissal from the party.

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%) FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%). Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces. Thanks, Monika Causholli ext. 5-1510","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Colleagues, This is a follow up on the earlier announcement of the next SRES Meeting. First, I would like to thank all those of you who have confirmed that you will join us in Beijing. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues also had to cancel due to other commitments. Attached you will find the venue of the meeting and hotel that Dadi reserved for us at a special discounted price. My proposal is to convene at 13:00 hours on 7 October and try to finish on early afternoon on 9 October so that you have some free time left for sight-seeing before we all depart. I will soon send to all of you formal invitation letters on IIASA letter-head just in the case you need it for travel approval (unless you cancel your participation in the meantime). Dadi will send you a similar invitation letter to use in order to obtain a visa for China. Appended is my last e-mail concerning this meeting in case you did not receive a copy. In the attachment to this e-mail you will find two letters. One is from IPCC outlining the possible role of scenarios in IPCC assessment (Microsoft Photo Editor file). It is important for our work as it indicates possible uses of new IPCC emissions scenarios. One of the agenda items at the meeting will indeed be to discuss which of our marker scenarios we recommend be used in the interim period before our scenarios are approved by IPCC in early 2000. The other letter is also from IPCC announcing the SRES web-site (PowerPoint file). The web-site includes most of the scenario variants we have developed to date. Please circulate this second letter as widely as you can because we need as much feedback from the wider community of possible users as we can obtain. Please let us know as soon as possible whether you are planing to attend. I hope to see you all in China. Regards, Naki Venue: National Meteorological Administration (No. 46 Baishiqiao Road, Haidian District, Beijing). Accommodation: Olympic Hotel (No. 48 Baishiqiao Road, Haidian District, Beijing, Tel: 086-10-62176688); discounted Price: US$65+15% service costs. Meeting Announcement: Dear Colleagues, Zhou Dadi has been kind enough to organize the next SRES Lead Authors meeting in Beijing, China, to be held on 7-9 October, 1998. Dadi will provide us with more detailed information on meeting logistics in the near future, and I will send out a meeting agenda as we get closer to the meeting date. Basically, there are four items that need to be discussed at the meeting: 1) SRES progress to date; 2) the open process; 3) scenario revisions and additional work; and 4) planning the final report. Please mark you calendars for this date and RSVP to both Zhou Dadi (becon@public3.bta.net.cn) and Anne Johnson (johnson@iiasa.ac.at) as soon as possible I will be out of the office 10-26 September and will not be able to receive messages during this time. I look forward to seeing you in Beijing. Naki","label":0}
{"text":"Hey Keith, I hope your visit w\/ your family went well... I went ahead and tried to make some constructive comments on what you sent (figured it would be nice to get this out of the way before the holidays come round).. Let me say I think it's shaping up very nicely--looks like it should be a significant improvement on the '01 report. You've handled the various controversies and points of dispute delicately and adeptly, while still driving home in the end the key point (that the evidence appears to point to anomalous late 20th century behavior). I made a dozen or so minor comments--please make use of them as you see fit. Lets reconvene on this after the holidays. Thanks again for including me in and giving me an opportunity to comment. I hope the rest of your holidays go well, mike At 01:31 PM 12\/22\/2004, you wrote: Mike don't know what the status of the whole chapter is - but I thought I would send this very first and rough draft to you anyway - I have to wait and see the whole thing and hear from Peck before doing more.

I am sending what I have now even though I am not at all happy with it. It is obviously only part way there. Getting the data to produce Figures and work out how to design them is going to be time very consuming and I will rely entirely on Tim here to do them - and the regional input stuff if wanted will need input from a number of people that I have not been able to contact (see later) The borehole discussion (contributed to by Henry Pollack) will need batting around and Henry (and Mike , who contributed a section on regional forced changes) will need to be kept on board. There will be loads to say on the simulated temperature histories and Tim will help here also - but much is unpublished or even unanalysed (hence Simon and Eduardo will need to contribute eventually). The glacier bit at the end is what Olga sent and I have not had time to work through it. You two need to give some direction as to how much you wish to have explicitly looking at the mass of NAO?AO reconstructions , ditto ENSO or PDO and all the simulations of these - but at this stage not sure where in overall plan all this going. Do we really want a discussion on MWP and LIA per se ? The regional descriptions , including Southern Hemisphere could be infinite length and I suppose we should only discuss longest or pre assimilated information - but will need specific input here from colleagues if we are to do these regional (including precipitation ) sections .

{"text":"Speaker Ryan and his House Republican Conference say they're shocked at presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's appalling policies and despicable rhetoric. Yet for years, Republicans in Congress have advanced the same kind of extremist, reprehensible language and discriminatory legislation. Americans aren't buying the GOP's surprised attitude. As Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats leaders said yesterday: there's \"not a dime's worth of difference \" between Trump and House Republicans. POLITICO : House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday blasted House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans in the chamber who have been unwilling to support Donald Trump. \"Some Republicans, including members of their leadership, have said they cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the Republican front-runner,\" Pelosi said at the outset of a news conference convened by House Democrats. \"Today, we have gathered to ask, since when? Since when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas?\" Pelosi said Republicans appear to be surprised by the rhetoric Trump and former GOP candidates deployed on the campaign trail. \"But year after year, Republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation,\" she said. The California Democrat argued that there isn't \"a dime's worth of difference\" between Trump and Republicans in the lower chamber, remarking that House Republicans attacked women's health care a dozen times and threatened a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding. \"The Republicans have created an environment in radicalism, fear and exclusion,\" Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said. \"The presumptive nominee is the result of their work, and what they have sowed is what they are reaping.\" The Hill : \"What has happened in this campaign is that Donald Trump has pulled back the veil,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday during a press briefing in the Capitol. \"What he says, is what they say, and now people can see the connection between them.\" Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the minority whip, piled on, accusing the Republicans of \"creating an environment of radicalism, fear and exclusion\" that echoes in Trump's message. \"The presumptive nominee is the result of their work,\" Hoyer charged. \"And what they have sowed they are now reaping.\" GOP criticism of Trump hit a highpoint last week when Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), the highest-ranking Republican in Washington, took the extraordinary step of refusing to endorse Trump's bid, citing concerns with the tenor of Trump's message as well as policy positions that run counter to Ryan's conservative leanings. \"Since when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas?\" Pelosi asked. \"They appear to be shocked by their candidate \u2026 by their rhetoric on the campaign trail. But year after year, Republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation,\" she added. \"Whether it's insulting President Obama, women, immigrants, Muslims, LGBT Americans \u2013\u2013 there's not a dime's worth of difference between what Donald Trump says and what the House Republicans have been saying all along.\" The Democrats unveiled a video highlighting statements by rank-and-file members. In one clip, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) claims that an overwhelming majority of undocumented immigrants are drug smugglers \"with calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\" In another, Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, says he \"absolutely\" promotes the universal surveillance of mosques and Muslim communities. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) promotes his bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks by claiming that the \"incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.\" And Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas), in still another clip, decries the \"fascist intolerance\" of gay rights advocates, comparing them to Nazis. Rep. Joe Crowley (N.Y.), vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, said such statements have given rise to Trump, and any Republicans lamenting their presidential frontrunner have only themselves to blame. Rep. Jim Clyburn (S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat and a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus, took the argument back much further, maintaining that Trump's bellicose message has roots in other Republican campaigns of decades past. He cited Barry Goldwater's opposition to the Civil Rights Act; Richard Nixon's \"Southern Strategy;\" and Ronald Reagan's campaign speech outside Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights activists had been murdered by white supremacists in 1964. Huffington Post : \u2026House Democratic leaders argued that Republicans over the years created the very environment in which the former reality TV star has risen politically. Throughout his campaign, Trump has tried to isolate disadvantaged groups, starting with Mexican immigrants, whom he described as \"criminals\" and \"rapists.\" As president, he said, he would ban Muslims from entering the U.S. He referred to Fox News host Megyn Kelly's menstrual cycle when accusing her of asking unfair questions. \"The list goes on,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). A brief video, played at the Democrats' press conference, showed Republicans making similar comments years before Trump entered the political scene. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) was heard in one clip standing by his 2007 remarks to Politico that there \"are too many mosques in this country.\" In another clip, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) compared LGBT rights advocates to Nazis. And in a 2013 clip, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) claimed that undocumented immigrants have \"calves the size of cantaloupes\" because they are carrying drugs across the border. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) took the story back even further to the 1960s, when he said Republican candidate Barry Goldwater kicked off his presidential campaign with opposition to the Civil Rights Act. Next, GOP candidate Richard Nixon built his run for the White House on what Nixon dubbed the \"Southern strategy,\" said Clyburn. Morning Consult : \u2026House Democratic leaders played a video designed to flesh out their central argument about why voters should choose their party in November. They say that Donald Trump's controversial rhetoric\u2026been used by House Republicans for years. \"House Republicans in their own words,\" a title card reads at the start, as a piano recording of \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" begins in the background. The video then launches into a montage of House Republicans on camera saying that mosques should be kept under government surveillance or that President Obama may not have been born in the United States and arguing that federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be curtailed. \"There's not a dime's worth of difference between what Donald Trump says and what House Republicans have been saying all along,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters on Wednesday. \"Our point is, since when \u2014 all of a sudden \u2014 is this very same rhetoric appalling to the Republican leadership and some of the Republican establishment?\" \"Donald Trump is the offspring of Republicans in Congress,\" echoed Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), chairmen of the House Democratic Caucus. MRCTV : During a press conference Wednesday addressing how presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's \"rhetoric\" is allegedly similar to comments made by House Republicans, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said late-night comedy shows have done a \"good job\" attacking Trump and that the \"traditional press\" should \"do that as well.\" While trying to provide examples of how Trump's words allegedly mirror what House Republicans have been saying, Pelosi said there was a prepared video she was unable to show because of House rules. She said, \"But if you saw a side-by-side, you'd see his birther remarks and their birther remarks. His anti-Muslim remarks and their building walls to Muslims, to immigrants, to the rest. The list goes on. You know it. You could put this piece together yourselves. But to help you along and encourage that, we wanted to present some of the facts to you.\" Washington Examiner : House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi released a new video on Wednesday that blasts Republican lawmakers for embracing the policies and positions of their party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump. The video does not mention Trump by name, but instead uses a series of soundbites taken from interviews and floor speeches given by congressional Republicans to further substantiate the Democrats' claims that Trump and House Republicans are anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-women, and anti-LGBT. Statements made by Republican Reps. Peter King of New York, Steve King of Iowa, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Louie Gohmert of Texas, among others, about immigrants, monitoring mosques and ending the federal funding of Planned Parenthood are featured in the video. \"House Republicans: The Party of Radicalism and Fear,\" the screen reads after nearly two minutes of soundbites. Pelosi released the video during a press conference Wednesday morning as part of the Democrats' effort to win back a majority in both chambers now that Republicans face a rift in their own party with Trump as their nominee. She argued that Republicans can't pretend to be shocked by Trump's controversial comments when they agree with so much of what Trump says. \"[D]on't you wonder why, and since when, all of the sudden, [the] Republican establishment is appalled by the comments of what Donald Trump is saying when it's what we hear here every day?\" she asked. Daily Mail : Pelosi and four other top Democrats took turns quoting House Republicans and comparing their comments to those of Trump, who will make an appearance tomorrow in Washington and meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan who has sporadically condemned The Donald's remarks. 'Today we gather to ask, \"Since when?\"' said Pelosi, taking the podium. 'Since when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas?' Pelosi, along with Reps. Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, Xavier Becerra and James Crowley, all members of the House Democratic leadership, took turns giving examples of comments the Republicans have made, including Rep. Joe Wilson's famous 'you lie' during the State of the Union and Rep. Steve King's 'calves the size of cantaloupes' aimed at immigrants coming from Mexico and south. 'On the evening of [Obama's] inauguration, [Republicans] met at a local restaurant to plot their program of undercutting and undermining his authority as president of the United States and, as if on cue, Donald Trump picked up his efforts to lead the birther movement,' Clyburn pointed out. 'But he didn't stop with just the birth certificate. He began to raise issue with the president's college transcripts as if not only to delegitimize him as president, but to devalue him as a human being,' Clyburn continued. The Democrats also played a video of some of what they considered to be the most heinous quotes. 'Since when has the Republican leadership in this House been appalled by anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT, anti-Barack Obama, anti-woman comments made by their members?' she mused. PJ Media : House Democratic leaders began their press conference today by showing a video of Republican lawmakers saying things that, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued, proves they're no different than Donald Trump. The video includes quotes from Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) on surveillance of Muslims, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on Mexican drug smugglers, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) on defunding Planned Parenthood, and more. \"All we could present to you today is what they had said in an official setting. In another setting off campus, we will show you what they have said on the campaign trail... I said there's not a dime's worth of difference between Donald Trump and the House Republicans what they say. Attacks on women in the Congress are a dime a dozen. Republicans use taxpayer funds to create a panel to attack women's health and advance a plan of blatant intimidation,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"They are taking names. They are taking names. You saw that chairwoman of that committee, Congresswoman Blackburn, they are taking names. Does that sound familiar? Republican Trent Franks tries to roll back women's access to comprehensive healthcare because he thinks rape can't cause pregnancy, and he's a Judiciary Subcommittee chair. Meanwhile, again, Marsha Blackburn says women don't want equal pay and Speaker Ryan calls leave for families an unfunded mandated while he says people should have time to spend with their families but -- personally, but not to support it officially.\" Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) added that \"the Republicans have created an environment of radicalism, fear and exclusion.\" \"The presumptive nominee is the result of their work, and what they have sowed they are now reaping,\" Hoyer said. \"Tomorrow, House Republicans will welcome Donald Trump to Capitol Hill, someone who supports legislation to allow businesses to refuse services to LGBT people and their families; segregation revisited. But this is nothing new, as the leader has said. In fact, House Republicans have been supporting policy that expressly discriminate against Americans based on who they are or who they love.\" Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) charged that \"from day one, Republican leaders and operatives have orchestrated a program of unprecedented disrespect for President Barack Obama... and as if on cue, Donald Trump picked up his efforts to lead the birther movement.\" Washington Examiner : Pelosi and other Democrats gathered to make the case that as shocking as some of Trump's comments can be, he is mirroring many of the same things House Republicans have said over the last few years. Democrats put together a video showing Republicans making what they say are anti-woman and anti-immigrant comments. Pelosi said a side-by-side of Trump and GOP members could have easily been made by the press, but said Democrats were happy to help do it for reporters. She said some late-night TV shows have made these comparisons, and said she hopes the \"traditional press\" will start doing the same.","label":0}

{"text":"And one more from Variety (this article was the main feature in their latest edition) Amy Dacey, CEO of the Democratic National Committee, says, \"You have to go to where people are getting their information, and where people are watching. Some times I think candidates go to places where they think they can get their message across in a fast way, but they also diversify. They are talking to print reporters. They are talking on cable news. They are talking on social media. And they are having some appearances on some of these shows. But the bottom line is to get more people engaged and realizing about the election and what is at stake, so I think you have to factor in all of those things.\" Presidential Race Takes Over Pop Culture as Hopefuls Embrace Celebrity Status [Senior Editor] Ted Johnson Senior Editor Bernie Sanders looked exhausted as he got off a flight from Las Vegas in October at Burbank Bob Hope Airport and walked through the concourse, to be met by a reporter with a question. The query concerned the record ratings for the first Democratic debate, and Sanders gave a serious, on-message answer that tied the Nielsens to his campaign's core message, saying the numbers proved that viewers are interested in \"the real crises facing the American middle class.\" An hour later, Sanders was decidedly more lighthearted, dancing on a Warner Bros. soundstage during an appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" where he answered questions about his hair, whether he'd ever been in handcuffs and his favorite member of One Direction. [ ANITA KUNZ FOR VARIETY It's nothing new for candidates to gamely turn to showbiz outlets to reach the electorate. But in this crazy election cycle, what is new is the magnitude of such activity. Never has politics been so blended with entertainment. Contentious presidential debates help drive larger audiences than most new fall series; candidates are eager to take part in sketches on late-night TV and strive to be hip to pop-culture references, to sprinkle catch-phrases into their tweets and to reveal their music playlists; and celebrity surrogates are as polarizing as the candidates themselves. It's a climate in which celebrity status seems to translate into political clout, and in which level of exposure is scrutinized as much as polling numbers. A carnival atmosphere has always surrounded presidential campaigns, but the mix of pop with politics has become serious business that translates to awareness, attention and adulation. MediaQuant, an analytics firm, drew headlines last month when it calculated Donald Trump 's \"earned media\" output \u2014 a dollar amount tied to the free exposure he has gotten from countless interviews, magazine covers, talk-show skits and morning-show call-in interviews. The tally was $2.4 billion \u2014 more than the combined total for Hillary Clinton ($947 million), Ted Cruz ($532 million) and Sanders ($480 million). By another measurement \u2014 exposure across hundreds of consumer publications \u2014 Trump and Clinton beat sports stars like Tom Brady and celebrities like Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber when it comes to the value of their \"earned\" media, according to MediaQuant. \"One of the things I have gotten marginally famous for years ago was saying, 'Politics is show business for ugly people,' \" says political consultant Paul Begala, chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore ticket. \"And so much more today than ever,\" he adds. \"It is becoming both more showbiz-y and more ugly.\" Take Hillary Clinton, whose cameo on \"Saturday Night Live\" drew enough of a stir that the candidate has embraced other scripted shows, including making a highly publicized appearance on Comedy Central sitcom \"Broad City.\" Her campaign has countered the news-media drumbeat of \"those damn emails\" and Goldman Sachs speeches with exposure that is humorous and self-deprecating. In March, the Clinton campaign unveiled an unusual 30-second spot on ABC that featured the stars of Shonda Rhimes' shows \u2014 and that ran the night those series aired. The network was apparently concerned enough over potential viewer confusion that it released a statement noting that \"broadcasters are required by the FCC to carry these ads.\" Cruz, whose image was heavily defined by D.C. media as the man who once helped shut down the government, made a habit of sprinkling into his speeches references to \"Star Wars,\" along with TV-born catchphrases like \"jump the shark\" and a reenactment of the \"mostly dead\" scene from \"The Princess Bride.\" Just a few months into his campaign, he appeared in a Buzzfeed video in which he did an array of impressions from \"The Simpsons.\" [ Bernie Sanders visits with \"Ellen\"; Hillary Clinton cozies up to\"Broad City's\" Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson; Ted Cruz channels \"Simpsons\" characters for Buzzfeed. COURTESY OF COMEDY CENTRAL\/NBC\/BUZZFEED When Sanders first entered the race, he seemed so laser-focused on his core message that he couldn't be bothered with offbeat questions on lifestyle topics. Last August, he scolded a New York Times writer who asked him about the scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's hair vs. his. But by the time he did Ellen's show, he was game to laugh. Then there's Donald Trump, who entered the campaign (down an escalator) already an entertainment celebrity via \"The Apprentice,\" but one with a rather high negative 'Q' score. He countered with shtick \u2014 a break-all-the-rules strategy in which all publicity is good publicity. In the first Republican debate, when Megyn Kelly asked him about his treatment of women, his first instinct wasn't to attack the question or Kelly (although he eventually did) but to get in a nasty one-liner about Rosie O'Donnell. Mark McKinnon, political consultant and co-creator of Showtime's \"The Circus,\" which documents the ongoing campaign, says Americans are looking to be entertained as well as informed. \"So to break through the clutter,\" he says, \"the candidates are compelled to look to nontraditional venues and formats to communicate their message. \"One thing we've learned doing 'The Circus' is that voters are hungry for authenticity,\" he adds. \"They want to see what the candidates are like beyond the talking points, debates and speeches. So, alternative approaches give them an opportunity to show a side of themselves that voters rarely see but want to see. It gives voters more context and nuance for what kind of person the candidate is.\" Kristina Schake, deputy communications director for the Clinton campaign, says appearances on entertainment shows are great avenues to reach people, and have allowed the candidate to share information younger voters may not know about, such as her time at Wellesley College or with the Children's Defense Fund, before she was Secretary of State. Bits on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other shows, she says, \"have been invaluable.\" \"The skit of Hillary playing Val the bartender [on \"SNL\"] and Kate McKinnon playing Hillary was one of the most talked about television appearances in terms of reach this cycle,\" Schake says. \"These moments matter because they transcend party affiliation, and everyone can enjoy them. The Secretary has enjoyed them too, and still can't believe they convinced her to sing in it.\" \"One of the things I have gotten marginally famous for years ago was saying, 'Politics is show business for ugly people.' And so much more today than ever. It is becoming both more showbiz-y and more ugly.\" PAUL BEGALA, POLITICAL STRATEGIST The rise in such appearances also is a function of a fragmented media universe. Amy Dacey, CEO of the Democratic National Committee, says, \"You have to go to where people are getting their information, and where people are watching. Some times I think candidates go to places where they think they can get their message across in a fast way, but they also diversify. They are talking to print reporters. They are talking on cable news. They are talking on social media. And they are having some appearances on some of these shows. But the bottom line is to get more people engaged and realizing about the election and what is at stake, so I think you have to factor in all of those things.\" Television has long been seen as an outlet to connect with voters \u2014 but some candidates have expressed reluctance. Almost 50 years ago, as Richard Nixon's handlers carefully crafted a comeback, they convinced him to do a guest spot on \"The Mike Douglas Show,\" the soft, celebrity-driven talk show based in Philadelphia. \"You know, politics is more and more becoming show business,\" Nixon said, as he bantered over such topics as his tan with Douglas and that week's co-hosts, Sandler and Young. Off camera, Nixon reportedly said, \"It's a shame a man has to use gimmicks like this to get elected.\" Nine months later, having secured the Republican nomination amid the tumult of 1968, Nixon tapped pop culture again. He did the hottest show on TV, \"Laugh-In,\" in a clip that lasted just a few seconds but showed he was hip to what was hip. \"Sock it to me?\" he said, repeating the show's catchphrase. \"Laugh-In\" creator George Schlatter notes that the show tried, but failed, to get rival Hubert Humphrey to appear. In the years since, candidates have tapped pop culture to varying degrees: President Gerald Ford made a pre-filmed cameo on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the midst of the 1976 primary campaign; Ronald Reagan, the first actor to become president, used a signature line from one of his movies \u2014 \"Go win one for the Gipper\" \u2014 as a call to action for his campaign; and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" during the 1992 race. \"When we put Bill Clinton on 'Arsenio Hall,' it was scandalous,\" Begala recalls. \"We got a ton of static. And now it is mandatory.\" Perhaps no candidate or president has been more savvy in trying to command attention through entertainment than President Obama. He was the first sitting commander-in-chief to make an in-studio appearance on a late-night talk show, when he sat down with Jay Leno on \"The Tonight Show\" less than two months after taking office. In 2013, his appearance with Zach Galifianakis on Funny or Die's \"Between Two Ferns\" was credited with helping drive enrollment in Obama Care. By the time he appeared in Jerry Seinfield's \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" last year, any talk of whether Obama's cameos are \"presidential\" had given way to discussion of whether they are laugh-out-loud funny. By the time of this year's campaign, it wasn't a question of whether a candidate would do late-night TV; it was how far they would go to make a mark. [ Donald Trump has been so ubiquitous in the media this campaign season, sometimes it seems like there must be more than one of him. Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond help fuel that conceit on a skit from the Trump-hosted Nov. 7 airing of \"Saturday Night Live.\" COURTESY OF NBC While late-night interviews with candidates have made news, comedic skits have made lasting impressions, like the one in which Clinton took a phone call from Trump (aka Fallon) on \"The Tonight Show,\" or when Mitt Romney read mean tweets from Trump on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" or, most prominently, when Trump himself hosted \"Saturday Night Live.\" Jon Macks, a writer on Leno's \"Tonight Show\" throughout its run who specializes in political humor, says that with candidates popping up all over late night, mere appearances no longer pack the punch they once did. \"It is what it is,\" he says. \"You are not going to see JFK, when he was a senator, on Jack Paar for an hour. Or John Kerry on Jay Leno having a legitimate and smart conversation about policies. You see it once in a while, but not to the degree you have seen it in the past.\" Part of the reason is the drive for skits that will travel virally \u2014 not necessarily a desire to succinctly convey a policy position. \"In a world defined by six-second Vines, the eight-second sound bite seems like the Gettysburg Address,\" Macks says. \"The candidates are entertainment in and of themselves,\" he adds. \"When candidates go on 'Jimmy Fallon,' they are not going on to position themselves with the electorate. They are going on to be part of a skit. They are not doing a bit to lead to some big policy discussion. It is entertainment as pure entertainment.\" For the few candidates who balk, the alternative is to be out-entertained. Dave Berg, co-producer of Leno's \"Tonight Show,\" was a supporter of Marco Rubio and urged the campaign to maximize opportunities on late night. Instead, he said, the campaign squandered its chances: Rubio's appearance on \"The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\" in January, for instance, turned out to be unmemorable. Berg calls the interview \"substandard,\" and wonders why the Rubio campaign didn't try to tap further into pop culture, given the candidate's telegenic personality and youth. When candidates do try comedy, the right choices are \"very, very important,\" Berg says, even though such appearances are typically short on policy details. \"It is important that you get the right sketch. If it is the wrong sketch, it can be disastrous.\" When Kerry appeared on \"Leno\" during the 2004 campaign, he insisted on riding in on a motorcycle. The result, says Berg, \"reminded me of Dukakis riding in the tank with a helmet on.\" Candidates almost always have veto power over a sketch. \"Some of our writers would write 10 bits that would be rejected by the candidates,\" Berg recalls. \"Our writers couldn't stand Al Gore. His people would reject bit after bit, even though they were going to vote for him.\" Still, rarely were candidates unwilling to do any routine at all, he says. \"One thing I have learned about people in the political world, and also about commentators and journalists: In each and every one of these people is a comedian dying to get out.\" Actor Mark Ruffalo, an activist-actor who is backing Sanders, believes authenticity is the key to successfully connecting with voters via entertainment platforms. He notes that his son's favorite shows are on YouTube, featuring user-generated celebrities, because \"it has a credibility to it. There is no artifice. \"When candidates go on 'Jimmy Fallon,' they are not going on to position themselves with the electorate. They are going on to be part of a skit. It is entertainment as pure entertainment.\" JON MACKS, WRITER \"It is reaching people in ways that the mainstream media can't, for one,\" he adds. \"It is a direct line to your constituency. There is no middle man.\" Such a targeted connection is important, he says, because of the way people consume media. \"We live in this era of decentralization,\" he explains. \"The entertainment industry is decentralizing. The news is decentralizing. What you are seeing is politicians finally realizing it is a way of reaching people that feels less artificial.\" Earlier this month, Clinton ended Trump's dominance of one audience metric when she surpassed him in weekly YouTube views, according to video identification tech firm Zefr. A reason: The clip of her struggle to use a New York subway card was a big draw, with more than 1 million views. Begala points out that as much as we've seen the fusion of campaigns and entertainment, what we have yet to witness this cycle is a breakthrough viral hit on the order of Will.i.am's 2008 \"Yes, We Can\" video, which featured Obama's New Hampshire primary speech and went on to post more than 20 million hits on YouTube. \"That was groundbreaking,\" Begala says. \"I think you will get that, but it has to be organic. It can't be forced by some political consultant like me.\" There has been unique user-generated content. Cruz's obsession with \"Star Wars\" inspired a video \u2014 \"The Constitution Strikes Back,\" with Cruz as a Jedi warrior \u2014 created by producer Joel Gilbert. Gilbert made the video independently of the campaign \u2014 although Cruz's team did tweet it out after it was posted. Gilbert says he saw a need for something that could do more to market Cruz's image and background, particularly to younger voters, given that the candidate is 45 and now the youngest in the race. \"Generally these Republican strategists, who have been running campaigns for years, don't have much of an affinity of how powerful pop culture can be,\" Gilbert says. As much as showbiz is intrinsic to politics, the downside is when theatrics overshadow serious thinking. One of the more telling quotes from the current candidates came from Trump, who discussed his media ubiquity with Time in March. \"I go on one of these shows, and the ratings double,\" he said. \"They triple. And that gives you power. It's not the polls. It's the ratings.\" RELATED [1952: On Sept. 23, vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon responds to accusations of financial improprieties on national TV, vowing to keep his dog Checkers no matter what, and garnering the largest television audience at that time.] Politics and Pop Culture: Top Moments in History Star Jones, former co-host of \"The View,\" who has been a surrogate for Clinton, says that the vitriol of this campaign is a contrast to previous cycles. \"It is almost as if we have gone to the reality-show world of politics.\" That is especially true when it comes to celebrities entering the political area \u2014 and 2016 is destined to define the limits of that success. Fred Grandy, who ran for Congress and won in 1986, two years after starring in \"The Love Boat,\" says that Trump is running up against the public's desire for the next act. The billionaire spent the time after his wins on Super Tuesday and his loss in Wisconsin going from one reality-show-like flap to another. \"He has not been able to take the enormous advantage that celebrity confers upon you, and deepen that into a kind of gravitas and wisdom that gives people a certain comfort level,\" Grandy says. Trump's recent win in New York helped him rebound, but he still faces high unfavorable polling numbers. The candidate, Grandy adds, has seized on two key issues, immigration and trade, and has capitalized on his ability to stage a show. \"Donald Trump has a speaking cadence that is somewhat between standup and rap, but people like that. It is talking to somebody and not down to somebody.\" Still, at a certain point voters will want assurance that candidates will be presidential. \"Trump has had popularity,\" Grandy says. \"It doesn't mean it is a love affair. It's an infatuation.\" From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Friday, April 15, 2016 2:33 PM To: Wei, Shu-Yen Cc: Manriquez, Pablo; Comm_D Subject: RE: Dacey Courts AAPI Voters in Los Angeles A little late, but here's one more article: DNC REACHING OUT TO ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA By Steve Angeles, Balitang America The 2016 presidential election is seven months away.

She also said 4.5 million Asian Americans are now 18 and were able to register to vote in 2012. \"I do think they can have a strong voice in this election, and I do think what you're seeing are issues that they do care about,\" said Dacey. \"That's why we're doing a lot of outreach right now, myself, we are doing this swing through.\" Dacey said the DNC is continuing to reach out to Asian Americans and the Asian Pacific Islander community through various groups and community organizations. They also correspond with weekly papers, radio stations and social media to spread information. When it comes to the election cycles, primaries and nominations are often wrapped up before California's June primaries but this time, with Bernie Sanders gaining some momentum against Hillary Clinton, there is a possibility that the Golden State can play a role in the Democratic race. \"Both candidates were recently here,\" she said. \"Whether it was a big rally, talked to individuals and had a very serious speech that secretary Clinton gave about the importance of what's happening in our foreign policy, I think that clearly shows they're invested in California.\" Leaders from both parties have come out to Los Angeles to do their own outreach. Jason Chung, national director of the Asian Pacific American Initiatives for the Republican National Committee also came to California for outreach efforts. He joined Dacey at the Asian American justice conference, where they were part of a panel that unveiled new polling data on California's Asian American voters. Data showed that no matter the party\u2013Democrat, Republican, or Independent\u2013the state's Asian American voters have similar priorities. Immigration, education and health care are issues that are expected to bring them to the ballot boxes.

DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy Dacey told reporters yesterday (Wednesday in Manila) they have expanded their grassroots outreach to members of the nation's fastest-growing ethnic group. \"We're looking at how we're communicating with them\u2026and how they're getting their information about the party, what we stand for, the general election and our candidates,\" Dacey said in a roundtable discussion with the media in downtown Los Angeles. \"We're working on the local level everyday to do that. Peer-to-peer conversation, people hearing from members of their community matters a lot.\" Studies show AAPIs will soon outnumber Latinos as the largest immigrant group coming to the United States. While AAPIs are concentrated in California and New York, they are also rapidly growing in the battleground states of Nevada, Virginia, and Florida. That means capturing the Asian American vote is important in the November elections, according to the Asian American Advancing Justice, which is set to release new polling data on AAPIs today (Thursday in Manila). In the last few presidential elections, Fil-Ams and other AAPIs had leaned heavily democrat, and the DNC hopes to get more of them to vote. \"The issues that (Democrats) are focusing on are very tuned in to the Filipino-American community, especially the issues ofimmigration and health care,\" said Fil-Am Fritz Friedman, former Sony Pictures senior vice president of worldwide publicity who serves on the credentials committee for DNC's national convention this July in Philadelphia. \"Also, the Democratic Party is much more inclusive. They understand people of color, as opposed to Republicans (who), in my opinion, are not as sensitive to the interests of the ethnic minorities in this country.\" Dacey said she's confident the party will have a presidential nominee before the national convention and that nominee will win the race for the White House. \"I am confident that one of our candidates will be the 45th president of the United States,\" said Dacey, who is scheduled to meet with party leaders in California. She declined to say who she thought would be the presidential nominee. \"Both (Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) have run campaigns that are worthy of the office of the president,\" she said.

{"text":"Hi Phil I am sure you know that this is not about the science. It is an attack to undermine the science in some way. In that regard I don't think you can ignore it all, as Mike suggests as one option, but the response should try to somehow label these guys and lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such a database. Indeed technology and data handling capabilities have evolved and not everything was saved. So my feeble suggestion is to indeed cast aspersions on their motives and throw in some counter rhetoric. Labeling them as lazy with nothng better to do seems like a good thing to do. How about \"I tried to get some data from McIntyre from his 1990 paper, but I was unable because he doesn't have such a paper because he has not done any constructive work!\" There is no basis for retracting a paper given in Keenan's message. One may have to offer a correction that a particular sentence was not correct if it claimed something that indeed was not so. But some old instrumental data are like paleo data, and can only be used with caution as the metadata do not exist. It doesn't mean they are worthless and can not be used. Offering to make a correction to a few words in a paper in a trivial manner will undermine his case. Kevin > Hi Phil, > > This is all too predictable.

{"text":"Kevin, that's an interesting point. As the plot from Gavin I sent shows, we can easily account for the observed surface cooling in terms of the natural variability seen in the CMIP3 ensemble (i.e. the observed cold dip falls well within it). So in that sense, we can \"explain\" it. But this raises the interesting question, is there something going on here w\/ the energy & radiation budget which is inconsistent with the modes of internal variability that leads to similar temporary cooling periods within the models. I'm not sure that this has been addressed--has it? m On Oct 14, 2009, at 10:17 AM, Kevin Trenberth wrote: Hi Tom How come you do not agree with a statement that says we are no where close to knowing where energy is going or whether clouds are changing to make the planet brighter. We are not close to balancing the energy budget.

It is a travesty! Kevin Tom Wigley wrote: Dear all, At the risk of overload, here are some notes of mine on the recent lack of warming. I look at this in two ways. The first is to look at the difference between the observed and expected anthropogenic trend relative to the pdf for unforced variability. The second is to remove ENSO, volcanoes and TSI variations from the observed data. Both methods show that what we are seeing is not unusual. The second method leaves a significant warming over the past decade. These sums complement Kevin's energy work.

The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate. That said there is a LOT of nonsense about the PDO. People like CPC are tracking PDO on a monthly basis but it is highly correlated with ENSO. Most of what they are seeing is the change in ENSO not real PDO. It surely isn't decadal. The PDO is already reversing with the switch to El Nino.

{"text":"By Ben White | 05\/10\/2016 08:00 AM EDT DONALD TRUMP'S DEBT PROBLEM - POLITICO's Ben White: \"Donald Trump has a debt problem. Twice in the last five days the presumptive Republican nominee has said things about dealing with the $19 trillion federal debt that left Wall Street terrified, Republicans dumbfounded and Democrats licking their chops. The trouble for Trump began Thursday on CNBC when he appeared to suggest that as president he would not repay all the U.S. debt owed to creditors. Asked if the U.S. should repay its debts in full or ask creditors to take less, Trump said: 'I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.' ... Financial experts instantly leaped on the comments, suggesting that Trump - who is no stranger to bankruptcy as an executive - would allow the U.S. to default for the first time in its history, an event which could send interest rates soaring and tank the U.S. economy. FAILED CLEAN-UP ATTEMPT - Trump went on CNN on Monday morning to clear things up. Of course he would never allow the U.S. to default. Anyone who suggested such a thing must be 'crazy.' What Trump meant to say was that if interests rates rise he would consider buying back existing U.S. debt at a lower prices. As interest rates rise, the price of existing debt goes down. ... But then he landed himself right back in the soup. \"'This is the United States government,' Trump said. 'First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you.' That comment - that the U.S. can simply pay back its trillions of dollars in debt by printing a ton more money - drove Wall Street crazy again \"'If there is ever an example of how dumb it is to print money to handle debt I'm in a country which has had had to learn that the hard way more than once,' said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, speaking from a conference in Argentina. \"'It's a stupid idea. You don't discharge debt especially U.S. dollar debt by printing money. You do print money to create liquidity for banking systems in trouble but you don't print money to cheapen your debt which is the reserve currency of the world.\"  QUOTE OF THE DAY - AAF's Douglas Holtz-Eakin on Trump's latest comments on debt: \"This is yet another big misstep. What he is implying is the era of Fed independence is over. I no longer know what Trump does and doesn't know about managing the debt but I'm pretty sure I don't trust his judgment. \"I also worry about the international community watching this daily. They have reason to be nervous about him. If I were advising him I'd say let's take a day or two off of this and talk about beauty pageants or something else you know about because this has got to stop.\" LEW ON TRUMP - Via POLITICO's Colin Wilhelm: \"I'm not going to comment on what anyone's saying on the campaign trail ... We have the deepest, most liquid market in the world for U.S. Treasury [bonds] and that's based on the fact that it has been a priority to treat servicing of our debt as a responsibility that we have to take very, very seriously.\" HOW TRUMP AND CLINTON INVEST - Bloomberg's Charles Stein: \"The Vanguard 500 Index Fund is Hillary and Bill Clinton's top holding - they've invested between $5 million and $25 million in it ... The $185 billion fund, which charges a 0.05 percent fee, is the only investment listed aside from cash and insurance policies. Trump's biggest bet has been on the Obsidian hedge fund run by BlackRock Inc., with $25 million to $50 million invested, according to his July 2015 filing. \"The hedge fund, which had about $1.9 billion in assets as of March, charges a 1 percent management fee and 20 percent of profits. Trump also reported placing $1 million to $5 million in each of three hedge funds run by John Paulson's Paulson & Co., and investments of $100,000 to $5 million in 11 mutual funds managed by Baron Capital Management\"  ICI ON DOL RULE - Per remarks to be delivered today by ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens' at a conference on the DOL fiduciary rule that will include DOL's Timothy Hauser, a lead architect of the fiduciary rule: \"With its final rule, the Department has launched, in effect, a grand experiment to see whether investment providers can continue to meet retirement savers' needs under the strictures of a novel contractual regime never anticipated by ERISA - and under the constant threat of strike-suit lawyers and class-action litigation. \"None of us - in candor, not even the DOL - knows exactly how this experiment is going to play out. Our job - starting here, starting today - is to see what's needed to make this new system as beneficial as possible for the investors we serve.\" THE RECESSION STILL BITES - WSJ's Ben Leubsdorf: \"The recession ended seven years ago, but persistent joblessness and underemployment marred the economic expansion that followed. A growing body of research suggests the economic trauma has left financial and psychic scars on many Americans, and that those marks are likely to endure for decades. \"About one in six U.S. workers became unemployed during the recession years of 2007, 2008 and 2009. Today, nearly 14 million people are still searching for a job or stuck in part-time jobs because they can't find full-time work. Even for the millions of Americans back at work, the effects of losing a job will linger, the research suggests. They will earn less for years to come. They will be less likely to own a home. Many will struggle with psychological problems\"  GOOD TUESDAY MORNING - Hope the Caps can hang on and bring it back to DC for Game 7 against the Penguins. If not, MM owes somebody some Mumbo Sauce.

THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES - Colin Wilhelm on Jack Lew's visit to Puerto Rico -- and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m.-- please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com NEW PUERTO RICO BILL COMING WEDNESDAY - POLITICO's Patrick Temple-West: \"A new version of a bill to help Puerto Rico will be introduced in the House on Wednesday ... Will this one be able to satisfy all sides? Republicans don't want a bailout, while Democrats have labor law concerns, among others. ... For weeks, the House Natural Resources Committee's Republican staff has been working on legislation, which has faced opposition from Puerto Rico bondholders who have railed against the bill on the airwaves in congressional districts. ... \"Last week, Puerto Rico failed to pay most of a $422 million debt payment that had come due. Congress has just a handful of weeks to hammer out a legislative fix to save the island from financial ruin ahead of a second default on a $2 billion debt payment due in early July.\"  TRUMP TRIES TO CLARIFY ON TAXES ETC - WSJ's Richard Rubin: \"Trump sought Monday to clarify his views on fiscal and monetary policy, saying he was open to compromise on tax cuts but wouldn't try to alter the terms of the nation's $19 trillion in debt, which he called 'absolutely sacred.' ... On tax policy, Mr. Trump said that as president he would seek to persuade congressional Democrats to lower taxes on high-income households by trading on completely unrelated and unspecified policy issues. \"'There will be a give and take. They're going to want other things having nothing to do with this,' Mr. Trump said. 'It's one very big, very complex proposal, into a negotiation.' He said he was also open to changing his tax plan unveiled last year, which proposed lowering tax rates, pushing 33 million households off the income-tax rolls and, according to an analysis, reducing federal revenue by nearly $10 trillion over the next decade. It's 'always possible to change,' Mr. Trump said. 'I always believe in flexibility and remaining flexible.'\"  MEET TRUMP'S GOLDMAN GUY - NYT's Andrew Ross Sorkin: \"Wall Street has been agog since last Thursday, when Donald Trump announced that Steven Mnuchin - who made his fortune at Goldman Sachs, worked for a firm funded by George Soros, and donated to Hillary Clinton - would be responsible for helping him raise $1 billion for Republicans and his own campaign. For if Mr. Trump is an unconventional political candidate, his appointment of Mr. Mnuchin as his national finance chairman is the epitome of just how unconventional this election has become. \"Despite what Mr. Mnuchin said was a personal friendship of 15 years, Mr. Trump has attacked both Mr. Mnuchin's investment company - suing it in 2008 over a building deal - as well as Goldman Sachs, the Democratic Party and other institutions Mr. Mnuchin has supported. ... Mr. Mnuchin is known among Manhattan's elite as part of one of the city's most influential families. His father, Robert Mnuchin, spent 30 years at Goldman Sachs, where he supervised equity trading and served on the management committee \"Mr. Mnuchin was the chairman of OneWest and sold it to CIT Group in 2015. Along the way, OneWest was involved in a string of lawsuits over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars\"  MORE BRAZILLIAN CHAOS - FT's Joe Leahy and Samantha Pearson in S\u00e3o Paulo: \"The impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil was thrown into confusion on Monday after the acting head of the lower house of congress said he was annulling a critical vote in the process. ... The Speaker, Waldir Maranh\u00e3o, said a marathon vote on April 17, in which a landslide majority of the lower house had supported the impeachment, had contained procedural irregularities and would be cancelled and held again. He did not give a specific date. ... \"The move came as the senate was preparing to vote on the process on Wednesday in a move that could lead to the suspension of Ms Rousseff and the beginning of her formal political trial if a majority, as expected, supported the motion. The surprise decision by Mr Maranh\u00e3o has thrown new uncertainty into the impeachment process, which markets had hoped would lead to a market-friendly government led by Ms Rousseff's vice-president, Michel Temer, as early as this week\"  ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR - NEW REPRT ON ONLINE GAMBLING - CEO has a new report out this a.m. on online gambling and daily fantasy sports that \"makes the case against federal regulation and says leave it to the states. The report comes in advance of a Wednesday hearing before the House Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade subcommittee on daily fantasy sports\"  GERMANY EASES STANCE ON GREECE - FT's Alex Barker and Jim Brunsden in Brussels: \"Germany eased its objections to debt relief talks for Greece on Monday as eurozone finance ministers sought to narrow their significant differences with the International Monetary Fund over Athens' \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd86bn bailout. With Greece facing \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd3.5bn in debt payments in July that it will be unable to meet without support, eurozone ministers said they were ready for a political push to break a stalemate \"Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy's finance minister, hailed the meeting as 'an important step' towards overcoming the impasse and unblocking payments but IMF officials continued to voice scepticism, particularly over how Greece would apply \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd3bn in 'contingency\" budget cuts if it missed fiscal targets. The political space for a deal was opened on Monday by the readiness of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, to explore ways to ease Greek debt repayments. He had, until then, strongly resisted such talks as unnecessary, putting IMF participation in the programme in doubt\"  ASIA DROPS AGAIN - Reuters: \"Asian stocks slipped to two-month lows on Monday as weak oil prices weighed on sentiment while the dollar got a lift against its peers as the differences in policy directions between the world's top central banks became starker. ... \"China's April consumer inflation and producer price data painted a mixed picture of deflationary pressures in the world's second largest economy. Expectations of further monetary policy easing had already been dented by strong March China data, but economists are divided over whether that was just a blip or a more sustainable trend\"  To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to kaplanj@dnc.org by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Blvd. Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Keith Yesterdy we had the final meeting to a natonal research program climat and natural catastrophies. Local authorites and Grassel, WMO summarised the major open questions on which Switzerland could work: -Changes of Forest and treeline borders eg. subalpine, or invasion of evergreen species in the chestnut forests in the Tessin -long term chronologies (they spoke about climate) -seasonal chronologies -frequency and intensity of extrem climatic events. -amount of anthropogenic input on climate and natural catastrophies. - reconstruction of precipitations -influence of natural phenomena as volcanoes and el nino on climate Nowbody said anything about growth but few were aware of the local validity of the studies made in Switzerland. Our actual studies fit perfectly to this topics. For the future (discussion in Kopenhagen) I see the following condensation points: -continue millenial temperature sensitive chronologies.Some money should go to Taimyr and Yamal an perhaps French Alps. -start with a precipitation sensitive network in Eurasia. Pinus, Juniperus in a transect from Spain to Tibet including dry sites in Sibirea. Partner could be Inst. of Geography, Bonn (Jan Esper) and Birmensdorf. -Analysis of recovery of upper timberlines in Putorana mountains in north-central Sibirea,( similar study like Shiyatov in Polar Ural). A Vice director of the Inst. of Forest in Krasnoyarsk made a little Proposal (Dr. Abraimov). I have a PhD Student who make the same in the Swiss Alps near St. Moritz. -Growth-climate studies in a test region in central Sibirea. Very good is the baikal region. There is a very steep precepitation gradiant ,200mm - 1800mm in a distance of 40 km.and in accordance a steep vegetation gradiant from the steppe to pine forest to Abies sibirica stands.Victor Voronin made a little proposel) At least one valley in the Abies region in the south of lake Baikal is heavily polluted An almost identical study has been made in southern Germany(Spiecker) in a transect from Lorraine to the black forest mill,(SO2). -Reconstruction of extreme events in Central Europe (R. Vogels thesis shows how to do it) I am convinced that we could gather much mor material across Europe. That could be a topic for a thesis. It must not be part of an EU-proposal. Can we discuss this suggestions at Kopenhagen? Sincerely Fritz","label":0}

The tasks have been re-jigged, with the main change being a broadening of flood risk management to flood and coastal erosion risk management (FCERM). This means a wider audience to include all operating authorities, and the best practice guidance required (new Task 11) is now substantial element, to include evaluation of FCERM climate change adaptation, case studies and provision of evidence to help upgrade the FCDPAG3 Supplementary Note. We have just one week to finish this tender, as it must be posted on Friday 23rd. We are putting together the bid document, which we'll circulate on Monday 19th, but in the meantime, and by the end of Tuesday 20th, I need everyone to send information (as indicated in brackets) to support the following structure: + Understanding of the tender + Methodology and programme (methodology for tasks \/ sub-tasks - see below - and timing) + Project team, including individual and corporate experience (who you are putting forward, pen portraits, corporate case studies) + Financial and commercial (day rates and number of days; please also highlight potential issues with the T&Cs e.g. IPR) + Health & Safety, Quality and Environmental Management + Appendices (full CVs, limited to 6 pages) Please send to me and Rob McSweeney. The information I have already e.g. on day rates, core pen portraits etc will go straight into the version we're working on, so no need to re-send. In terms of tasks (new nos.), the following organisation is suggested based on what has been noted to date: Task 1 (Inception meeting and reporting) Atkins, supported by lead representatives of partners Task 2 (Project board meetings) Atkins, supported by lead representatives of partners Task 3 (Analysis of user needs) Atkins with Tyn@UEA and OUCE, plus Futerra depending on style Task 4 (Phase 2 programme) Atkins, supported by all Task 5 (Interpret messages from UKCIP08 projections) CRU, OUCE and Newcastle, with Atkins advice on sectors Task 6 (Development of business specific projections) Newcastle and CRU, with Atkins advice on policy and ops Task 7 (Putting UKCIP08 in context) CRU, Newcastle and OUCE Task 8 (User guidance) Atkins, Tyn@UEA, Futerra Task 9 (Pilot studies) Atkins, Newcastle, OUCE, Tyn@UEA Task 10 (Phase 3 programme) Atkins, supported by all Task 11 (Best Practice Guidance for FCERM) Newcastle and Atkins, with CRU Task 12 (Awareness raising events) Atkins, key experts, Futerra (perhaps as an option as EA are quite specific here) Task 13 (Training events) Atkins and Futerra Note that Futerra is a communications consultancy, specialising in sustainability, who will input on workshops and on the guidance documents.

LARCH RADIAL GROWTH IN THE EAST OF TAYMIR AND PUTORAN FOR THE LAST 2000 YEARS M.M.Naurzbaev, E.A.Vaganov Taymir Biospheric Reserve, Khatanga Institute of Forest, Krasnoyarsk Abstract Regional tree-ring chronology with extension 2209 years (since 212 B.C. till 1996 A.D.) was built for the east of Taymir according to wood of living trees, well preserved residues of dead trees and semi-fossil wood from alluvial bank deposits by the cross-dating method. In addition the \"floading\" tree-ring width chronology for the period of Holocene Optimum (3300-2600 B.C.) was built with extention 685 years and supported by several rdiocarbon dates. High values of synchrony and correlation of individual tree-ring series show a prevailing effect of one external factor on radial tree growth change in the studied region of Siberian subarctic. It was established that the main factor of growth variability the early summer and annual temperature is which explains up to 70% of tree growth rate variability. Cyclic components stable for two millennia were revealed at analysis of the tree-ring chronology: double secular (about 180 years), secular (78-90) and intrasecular (44, 28, 11 and 6,7-6,9 years) variations. Models for reconstruction of the early summer and annual air temperature were obtained according to tree growth variability. Temperature dynamics in the eastern part of Taymir for the last two millenia agrees well with temperature variations in the northern hemisphere obtained according to other indirect sources. The warming of the middle of the 20-th century is not extraordinary. The more long in time, and close in amplitude the warming at the border of the first and the second millennia was. Key words: radial growth, tree-ring chronologies, temperature change, dendrochronology, climate, growth cyclicity, temperature reconstruction, response functions. Introduction The leading dendrochronological groups began their work in some key regions of circumpolar zone of the northern hemisphere on building the superlong (several millennia, and for the whole Holocene period if to use subfossil wood) tree-ring chronologies for the quantitative reconstruction of natural temperature variations [6,8,19,20,35,36]. The high latitudinal regions in the northern hemisphere are of greatest interest for assessing natural and anthropogenic variations of air temperature, forest-tundra ecosystem growth and productivity, regeneration regime as well as of polar timberline dynamics because the ecosystems of high latitudes have the highest sensibility to the expected global climate warming [4,15,18,19,22,43]. Owing to accessibility and great amount of well-preserved wood of dead trees as well as of subfossil wood from alluvial river deposits and wood buried in bogs several regions in high latitudes of Russia turned to be promising for building millennial chronologies: the Polar Urals [15,31], Yamal peninsula [32], the east of Taymir and Putoran [7,8,14] and the lower Indigirka river[34]. The following problems were solved in the given paper: 1) obtaining of the absolutely dated 2000 year tree-ring chronology suitable for quantitative reconstruction of climate changes; 2) revealing of the main climatic factor responsible for the year-to-year and long -term growth variability; 3) building of models of climate change reconstruction for the whole period of long tree-ring chronology. Material and methods Dendrochronological material was collected in Kheta-Khatanga plain as well as in Moyero-Kotuy plateau regions of the Middle-Siberian forest zone within the northern stripe of the northern taiga subzone [1] (Fig.1). The wood samples were taken with the help of a borer or chainsaw from the living trees, from the well preserved residues of a dead and subfossil wood. The whole sampled material is from trees from three types of conditions: 1) from the contemporary northern timberline of larch in the stow (urotchishche) Ary-Mas of the Taymir biospheric reservation (latitude of 72 28' N.); 2) from contemporary upper timberline with absolute marks 200-300 m above sea level in the Kotuy river valley (latitude of 70 30'-71 00' N.); 3) from alluvial deposits of flood-land and over-flood-land terraces of large tributaries of the Khatanga river (latitude of 70 30'- 73 00'N.). Measuring of the tree-ring width was made with the help of automatized devices with resolution up to 0.001 mm, and later the measured individual tree-ring chronologies were treated in the standard software package for dendrochronological and dendroclimatological analysis [26,33]. Owing to the high year-to-year variability, high synchrony of individual series between each other the results of the cross dating gave a chance to build the continuous chronology since the year 212 B.C. till 1996 A.D., it means the total length 2209 years. Besides, according to the well-cross-dated discs of subfossil wood for which the series of radiocarbon dates was made at the University of Bern (Switzerland) and at the Joint Institute of Geology, Geophysics and Mineralogy SB RAS (Novosibirsk) the \"floading\" chronology of 685 years long was obtained which according to the dates agreed with climatic optimum of the Holocene (3300-2600 years B.C.). Standartization method is used to treat individual series for the best revealing of climatic signal. This method is intended to remove the changes caused by age or by factors of the non-climatic nature (for example, effect of phytocoenotic factors) from tree-ring width variability. For standartization two approaches were used: 1) an approximating curve of age variations is tried for every individual series [15,26]; 2) an age curve is used which is built according to the entire totality of analysed individual curves of growth [3,11,21,23]. As the special studies showed, the long climatic changes (or super-secular variations) remain more reliably at the second standartization method [21]. Therefore, it was chosen for standartization of individual series and obtaining of the long chronology of tree-ring indexes. Obtaining of regional tree-ring chronology (C1) and of the so-called \"residual\" series (C2), from which autocorrelation was removed [26,40], was as a result of individual series standartization. The main statistic characteristics were calculated for the obtained chronologies: inter-series coefficient of correlation (as an index of synchrony of individual series), sensitivity coefficient, standard deviation,1-st order autocorrelation etc.[30,41]. Analysis of the frequency-temporal structure of obtained chronologies at the entire period and at the 500-year intervals was carried out by Fourie method of direct transforming (Blackman-Tyuki method) and Fourie method of \"fast or inverse transforming\" (Kuli-Tyuki method) [10]. The methods of graphical assessment of smoothed curves [15,16], analysis of autocorrelational function [2,15], a narrow-striped filtering of series [12] were used at the revealing of long (super-secular) cycles in growth variability. Revealing of the main climatic factors of growth variability was based on response function assessing and interpreting [30,42]. The quantitative reconstruction of climatic factors according to variability of growth indexes was made on the base of calculated regression model at which building one part of climatic series was used for calibration, another part - for verification [6,7,41]. Adequacy of reconstruction model was assessed by standard statistic indexes: correlation coefficient, Fisher's criterion, autocorrelation of residues - criterion of Darbin-Watson [17]. Results In the result of the cross dating (its quality was checked by statistic estimates according to the COFECHA program [26,33]) of Larix gmelini living trees and trees dead long ago from the upper timberline as well as of subfossil wood from alluvial deposits the reginal tree-ring chronology since the year 212 B.C. till 1996 A.D. was built for the eastern part of Taymir and Putoran. The total number of wood samples being dated was 118, including 27 living and 91 dead trees. The average age of the used trees made 300 years, the maximum age was 798 years. The percentage of the missing rings is not very large - only 0,5% because the discs were analysed, mainly, but not wood cores [44]. The tree number in the regional chronology is not homogeneous in calendar scale and has a tendency to decrease when moving to the past: 3 and more models since the year 135 B.C., 5 and more models since the year 81 B.C. Dating of dead trees showed that in the upper timberline under continental climate the dead tree residues can remain on the day surface during more than 1900 years. Inter-series correlation coefficient for the whole time period is rather higher than the threshold value (0,62- 0,75, p < 0,01). It confirms a stable and strong external influence which synchronizes growth variability of individual trees. The main statistic C1 chronology for the whole period and in 500- year intervals are given in the Table 1. The high and close coefficient values of sensitivity and standard deviation for the different time intervals show that tree growth variability under these conditions is controlled by one and the same factor during two millennia. Autocorrelation of the first order which shows the growth effect of the previous year on the growth in the next year is of great importance as well. Autocorrelation is not significant after treating it by autoregression model in C2. The average tree-ring width for two thousand years is at the level 0,28 mm but it greatly varies in time, the average tree-ring width is more high (0,40 mm) for the Holocene optimum period (Fig.3). Radiocarbon datings agree well with absolute dendrochronological data. Analysis of spectral density allowed to show the frequency stripes important by their contribution to the total growth variability and to assess their amplitude (Table 2). The contribution of millennial cyclic component makes about 4%. The large contribution is brought by double secular cycle (in frequency stripe of 120-220 years) up to 20,6% and secular cycle (in frequency stripe of 60-120 years) - up to 13,3%. The cross-spectral analysis of the 500 year old fragments of chronology showed that during two millennia the double secular (180 years), secular (78-90 years) and several intrasecular (44,28,11 6,7- 6,9 years) cycles are steadily present. Hereat, re-distribution in the capacity of separate cyclic components is observed. Such a re-distribution was already noted in the papers on dendroclimatic data from boreal taiga forests and forest-tundra regions [2,12,15]. Positive anomalies of growth, the most strong in amplitude and long in time, fall on the 4-th century, the border of the 6-th and 7-th centuries, the border of the 1-st and 2-nd millennia, the middle of the 20-th century. However, the negative anomalies fall on the 1-st century, the border of the 13-th and 14-th centuries and the first half of the 19-th century. These anomalies can be explained by superposition of cycles of different length. So, growth increase in the middle of the 20-th century agreed with positive periods of the double secular, secular, and several intrasecular cycles (44, 11, and 6,7 years). Since at the polar timberline the summer temperature is the main factor of growth limiting [6, 15,35,43], then the dendroclimatic analysis of relation of growth variability was carried out, first of all, with air temperature data for summer period. However, some changes were brought to the traditional searching scheme of correlation with average monthly temperature data.In order to reveal the key interval of the season when temperature mainly affected on radial tree growth the value of correlation coefficient between C2 growth indexes and air temperature for every five days beginning from the 8-th of May was calculated. Everyday data of the Khatanga meteorological station since 1933 to 1989 were used. All the calculations are given in the Fig.4. As we see, the significant positive connection (p<0,01) between air temperature for every five days and growth indexes is observed for the period since June 17 to July 11 and it falls on the interval of stable temperature rise in the season. The temperature of the more late intervals of the season does not show large connection with growth variations. The temperature for the period June 17 -July 11 we called as an early summer temperature. Temperature sum for this time period shows the most correlation with C2 tree-ring indices (R=0,77). Thus, variability of C2 tree-ring indexes is determined by the early summer temperature variability in the east of Taymir and Putoran by 60%. The smoothed (the 5-year moving average) C1 tree-ring indexes and instrumental values of average annual air temperature show high agreement too (R=0,72). At the same time the smoothed annual temperature shows the significant relationship with the concordance coefficient calculated for the same period of 5 years based on all wood samples available. This relationship is positive (R=0.44,p<0.01) and shows that in cool periods the synchrony in tree-ring variations among all trees measured becames lower, in warm periods it becomes higher, but has a non-significant relation to tree-ring width variations. Therefore, at seaching of quantitative models of reconstruction of leading climatic variables using tree-ring chronologies it was conventionally taken to use C2 for the early summer temperature reconstruction, and C1 - for the annual temperature reconstruction. The results of calibration and verification of obtained models of the early summer and average annual temperature reconstruction according to 2000-year chronologies data are given in the Table 3 and in the Fig.5. As we can see, the early summer temperature variability is well explained by tree-ring indexes variability in C2 (R^2 =0,59 - 0,72), the average annual temperature variability is described by the model with two variables: by smoothed values of tree-ring indexes in C1 and by concordance coefficient values between individual series (R^2 =0,67) (Fig.5). Comparison of calculated values of the early summer and average annual temperatures with the real ones for the period of instrumental observations shows (Fig.5) that the calculated values of the early summer temperature agree well with the year-to-year variability of real values repeating the most large positive (1940-41, 1953, 1967,1979, 1984) and negative (1947, 1949, 1980, 1989) extremes. Hereat, in the curves of the early summer temperature variability the long fluctuations are not expressed. To the contrary, the periods of large temperature rise (1938-1956,1983-1989) and temperature fall (the end of (19)50s and (19)70s clearly agree in reconstructed and real values of average annual temperature. Based on the obtained models according to two chronologies the reconstruction of the early summer and average annual air temperature was made for the east of Taymir and Putoran for the period since the year 81 B.C. to the present time (it means, for the period provided by 5 and more samples). The curves of variability of the reconstructed early summer temperature (smoothed by the 5-year and 57-year moving average) are given in the Fig.6. The average value of the early summer temperature equals to 9,6 C for the instrumental observation period. The most large fall of the early summer temperature is marked in the 1-st century (T=8,4 C), and in the end of the 13-th century (8,4 C). The most warm periods with the raised average early summer temperature are the end of the 3-rd century (T=9,7 C), the border of two millennia (9,6 C), the middle of the 20-th century (9,9 C). The middle of the 20-th century is characterized by the most rise of the early summer temperature, but the 11-th and 12-th centuries are characterized by the long period with high early summer temperatures. Long variations of the average annual temperature range from minus 14 C to minus 12,5 C. It was of great interest for average annual temperature to compare the reconstruction data with other indirect data on dynamics of average annual air temperature of the northern hemisphere in order to make clear whether temperature variations in the east of Taymir and Putoran reflect global temperature changes in the northern hemisphere. As such the data on reconstruction of temperature variation in high latitudes according to ratio of oxygen isotopes in ice cores of Greenland were used [25,29]. In the Fig.7 both reconstructions are matched in the calendar scale since the late of the 12-th century. Their good agreement is well seen, especially in positive (the 14-th and 15-th centuries, the end of the 18-th and the middle of the 20-th centuries) and in negative (the late of the 13-th and of the 17-th centuries, and the first half of the 19-th) extremes. It means, the long fluctuations of average annual temperature in the east of Taymir and Putoran agree well with global air temperature variations of the northern hemisphere for the last millennium, and hence the tree-ring chrnology of this region can be used to analyse both regional peculiarities and global temperature variations in the northern hemisphere. Discussion and conclusions The results of analysis of the super-long tree-ring chronology of the Taymir and Putoran east show that the information on the main climate changes in the northern hemisphere for the last 2000 years is reliably fixed in it: fall of temperature in the first century, climate warming in the 3-rd and 4-th centuries, warming in the Medival Warm Period (?) or \"the small climatic optimum\" at the border of two millennia, the long fall of temperature in the 17-th and 19-th centuries (\"the small glacial period\") and the present climate warming in the middle of the 20-th century [27]. Since the obtained regional chronology has good correlations with other chronologies of subarctic zone within 500- 600 km [6,43], then we can believe that similar regularities of the early summer and average annual temperature variability are typical of large sector of Siberian subarctic. It was shown earlier that the long growth variations agree well for the entire Siberian subarctic [8,24]. The studied region (and this is shown by subfossil wood samples and by obtained \"floating\" chronology) has a high potential to build the tree-ring chronology for the whole Holocene period and to study in details temperature variations for this period of the Earth history. Two important consequenses from reconstruction analysis should be noted especially. First, the analysis of frequency structure of series and of their separate fragments illustrates a constancy of the main environmental factors limiting growth. It is confirmed also by comparing reconstructions with other indirect evidences. Second, the warming in the middle of the 20-th century, marked as extraordinary [22], has the analogs in the past. So, the warming at the border of millennia shows a close amplitude and was more long [27,38]. Historical evidences on climate of this Medival Warm period say about the more large climate warming than the present one [13]. The obtained data demonstrate that temperature variations in high latitudes for the instrumental period (1850- 1990) do not go far beyond limits of natural variations revealed during two millennia. Ratio of natural and anthropogenic components in the present and future climate changes is especially discussed. It is proved in some papers based on the long tree-ring chronologies of North America that the influence of anthropogenic component becomes large and can be separated and assessed quantitatively [39]. Hereat, the trees growing above the upper or polar timberline reflect stable temperature rise in the northern hemisphere [28,35,37]. However, a direct correlation between temperature and growth is marked only for trees from growth regime especially chosen [36,37]. The stable trend of summer and especially winter temperatures for the last decades is connected with the increase of anthropogenic component share, mainly, at the expense of atmospheric green-house gases [4]. At the same time, on large areas of high latitudes (mainly, in subarctic zone) tree growth, correlating well with temperature rise till (19)60s, begins to stunt after this period from the rise of temperature [24]. We can believe that the direct temperature effect is combined with other factors which influence growth rate of trees in polar latitudes. For instance, increase of winter precipitation can shift the dates of snow cover melting to the more late time even at summer temperature rise [9]. In polar latitudes the conditions of the first season half play the leading role in radial tree growth and tree-ring forming [5,6]. Therefore, tree growth response at the polar timberline will be more complex than we can expect only from summer temperature variations. Conclusions 1. The long 2209-year (since the year 212 B.C. till 1996 A.D) regional tree-ring chronology was obtained for the east of Taymir and Putoran, suitable for quantitative dendroclimatic analysis and climate change reconstruction. Numerous radiocarbon data of sub- fossil wood and several built \"floating\" chronologies show a high potential of dendrochronological material of the given region for the building of absolute tree-ring chronology for the main Holocene period (more than 6000 years). 2. The main factors were established which determined the year-to-year variability as well as long-term variability of larch growth in the study region. They are the early summer and average annual air temperature and they determine up to 70% of the total growth variability. 3. In long-term growth variability during two millennia the millennial, the double secular and secular cycles as well as some intrasecular cycles which are met the most often in tree growth variability in polar latitudes of the northern hemisphere are steadily seen. The most large warmings and falls of temperature can be explained by matching particular cycles. 4. Reconstruction of the early summer and average annual temperature variations in the east of Taymir and Putoran showed good agreement of temperature variations in the given region with temperature variations in the northern hemisphere obtained in other indirect sources. The warming in the middle of the 20-th century is not extraordinary. The warming at the border of the 1-st and 2-nd millennia was more long in time and similar in amplitude.

Most complete reference for our industry! Click on the picture above to learn more about the equipment! The Industry Forum Issue #136 10341Forum Members #136-1: Dik M, PA It would be much more useful to the industry, if SPFA would help find a \"CODE CONFORMING\" fire barrier for attics, crawl spaces etc., than lecture on Fast and Loose applications of code. Something about 30 cents (a BD. FT.) installed, meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products, report results to SPFA, who in turn will \"acquire funding\" from US. #136-2 William B, Australia we are in Australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of Australian contractors \/suppliers ????or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline@powerup.com.au, it is for the better of the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members,also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name #136-3 Ed M. I am a writer for aviation magazines and one that I write for is a Test International, a new publication that just launched this month. I need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft, particularly commercial aviation. #136-4 John C, Louisiana I have a Foam Cat 2000 Graco machine and a Probler gun with a 01 tip. I use this setup to spray truck bed liners. My question is can I and how do I spray foam insulation using my equipment? And what are the different types of insulation? #136-5 Murph Mahaffey, Glas-Craft I like the new look of the Industry Forum! #136-6 Mark W, South Carolina I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a \"thermal Barrier\". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT. IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure, so what? Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real, inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN! As for the vaunted R rating system, IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do. Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they're still selling everybody. There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers & coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose. Think about it. #136-7 Dirk Benthien, Forum Moderator Thank you, Mark and Dik, for your statements above. I also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them - even if everybody knows they do not make sense. We are all experts and representatives of this industry and should speak up and promote change! #136-8 Martin S, Canada Does anyone make a dispensing machine for crumb rubber \/ urethane blends ? #136-9 Carole L, California re #135-8 Otto V, Germany What are the answers? (Phase-out of 141b) #136-10 Brian D, Canada There has been a lot of talk about ceramic coatings. We are a distributor of such a coating. We have never professed an R-20. Reason = is there isn't an ASTM test available to measure coatings for R-value. We compare standardized insulation to Ceramic coatings via BTU loss calculations. Depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket. We have the data and the projects to prove it. #136-11 CPI We have inquiries from a number of people for used equipment - especially Gusmer H20\/35, H2000, H2, GX-7 and Glas-Craft Probler.

Kidsave's Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older child. In 1999 and 2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program. The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or family-like environments. We are looking for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp program happen for these 250 children. As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the money to bring these children here and find them families. Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948 or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's Kidsave program. Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

{"text":"Hi all - I'm not too comfortable with this, and would rather not sign - at least not without some real time to think it through and debate the issue. It is unprecedented and political, and that worries me. My vote would be that we don't do this without a careful discussion first. I think it would be more appropriate for the AGU or some other scientific org to do this - e.g., in reaffirmation of the AGU statement (or whatever it's called) on global climate change. Think about the next step - someone sends another letter to the Senators, then we respond, then... I'm not sure we want to go down this path. It would be much better for the AGU etc to do it. What are the precedents and outcomes of similar actions? I can imagine a special-interest org or group doing this like all sorts of other political actions, but is it something for scientists to do as individuals? Just seems strange, and for that reason I'd advise against doing anything with out real thought, and certainly a strong majority of co-authors in support. Cheers, Peck Dear fellow Eos co-authors, Given the continued assault on the science of climate change by some on Capitol Hill, Michael and I thought it would be worthwhile to send this letter to various members of the U.S. Senate, accompanied by a copy of our Eos article.

From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Friday, April 29, 2016 12:13 PM To: Freundlich, Christina; Walker, Eric; Walsh, Tom; Paustenbach, Mark Cc: RR2 Subject: FOR REVIEW: -- Senate Judiciary Misses Key Milestone Under GOP Obstruction SL: Senate Judiciary Misses Key Milestone Under GOP Obstruction It's been 44 47 days of Republican obstruction since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, meaning that this last week marked the average amount of time it takes the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on a nominee to the Supreme Court. That's an unprecedented failure on the part of Republican Senators to do their job. The Constitution is clear: it's the President's job to nominate Supreme Court justices, and it's the Senate's job to advise and consent, giving a nominee a fair consideration with a hearing and vote. Not in our modern political system has it taken this long to fulfill a Supreme Court vacancy, let alone refuse to give the nominee a fair hearing a vote. Ironically, the obstruction comes as And yet, some Republican lawmakers are still refusing to acknowledge Trump as their standard bearer baron for the Republican party, even as he tightens his grip on the GOP nomination. It's striking that even as they tacitly acknowledge that Trump lacks the judgment and temperament to serve as President, the and the one they are waiting for to Republican Senators are refusing to do their own job in order to hand Trump the responsibility to nominate a Supreme Court justice. Last week, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley even admitted that it would be \"a gamble\" to let Trump fill the vacancy. That disconnect is partly why the American people are increasingly opposed to the Republican obstruction, and want Republican Senators to do their job and allow a hearing and a vote. \u00b7 52% of voters now believe Republican Senators should do their job and vote on the nomination of Chief Judge Garland this year, up from 43% in February. \u00b7 Americans overwhelmingly oppose Donald Trump or Ted Cruz making the next appointment, with 62% saying they do not trust Trump and 57% saying they do not trust Cruz to nominate a Supreme Court justice. \u00b7 Vulnerable Republican Senators are also starting to see the negative effects of their unprecedented obstruction. In New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte's support for the Republican leadership's refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland has hurt her in the eyes of voters, with her net favorability rating dropping 13 points since February. In Ohio, 59% of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Senator Rob Portman's decision to block Chief Judge Garland's nomination. And in Pennsylvania, 62% of voters want the Senate to hold hearings and a vote on the nomination, corresponding to a rise in Senator Pat Toomey's unfavorability rating . Republicans have chosen to play politics rather than do their jobs and fulfill the most basic constitutional requirements. The gridlock and dysfunction coming from Republicans in the Senate is exactly why the American people are tired of Washington. And their message couldn't be clearer: stop the obstruction and do your job.

Feedback, notes and comments ------------------------------------------------------------------- MACHINIMA My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all places, I misspelled it \"mechanima\", thus confusing everybody. APPETITE OVER TIN CUP Several replies came in about this saying, confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying \"head over heels\" are widely known, especially \"ass over appetite\" from the US, where \"appetite\" may be a transferred term for the mouth. But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about, \"appetite over tin cup\", seems not to be known much at all. It would seem to be a conflation of the British expression \"arse over teakettle\" and the American \"ass over appetite\" (note my deliberate use of the two spellings of \"arse\" here!). The saying was probably modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression, which itself is now not very common. BUMBERSHOOT Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\": Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo You can have me hat or me bumbershoot But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo It may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.

A review by Jonathon Green is scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the date again). See for more details and UK ordering information. 2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud ------------------------------------------------------------------- As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Ni\u00f1o season, UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants, carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15% of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain, leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just Asia. The term \"Asian Brown Cloud\" seems to have been around for a couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more efficient ways of burning fuels. The \"Asian Brown Cloud,\" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates. [\"Los Angeles Times\", Aug. 2002] A UN-backed study released on Friday said the \"Asian Brown Cloud\" - a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the population. [\"Agence France Presse\", Aug. 2002] 3. Weird Words: Pyknic \/'pIknIk\/ ------------------------------------------------------------------- Short and fat. Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way as \"picnic\". In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses. Tall and thin ones he called \"asthenic\" (or \"leptosomic\") and considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft. A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The third sort were the \"pyknic\" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were concerned. He took \"pyknic\" from Greek \"puknos\", thick or close- packed; it appeared first in his book \"K\u00f6rperbau und Charakter\" (Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into English. The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body types - \"endomorph\", \"mesomorph\" and \"ectomorph\" - that are now more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came up with the phrase \"pyknic practical joke\" to describe a person who is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and balloons out into obesity. 4. Q&A ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the \"New York Times\" that made mention of a \"mash note\". I had never heard this term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note. Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane Rosenthal, California] A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase. We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was the word \"mash\" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the 1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as \"a deep but fleeting affection of the heart\"). A \"mash\" could also be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex, to flirt or seduce. A \"masher\" was a man who thought himself irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often unwelcome. The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the \"Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang\" and by others suggests that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre. Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his \"Hans Breitmann's Ballads\" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem, \"The Masher\", dated about 1895, confirming this: The word to \"mash,\" in the sense of causing love or attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress was often fined for \"mashing\" or smiling at men in the audience. \"Mash\" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about 1880. \"Masher\" in particular became a term in London society, especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing away its collective skirts) as \"a fop of affected manners and exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'\", noting that the word had been common \"in 1882 and for a few years after\". In a letter from London in the old \"Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine\" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an impoverished theatrical company: \"This dashing youth was distinctly conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a far higher class\". A \"mash note\" (in its first appearances, \"mash letter\") was an obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in 1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well. Where \"mash\" and its relatives come from has been a subject of debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some people derived it from \"Ma Ch\u00e8re\", \"the mode of address used by the gilded youth to the barmaids of the period\". But he thought it really came from \"the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing Montmorency of the day.'\" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong, but he could hardly know that. Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely accepted: It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors, C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word \"masher\" or \"mash\" means in that tongue to allure, delude, or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be no doubt as to the gypsy origin of \"mash\" as used on the stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well- known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of it years before the term had become at all popular. Though defunct in British English, \"mash\" and \"masher\" have never quite gone away in America. \"Mash\" had a resurgence of popularity as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting, though that may be a back-formation from \"mash note\". 5.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past past about the first 1\/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I fry? As it turns out, it was another case of \"always check the small stuff\". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message like every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How appropriate...

GnomeSYSTEM ATI Still Makes Video Cards? Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re- entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their driver development has improved as much as their hardware seems to have.

Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks.

GnomeSTUFF Yer Kidding... Really? I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder. Recommend It!

{"text":"Dear Irina, The code we used in Mann\/Bradley\/Hughes 1998 was not changed or \"improved\", but there may be different versions of the code floating around, and in a previous email to Uli Cubasch, I indicated that I was not sure the version you have (from Tim Osborn), is identifical to the version we used in our original paper (it would require some work on my part to insure it gives precisely the same results, and I don't have the time to do that). I suspect, however, that the code is the same as the one we used in our paper and any differences, if they exist, should be minor (as long as the code compiles and runs correctly on the platform you have--the possible platform-dependence of fortran is a potential cause for concern here). Numerous people have coded up our method independently, including Ed Zorita, w\/ whom I believe your group has a close collaboration, and my graduate student Zhang has successfully coded this up independently in Matlab (its a short script, which didn't take Zhang long to write anyway). I'm copying this message to Zhang, so that he can provide you with his matlab version of the code if you are interested. Because Zhang's version is in Matlab, it should run correctly, independently of the particular platform (an advantage over the fortran code) [As an aside, on a pedagogical note, I would still encourage you to code this up yourself]. As I indicated in a previous email to Uli, the selection of the optimal subset of EOFS to retain is not automated in the code, and you need to do that yourself...The methodology we used is described in detail in our publications. We have tested this method against the approach our group now uses for climate field reconstruction (Schneider RegEM approach), and find that the results are similar, but the cross-validation statistics improve slightly w\/ the RegEM approach, which we now favor and use in place of the old, Mann et al approach. Details of this latter approach are described in these two manuscripts (as well as the original paper by Schneider referenced within): Mann, M.E., Rutherford, S., Climate Reconstruction Using 'Pseudoproxies', Geophysical Research Letters, 29 (10), 1501, doi: 10.1029\/2001GL014554, 2002. available at: [1]ftp:\/\/holocene.evsc.virginia.edu\/pub\/mann\/Pseudoproxy02.[2]pdf Rutherford, S., Mann, M.E., Delworth, T.L., Stouffer, R., Climate Field Reconstruction Under Stationary and Nonstationary Forcing, Journal of Climate, 16, 462-479, 2003. available at: [3]ftp:\/\/holocene.evsc.virginia.edu\/pub\/mann\/Rutherfordetal-Jclim03.pdf The RegEM code is available over the web, and Scott Rutherford can provide you with the ftp side if you are interested.

Sadly, his comments were only the latest in a series of misogynistic, degrading remarks that he's made about women. Surely everyone can agree that this is not the type of example a public school teacher should be setting. \"At this point an apology won't cut it. It's time for Sutton to resign. The Republican Party of Florida and the Republican National Committee share in the blame for tolerating this type of embarrassing behavior. Sutton can't help himself and the Party of Trump is willing to enable him. This just shows that the Republican Party remains all talk and no action when it comes to reaching out to women and minorities.\" ###","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Neville, You mentioned to me some time ago that in your view, the 11-year solar cycle did not influence temperature. There have been numerous attempts by academics to establish a correlation, but each has been shot down on some ground or other. I remember Barrie Pittock was especially dismissive of attempts to correlate solar cycle with temperature. Have you tried this approach? Load \"Mathematica\" into your PC and run the following set of instructions - data = ReadList[ \"c:\\sydney.txt\", Number] dataElements = Length[data] X = ListPlot[ data, PlotJoined-> True]; fourierTrans = Fourier[data]; ListPlot[Abs[fourierTrans], PlotJoined -> True]; fitfun1 = Fit[data,{1,x,x^2,x^3,Sin[11 2 Pi x\/dataElements], Cos[11 2 Pi x\/dataElements]},x]; fittable = Table[N[fitfun1], {x, dataElements}]; Y = ListPlot[fittable, PlotJoined -> True]; Show[X, Y] The reference to \"c:\\sydney.txt\" is a suggested pathname for the following set of data - which is Sydney's annual mean temperature. 16.8 16.5 16.8 17 17 16.7 17.1 17.4 17.9 17.4 17.2 17.1 16.9 17 17.2 17.2 17.4 17.6 17.6 17.6 16.7 17.1 16.8 17.4 16.8 17.3 17.8 17.5 17.1 17.2 17.6 17.3 17.1 16.9 16.9 17.3 17.3 17.3 17.6 17.5 17.4 17.2 17.1 17.3 17.2 17.2 16.9 17.5 17.4 17.2 17 17.5 17.4 17.5 17.7 18.3 17.8 17.4 17.2 17.4 18.3 17.3 18 18.1 18 17.5 17.3 18 17 18.2 17.4 17.6 17.5 17.4 17.1 17.4 17.3 17.5 17.7 18 17.8 18 17.4 17.8 16.8 17.5 17.4 17.6 17.6 17.2 17.4 17.9 17.9 17.6 17.7 17.8 17.7 17.6 17.8 18.3 18 17.6 17.8 17.8 17.8 18.1 17.9 17.5 17.8 18.3 18 17.7 17.3 17.5 18.5 17.4 17.8 17.7 17.8 17.7 18 18.5 18.2 17.8 18.1 17.5 17.8 17.8 18 18.6 18.1 18.1 18.6 So Far so good. \"Mathematica\" first plots out the data itself (see Atachment 1) The first part of the instruction set lets \"mathematica\" do a Fourier Transform on the data, ie. searching out the periodicities, if there are any. The result is shown on Attachment 2. The transform result shows a sharp spike at the 11 year point (I wonder what is significant about 11 years?). The second part of the instructions now acts upon this observed spike (the Cos 11 bit), to extract it's waveform from the rest of the noise. The result is shown as a waveform in attachment 3, the waves having an 11-year period, with the long-term Sydney warming easily evident. Attachment 4 shows the original Sydney data overlaid against the 11-year periodicity. It would appear that the solar cycle does indeed affect temperature. (I tried the same run on the CRU global temperature set. Even though CRU must be highly smoothed by the time all the averages are worked out, the 11-year pulse is still there, albeit about half the size of Sydneys). Stay cool.

{"text":"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS West Power On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp. The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility. The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project. The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002. This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities. Congratulations to everyone who made it a success. Enron Freight Markets Enron Freight Markets closed its first firm sale of transportation with Penske Logistics. Penske is under contract for the operation and U.S. distribution of Whirlpool appliances. EFM will provide truckload capacity for Penske to serve Whirlpool. The first lane that EFM will begin handling is from the southern California distribution center in Ontario, California to various northern California destinations.

News from the Global Flash EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities. Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: \"Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia.\" German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the \"heart land\" of Germany. Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul. Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company. True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels. Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted: 'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.' The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition: \"The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,\" explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner. \"Other \"Raider Class\" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.\" While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation! Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

{"text":"Ben, there are two very different things going on here. One is technical and related to the actual science and the actual statistics, the second is political, and is much more concerned with how incidents like this can be portrayed. The second is the issue here. The unfortunate fact is that the 'secret science' meme is an extremely powerful rallying call to people who have no idea about what is going on. Claiming (rightly or wrongly) that information is being hidden has a huge amount of resonance (as you know), much more so than whether Douglass et al know their statistical elbow from a hole in the ground. Thus any increase in publicity on this - whether in the pages of Nature or elsewhere - is much more likely to bring further negative fallout despite your desire to clear the air. Whatever you say, it will still be presented as you hiding data. The contrarians have found that there is actually no limit to what you can ask people for (raw data, intermediate steps, additional calculations, residuals, sensitivity calculations, all the code, a workable version of the code on any platform etc.), and like Somali pirates they have found that once someone has paid up, they can always shake them down again. Thus, I would not advise any public statements on this. Instead, email you immediate superiors and the director with a short statement along the lines of what you suggest below (i.e. of course you want open science, the data *are* in the public domain (with links) and calls for more intermediate steps are just harassment to prevent scientists doing what they are actually paid too). I wouldn't put in anything specifically related to McIntyre. A much more satisfying response would be to demonstrate how easy it is to replicate the analysis in the paper starting from scratch using openly available data (such as through Joe Sirott's portal) and the simplest published MSU weighting function. If you can show that this can be done in a couple of hours (or whatever), it makes the other side look like incompetent amateurs. Maybe someone has a graduate student available....?

{"text":"Okay - clean version below with all of Jeremy's fixes. Jenna \/ Rachel pls blast out to national, af am, Hispanic, aapi, young voters, women. Thanks! SL: 2016 is going so badly for the RNC, they put out a second autopsy over the weekend. Sad! Body: Here it is . You may have missed it, seeing as the RNC only publicized their second autopsy in a tweet from their Communications Director on a Saturday afternoon. No release, no blog post, no tweets from the RNC's official accounts. This is a big departure from the fanfare used to roll out their first autopsy . We don't have time to get into all of the pathetic white-washing in this document so we've just picked out a few of the best passages for you: * Page 5: \"The Republican opportunity has also been strengthened and expanded because of the Republican National Committee's Growth and Opportunity Project and the bold changes which grew out of it and which Chairman Priebus has implemented vigorously.\" We're curious - which \"bold changes\" has Chairman Priebus implemented vigorously? And how has the GOP opportunity been \"strengthened and expanded?\" Because from where we're sitting - the GOP hasn't been this unpopular since the 90s , their standard-bearer has the highest disapproval rating of any nominee in history, and newspapers are literally holding funerals for the GOP on the front page. * Page 9: \"Words and Ideas Matter. 1. The wrong words cripple or kill.\" Donald Trump may think he has \"the best words ,\" but calling Mexicans \"rapists,\" saying you \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women who have abortions, and refusing to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe sound like some pretty crippling words and ideas. * Page 11: \"Training our own candidates to avoid major mistakes becomes a much more important requirement for an effective campaign.\" Trump has already said he's not going to change his approach in the election, so any hope of the GOP \"training\" him to avoid major mistakes does not pass the laugh test. Looks like you just can't teach an old, xenophobic and sexist candidate new tricks. * Page 11: \"That narrative should be reflected in the GOP platform and at the convention and should be reflected in the messaging that is communicated electronically to every candidate and campaign in the country so there can be a unified chorus driving home the winning narrative and the winning choice.\" With every Republican nominee from the 21st century agreeing to skip the convention, and given the current personal feud between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, is there any phrase that is less applicable to the GOP right now than \"unified chorus?\" * Page 13: \"Quality Campaigns Still Matter\" Amen. With the Trump operation getting dominated by the Cruz team in state-and-local level delegate fights, Republicans have to be feeling just fantastic about their frontrunner's organization and ground game. * Page 17: \"Republicans have the opportunity to perform better among single women, younger voters, Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans.\" Trump is viewed unfavorably by 63 percent of Asian-Americans , 91 percent of African-Americans, 81 percent of Latino-Americans, 75 percent of women and 74 percent of younger voters. [ Can't wait to see what the RNC comes up with in their third autopsy.","label":0}

{"text":"From: DNC Press Sent: Wednesday, April 27, 2016 1:58 PM To: DNC Press Subject: What Some Had to Say About Trump's Incoherent Foreign Policy Speech Donald Trump proved today that a teleprompter can't help him sound reasonable or knowledgeable when it comes to foreign policy. He continues to lack the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. The \"new\" Donald Trump is the same Donald Trump we have seen on the campaign trail over the past year - a candidate that lacks details, alarms foreign leaders, and has no place in the White House. Just look at what some had to say about Trump's incoherent foreign policy remarks: @LindseyGrahamSC: Not sure who is advising Trump on foreign policy but I can understand why he's not revealing their names. @LindseyGrahamSC: Question #1 for Trump: Are we sure the guy running the teleprompter has the pages in the right order? #notmakinganysense @LindseyGrahamSC: Question #2 -- Did teleprompter guy actually write the speech? #notmakinganysense @LindseyGrahamSC: Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face. @timkmak : How can such a prewritten, rehearsed speech be filled with so many errors and internal contradictions @timkmak: Trump's contradiction: --Allies must pay for their own defense --We must stick by our agreement with allies (just not security assurances) @fmkaplan: Even by Trump standards, this is thumpingly incoherent and ignorant. @JakeSherman: Donald Trump just called Tanzania \"Tanzaynia\" @joshgreenman: 1. Start trade war with China 2. Seek common ground based on shared interests with China @ThePlumLineGS: After saying we need to be more \"unpredictable,\" Trump says the secret to successful foreign policy is consistency. @BenjySarlin: After literally threatening to end alliances over a funding dispute, Trump pivots to saying our allies no longer think they can depend on us @ZekeJMiller: The big question hanging over pretty much every line of this Trump speech: How? @thefix: To say this Trump foreign policy speech is light on specifics is an insult to specifics. @WayneSlater: Trump reading his foreign policy address off the Teleprompter looks like a 10-year-old trying to speak in a second language. @BenjySarlin: Trump just seems to staple GOP talking points about foreign policy onto his own foreign policy, which is totally incompatible with them View this post on our Factivists site here .","label":0}

I have not acquired a registered membership in your organization as of yet but I assure you that I have the qualifications you are looking for. In fact, I am compelled to jump on this opportunity before someone less qualified does! I am a public speaker, excellent writer, avid reader, youth educator and college educated corporate professional all in one. I am at my best when I am leading, educating and influencing members of my beloved race. To give you just a bit of personal info; even in today's world I have acheived many personal goals that once seemed impossible to me, until I put all of my energy and efforts into bettering my quality of life. Frankly, that is all it took; persistence and ambition. I want this for ALL white brothers and sisters their families. I see so many disgruntled young whites trapped in the prison of multiculturalism; forcing them to feel stifled and hopeless. A lot of them don't understand why they are frustrated and as a result, they give up and sadly turn to the degenerate lifestyles glamorized by capitalistic lefties. For those who willingly go down with the herd, I have no pity. But for those who struggle and try to make a better life for themselves and their families, I want to offer my story, my resources, my support and mostly my heart. If I were leading a unit here in TN, you could rest assured that I would challenge EVERY white man to reach his MAXIMUM potential physically and intellectually, as well as every white woman to their potential. Our pro-black culture emphasizes laziness and sloth. I will NOT accept that from my fellow white man as so many of them have sadly embraced. I would require mandatory readings, workouts, socialization among other NSM family members, group trips, group writings, day care networks, employer networks and so much more. I have made the decision to contact you in the hopes that you will welcome me into the movement and allow me to demonstrate how I could be an ASSET to OUR cause. Upon your response, I could offer you a life story that may at times shock you. However, everything that has happened in my life has led me to realize that I NEED to do this. I am not a \"common stereotype\" of a racist, skinhead or NAZI. My growing disgust towards the country that I love has made me into a powerful machine; ready to take aim at immorality, illegal immigration, ghetto culture and whites who disgrace themselves and our race. *Cordially,* *Mike Cook* ** ------------------------------ Stay up to date on your PC, the Web, and your mobile phone with Windows Live.

On Apr 27, 2016, at 6:05 PM, Bennett, Eric > wrote: H\/t Brinster Cruz co-chair in Virginia travels to Syria, praises Assad Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign co-chairman in Virginia has traveled to Syria and promised support for the government of President Bashar Assad, who U.S. officials have repeatedly said has lost the legitimacy to rule the war-torn country. Virginia state Sen. Dick Black's trip to a Middle Eastern country in the midst of a civil war and his comments in the face of official U.S. foreign policy are highly unusual for a state lawmaker. Black, an outspoken Republican, is a part-time state senator who has no role in official U.S. foreign policy. Still, he has met with Assad government officials and said he would advocate for better relationships between Assad and the U.S., according to the official Syrian news agency. \"I will be Syria's voice,\" Black said, according to the news agency. Unlike his GOP rivals, Cruz has been less than eager to use military force to take out the Assad government. \"If we are to defeat our enemies we need to be clear-eyed that toppling a government and allowing radical Islamic terrorists to take over a nation is not benefiting our national security interests,\" Cruz said at the Republican Jewish Coalition forum in December, referring to President Barack Obama's Syria policy goals. \"Putting ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of yet another state in the Middle East is not benefiting our national security.\" The Cruz campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Black's trip to Syria. Black was also recently elected to be a Virginia delegate at the Republican National Committee's convention this summer. He is one of the most vocal social conservatives in Virginia's General Assembly, and has drawn national attention for his opposition to abortion and gay rights. The former Vietnam War veteran and military lawyer dismayed Republican leaders in 2003 by sending fellow lawmakers small, plastic likenesses of a fetus to underscore his opposition toward abortion. The state senator raised eyebrows in 2014 when he sent a letter to Assad praising him. It was posted on the Syrian president's Facebook page. Black is expected to meet with Assad during his visit, the Syrian newspaper Al-Watan reported. Syria's conflict began with mostly peaceful protests in 2011, but a brutal government crackdown and the rise of an armed insurgency eventually plunged the country into a full-blown civil war. The fighting has killed more than 250,000 people, according to the United Nations, which stopped tracking casualties several months ago. Black has said Assad protected Christians and fought terrorist groups. On his Twitter account, Black said he supported Assad because he is stemming the growth of the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS. \"If Assad falls, ISIS will secure Syria and march on Europe,\" the tweet said. Last year, Black said the Virginia Capitol Police alerted him to a threat against him by the Islamic State for his support of Assad. The state senator was featured in a magazine published by the Islamic state. Black posted a link on Twitter on Wednesday to article written by an Iranian state-run TV news agency, which quoted Black as saying the Syrian civil war would \"come to an end if the U.S. stops training terrorist in Jordan, Saudi Arabia\" and other countries. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Black \"is entitled to his views, but they do not reflect this administration's policy on Syria.\" Black met with a Lebanese Christian politician allied with the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, which is fighting alongside Assad's forces in Syria, the TV news agency reported. Both the Iranian state-run TV news agency and the official Syrian news agency erroneously referred to Black as a U.S. senator. Word of Black's travels drew mockery from political opponents. \"Doesn't surprise me one bit,\" said Virginia Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw. He added that Black shouldn't be trying to meddle in foreign affairs and said Republicans \"would be raising holy hell if the situation was reversed.\"","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Mr. McIntyre, I gather that your intent is to \"audit\" the findings of our recently-published paper in the International Journal of Climatology (IJoC). You are of course free to do so. I note that both the gridded model and observational datasets used in our IJoC paper are freely available to researchers. You should have no problem in accessing exactly the same model and observational datasets that we employed. You will need to do a little work in order to calculate synthetic Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) temperatures from climate model atmospheric temperature information. This should not pose any difficulties for you. Algorithms for calculating synthetic MSU temperatures have been published by ourselves and others in the peer-reviewed literature. You will also need to calculate spatially-averaged temperature changes from the gridded model and observational data. Again, that should not be too taxing. In summary, you have access to all the raw information that you require in order to determine whether the conclusions reached in our IJoC paper are sound or unsound. I see no reason why I should do your work for you, and provide you with derived quantities (zonal means, synthetic MSU temperatures, etc.) which you can easily compute yourself. I am copying this email to all co-authors of the 2008 Santer et al. IJoC paper, as well as to Professor Glenn McGregor at IJoC. I gather that you have appointed yourself as an independent arbiter of the appropriate use of statistical tools in climate research.

American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now. The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. \"In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,\" said the Journal. \"Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time.\" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United. Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. \"The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,\" said the L.A.

Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration. The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. \"The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees\" while \"European authorities have acted more wisely,\" letting Swissair and Sabena \"go to the wall,\" said the Financial Times.

These are companies that once referred to Linux as a \"bathtub of code\" (Sun) and \"a cancer\" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News. Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year. Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: \"Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon.\" Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- \"a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,\" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: \"Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow.\" Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called \"Solinux.\" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. \"Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,\" Poletti reported.

{"text":"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject: Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90\/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30\/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.

{"text":"WATCH Trump fails to impress foreign-policy experts Politico \/\/ Michael Crowley In his address to an elite, invitation-only Washington foreign policy audience Wednesday, Donald Trump promised that, as president, he would restore a \"coherent\" vision to America's role in the world. But across the ideological spectrum, and even among natural allies, Trump's speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that Trump is up to the job. \"It struck me as a very odd mishmash,\" said Doug Bandow, a foreign policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, who shares many of Trump's beliefs about scaling back America's role abroad. \"He called for a new foreign policy strategy, but you don't really get the sense he gave one.\" Trump's speech was \"lacking in policy prescriptions,\" and its \"strident rhetoric masked a lack of depth,\" said Robert \"Bud\" McFarlane, a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan who attended the speech. Speaking at Washington's Mayflower hotel, Trump mostly repeated familiar themes from his campaign, including promises to cut better trade deals with China, swiftly defeat the Islamic State, rebuild the military and reduce the expense America incurs in upholding international security from Europe to Asia. Trump spoke from a teleprompter and in tones that were subdued by the standards of his raucous rallies. He also unveiled a new theme, saying that the U.S. would \"finally have a coherent foreign policy\" based on narrow self-interest, economic gain and global stability. But Trump offered few specifics about his strategy, focusing on the alleged \"disasters\" created by past presidents and a foreign policy establishment who \"frankly don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing for the New York Times or talking on television.\" Trump said he would surround himself with \"talented experts\" and \"new people\" to help him chart a global strategy. But even though he said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" earlier in the day that \"I'll be naming them today,\" he did not do so. The audience was heavier on celebrity journalists like Bob Woodward and Jake Tapper than on the sort of prominent foreign policy thinkers and former government officials typically present at similar appearances by presidential candidates. Trump has largely been shunned by foreign-policy veterans of past Republican administrations, more than 100 members of whom recently signed an open letter saying they would not join his administration; some have threatened to vote for Hillary Clinton over Trump in November. One notable figure sitting in the front row as Trump repeated his call for better relations with Moscow - \"I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength, is possible. Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end\" Trump said - was Russia's ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak. (Trump \"made some intriguing points, but we need to understand what is meant in the implementation,\" Kislyak told POLITICO after the speech. \"It needs to be started carefully.\") Also in attendance was a Trump foreign policy adviser, Walid Phares, a Lebanese Maronite Christian who applauded vigorously when Trump said the U.S. had \"left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.\" The address was hosted by The National Interest magazine, an intellectual journal not often spotted on Trump's private jet, but which promotes the so-called realist school of foreign policy, which holds that the U.S. should pursue narrowly-defined security interests with little concern for missions like promoting democracy or overthrowing repressive regimes. Some of Trump's speech aligned with realist theory, including his disdain for U.S. interventions in the Arab world and what he called \"the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy.\" Under a Trump presidency, he said, \"no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries.\" But experts called Trump's speech rife with internal tensions. He declared that \"America First\" would be the \"major and overriding\" theme of his presidency moments before hailing America's role in World War II - which was opposed by the isolationist America First movement of the early 1940s. He trashed President Barack Obama for failing to follow through with his threatened September 2013 air strikes in Syria, while also lamenting the chaos that has followed U.S. military interventions in Iraq and Libya. And Trump vowed to mend ties with U.S. allies who are fearful that America is withdrawing from the world, while insisting they pay more for their own security. The speech was \"completely contradictory, in the sense that the first message is that we should make allies pay not just for the cost of having troops in their countries but for the entire defense that the U.S. provides to Europe and Asia, which he estimated at trillions of dollars. And then in the next breath, he said that the U.S. can't be relied on and needs to be a better ally,\" said Thomas Wright, a Brookings Institution fellow who has written extensively on Trump's foreign policy. \"There's just no way to reconcile these two statements. It certainly won't reassure anyone internationally, or anyone within the Republican foreign policy establishment,\" Wright added. But Trump is also trying to broaden his electoral support, and some analysts said that the view of elites matters less than the populist soundbites about U.S. military and economic strength repeating on cable television Wednesday afternoon and evening. Trump's complaint that America's NATO allies are not paying their fair share to support the European security alliance does echo at least one influential foreign policy thinker: Barack Obama, who in his address in Hanover, Germany, this week, scolded Europeans for being \"complacent\" about their own defense. Obama has also complained about \"free riders\" from Europe to the Arab Middle East enjoying the benefits of U.S. protection without spending or risking more themselves. Obama has not however, explicitly threatened \" to let these countries defend themselves,\" as Trump did Wednesday. Not everyone was totally dismissive of the Manhattan mogul's appearance, including Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador and National Interest board member who introduced Trump on Wednesday. \"He offered a coherent framework not totally outside the mainstream American foreign policy debate,\" said Khalilzad, who held several senior foreign policy posts in the George W. Bush administration, including ambassador to Iraq and to Afghanistan. \"Of course,\" he added, \"expectations were low.\" Trump also left the hawkish Republican right deeply unimpressed. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of North Carolina, a former 2016 presidential rival to Trump, issued a series of derisive tweets during the address which he said was full of \"disconnected thought\" and demonstrated a \"lack of understanding of threats we face.\" \"Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave,\" Graham tweeted.

{"text":"Dear Ben, well, thanks for your thanks. I'm not sure that I did all that much, but glad that the small amount is appreciated. It's a shame that the process couldn't have been quicker still, but hopefully the final production stage will pass smoothly. Thanks for the copy of the paper, which I've skim read already -- looks very carefully done and therefore convincing (I'm sure you already heard that from others). I note that you also provide some supporting online material (SOM). Provision of SOM is a relatively new facility for IJoC to offer and it may be suffering from teething problems. A paper of mine (Maraun et al.) that appeared online in IJoC back in February still has its SOM missing! Hopefully this is a one-off omission, but I'll now email Glenn to remind him of this in relation to my paper and also point out that your paper has SOM. I think this is a problem on the publisher's side of things rather than an editorial problem. Because of our absent SOM, we've temporarily posted a copy of the SOM on our personal website. If your SOM was delayed, and if you think that critics might complain if the paper appears without the SOM, you might want to post a copy of the SOM on your own website when the paper appears online. But hopefully there'll be no problem with it! I heard you had a recent trip to Australia for Tom's wedding -- hope that was fun!

My name is Dejuana Thompson , the Deputy Director of Community Engagement at the DNC. Community Engagement works to promote advocacy among various progressive political leaders and activists across the country. We work closely with key leadership of the DNC, state parties, external partners, and allies to ensure seamless integration into the larger DNC strategy and engage, inform, and mobilize specific constituencies. I am proud to welcome the DNC Chair Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Chair of the DNC's Women's Caucus Lottie Shackleford, and Pratt Wiley the National Director of Voter Expansion at the DNC, to this call. I would like to remind everyone that this call is strictly off-the-record, and is closed to the press. With that, it is my pleasure to turn this call over to the DNC Chair Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. DNC Chair Representative Wasserman Schultz Thank you Marilyn. I also want to thank everyone on this call for joining us today. The right to vote is our most fundamental right, and the right by which all of our other rights are secured. No one should ever take for granted their right to vote, nor should anyone seek to take that right away. But the GOP seems to believe their path to victory lies in restricting access to the ballot box, and Republican-led state legislatures are leading the charge in key battleground states across the country. We see that most clearly in North Carolina, where the so-called Voter Information Verification Act, reversed a generation of electoral progress. Passed in the wake a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the bill eliminated same-day voter registration, rolled back early voting by a full week, and imposed new photo ID requirements for voters. This purely partisan law was passed without any support from Democrats because its intent was clear from the very beginning \u2013 to systematically limit access to the polls in order to sway elections. It is deeply disturbing that as our nation moves forward, one of the country's major political parties is attempting to drag us backward. We should not have to re-litigate yesterday's battles or continue a fight we have previously won. Yet this is playing out all across the country. From North Carolina to Wisconsin to Arizona, we've seen a number of states pass anti-voter laws designed to limit access to the polls. Whether it's implementing restrictive photo ID laws, rolling back early voting, eliminating same-day registration, or changing polling locations without notifying voters, these types of tactics make it harder to vote. When we limit the ways that people can vote, we are hurting the low-wage workers with two jobs, the recently married woman who hasn't changed her name on her driver's license, the single mother who goes to work early each morning and picks up her children late at night, and the widower without a car who relies on his grown children to get to the polls. And as you may have noticed, these types of laws disproportionately impact women, minorities, students, the elderly, and low-income people. We're going to discuss how these laws hurt women voters in particular. And by the way \u2013 we've outnumbered male voters in every national election since 1964. In 2012, approximately 10 million more women voted than men, contributing to the largest gender gap in history. President Barack Obama won 56 percent of the women's vote in the last election and women voters made the difference in several high-profile races, helping Democrats retain control of the Senate that year. So it's easy to see why the GOP is taking aim at women voters \u2013 we're a key part of the Democratic constituency and we vote in large numbers. Women face a number of \"silent\" obstacles on Election Day that I alluded to earlier. Rolling back or restricting early voting hurts makes voting more difficult for those with limited flexibility in their schedules. Women have comprised 60 percent of early voters in 2012. Women are more likely than men to change their name due to marriage or divorce. However, some voter ID laws require voters' government issued identification to exactly match their name at their local polling place. So if you haven't had time to go to the DMV for a new license, then you're penalized at the polls. And some states now require documented proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, just to register to vote. If citizens don't provide sufficient evidence, then they are not allowed to vote in state and local elections. It is estimated that 32 million eligible women voters may lack proof of citizenship that matches their current legal name. I cannot emphasize this enough \u2013 women are an important voting block that the Republican Party has largely alienated. We cannot allow them to continue to silence our voices. With that, I would like to turn the call over to my dear friend, the Chair of the DNC's Women's Caucus, Lottie Shackleford. Women's Caucus Chair Lottie Shackelford Thank you Debbie. I started my career in politics back in 1978, and I have witnessed many \"firsts.\" I was also the first women elected Mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas, and I have tried to open the doors of opportunity for other women. Women must \u2013 we can and we must \u2013 amplify our voices and values at the ballot box. To echo Debbie, women have outnumbered male voters in every national election since 1964. Our voices are powerful when we go to the polls. Let me take a moment to talk about this year's race. Donald Trump is dangerous, and he lacks the judgment and the temperament to be president. I wouldn't want him to take a tour of the White House, let alone live there. He has a long history of denigrating women, and the vile, sexist comments he's made on the campaign trail are beneath the dignity of the office he seeks. Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare choices. He has said that women who had abortions should be punished \u2013 but not the doctors that performed them. He's even opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion. Trump said that ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to \"the marketplace,\" and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back. He's also called pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business.\" Trump even complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him \"100 percent.\" This is about our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, and ourselves. That's who he's referring to. He's talking about us. And we must hold him accountable. Our vote is our voice. Let's use it this fall. And let's register and encourage others to vote. Here's what I am asking you to do: Know the Law. In order to successfully vote, you need to know the rules of the road. Make sure you check with your local board of elections. Engage Your Community. Women are most likely to register to vote if someone they know and trust asks them to vote and engages them in a discussion about the issues. Keep in touch with the people you registered through email, events, town hall meetings, candidate forums, et cetera. Invite them to attend registration or other events that will engage them more deeply in the political process. Register to vote, plan to vote, and then vote. Ensure you ask the three most important questions: 1) Are they registered to vote 2) Have they voted? 3) What is their plan on or before Election Day to vote? There's too much at stake this election. We can't look back, and ask ourselves what more could we have done. We need to go out there and do it! I would now like to turn this call over to Pratt Wiley, the DNC's National Director of Voter Expansion. Pratt Wiley, National Director of Voter Expansion Democrats believe that we solve our nation's problems with more democracy, not less. The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our commitment to ensuring every eligible citizen is able to register, every registered voter is able to vote, and every vote is accurately counted. But the opposite seems to be true for the Republican Party. Republicans have been following the same playbook \u2013 in North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida and beyond \u2013 to tilt elections in their favor. Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country are passing restrictive voting laws that make it harder for women, minorities, and students to vote. These groups are not only the Democrat's core constituency \u2013 they are also the majority of Americans. Voter impersonation \u2013 the type of conduct that photo IDs are supposed to eliminate \u2013 is virtually non-existent. A comprehensive study found only 31 instances of voter impersonation in over 1 billion votes casts \u2013 that's twice as rare as a shark attack. These facts, however, are not stopping the GOP from seeking a solution to a problem that just doesn't exist. Former Senator Jim DeMint, who now leads the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation, recently admitted that voter ID laws help elect \"more conservative candidates.\" In April, students at the Marquette University polling station faced two hour wait times to vote. Many still stood in line well after the polls official closed and the race was called. At the same time, a Republican Wisconsin Congressman bragged to reporters that the state's restrictive photo ID law would help the GOP defeat Democrats in the fall. In Texas, Senator Ted Cruz filed an amicus brief in support of Texas' restrictive photo ID law. Cruz wears his opposition to voting rights as a badge of honor. In 2012, he voiced his opposition to a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also led the fight as Texas Solicitor General to limit voter registration efforts in communities of color, vigorously defending a discriminatory law against a civil rights lawsuit. And we all remember just four years ago when the Pennsylvania Republican House Leader announced that the state's restrictive photo ID law was 'gonna allow Governor Romney to win the State of Pennsylvania.' It's not hard to see that this is a part of a cynical political ploy to boast the Republican's electoral success this fall. While Democrats have gone to court in Arizona to reverse the culture of discrimination and disenfranchisement, Republicans are going to court to defend laws designed to decrease voter turnout \u2013 because that is their only path to victory. As mentioned by our distinguished speakers, the DNC and Democrats across the nation will not waver in defending the right to vote \u2013 the most fundamental of all of our rights. Again, I want to thank everyone for joining us and I would now like to open the call to questions.

{"text":"According to the papers, an important bill to protect parental rights is dead. Well, maybe it's not so dead. We definitely have to keep the story alive and get the message to the people. I need lots of letters to the Miami Herald with basically these messages: -School children are being prescribed psychiatric drugs in alarming numbers without their parents being warned of the risks and alternatives. -The issue of informed consent for parents is supported by MANY people and groups. -Even the FDA is warning that these drugs can cause psychosis, suicide and death. -There are vested interests opposing House Bill 1213. -The pharmaceutical industry makes more money than the oil industry. -Parents have a right to know the risks and alternatives before they put their children in harm's way. And if your last name ends in C, K, or T, I want you to point out this absurdity: -The opposition to the bill isn't claiming that there is anything untrue about the required parental consent, only that requiring the consent would prevent people from seeking treatment. So what they're saying is that if you tell people the truth, they'll avoid psychiatry's dangerous and unworkable treatments.

Best, Doyle ________________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Posted on Wed, Mar. 29, 2006 BEHAVIORAL DRUGS Religious bias may have spurred demise of child medicating bill Lawmakers killed a bill that would have told parents about the risks of mental-health drugs for kids, amid concerns of a Scientology influence. BY MARC CAPUTO mcaputo@MiamiHerald.com TALLAHASSEE - An effort to warn parents of the dangers of mental-health drugs on children was defeated unexpectedly Tuesday by lawmakers, feeding speculation that it was killed in part because of its link to the Church of Scientology, which opposes the use of the drugs. The bill was touted last month by prominent Scientologists and actresses Kelly Preston and Kirstie Alley. It would have required parents to read and sign a long and ominous-sounding statement detailing the dangers of the drugs once their children are referred in public school for evaluations of learning disabilities or emotional, behavioral or mental disorders. PASSED LAST YEAR A similar measure passed the full Legislature last year, but was vetoed by Gov. Jeb Bush, who thought the bill went too far. Miami Beach Republican Rep. Gus Barreiro, a kids' rights crusader worried about the ''epidemic'' of over-drugging, drafted the new legislation to quell the governor's concerns and give parents the right to know the risks of drugs such as Ritalin and Strattera. ''This is bigger than tobacco,'' Barreiro said, citing a state report showing a 425 percent increase over the past five years in diagnoses of attention-deficit disorder. ''What's happening to our kids and what we're doing to our kids, it's really, truly inexcusable.'' BILL OVERLY BIASED But on a 6-4 vote, the House Health Care Regulation Committee heeded the warnings of mental-health specialists and killed the legislation, saying it would have presented parents an overly biased view against mental-health treatments, thereby erecting barriers to treatment. ''It's misleading,'' said Rep. Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat. To illustrate her point, she read off the side-effects of one popular medication that sounded dangerous before noting its name: Penicillin. Sobel, like the others who voted against the bill, said she opposed it because of its contents, not its supporters -- the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a Scientology-funded organization dedicated to ''investigating and exposing psychiatric human rights abuse.'' The Clearwater-based executive director of the commission's Florida chapter, Helyn Dunn, said it will continue to push the legislation in the Senate and build on what it says is a coalition of nearly 30 groups worried about drugging kids. Concerns about Scientology have ''been a problem all along,'' Dunn said. ''But this isn't about Scientology or Scientologists. The overdrugging of children should concern everybody.'' The disclosure letter the legislation called for would have furthered the commission's battle against psychiatrists by telling parents that the diagnosis of mental disorders such as depression and attention-deficit disorder are ''based on . . . observation and subjective interpretation.'' SCIENTOLOGIST SUPPORT The commission's lobbyist, Bob Reynolds, said that ''a number'' of lawmakers -- he wouldn't say who -- inquired about the Scientology angle. 'It was said with some frequency: 'This is who you represent.' And that's sad. This is a participatory democracy,'' Reynolds said. Barreiro said he, too, was aware of some colleagues' discomfort with Scientology and said it ''could have played a role'' in the defeat of the legislation. He and Reynolds said the opposition by mental-health professionals played a big part as well. Among the opponents was Wayne K. Goodman, a University of Florida psychiatry professor and chair of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's psycho-pharmacology advisory panel. Goodman said the letter to parents could have been a ''barrier'' to treatment because it stressed the ''black box'' warnings about mental health drugs, but did nothing to inform parents of their effectiveness. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of producint the expert stories for our simulation. I understand you will be obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories. Thank you for your help. Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind: Number of SMEs needed: 10 Number of expert stories: 20-25 Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a mix of structurers, originators and traders I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories. The main difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11\/28, instead of 11\/30. By 11\/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday. (11\/26-11\/28) --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs (11\/28-11\/30) --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer. Kidsave's Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older child. In 1999 and 2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program. The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or family-like environments. We are looking for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp program happen for these 250 children. As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the money to bring these children here and find them families. Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948 or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's Kidsave program. Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

{"text":"Dear Peck et al Thanks for clearing this up. The bottom line is that the version of this paper on the UCAR site is fine. Unfortunately though, the one we have on the IPCC WG1 web site is not! I am attaching a copy of that for clarity. The metadata in this PDF file indicate that it was created by Oyvind Paasche from a Word document in early March when we were asking the chapter teams to provide copies of the unpublished literature. It seems that Oyvind worked from an earlier and significantly shorter version - less text, fewer tables and the figures are different - as you can see in the attached. Although to repeat my earlier statement the conclusions of this earlier draft do not appear to me to be substantially different. Based on what we now know, the TSU should add the NCAR version of the paper to our review web site and we will do that today. Thanks Martin At 07:58 AM 5\/22\/2006, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: Thanks all who have commented. Below is the likely final word unless Martin needs more clarification. Seem ok, Martin? Sorry for the confusion. Guess some reviewers are running out of substantive issues, so that might be a sign that we're getting close to the final draft... Best, Peck From Caspar: Dear all, yes the UCAR version can be considered the \"official\" one. I changed the order of pages because I needed to separate the \"primary content\" of the paper from its \"supplement\"; thus I moved tables xS, figure 1S and its caption to the end. Everything else is identical. From Keith: \"the differences are as I understand , insubstantial and not pertinent to the interpretation used in preparing the draft.\" and Gene: Wahl, Eugene R wrote: Hello Peck, Martin, Bette, Eystein, Caspar: I just double checked the UCAR website version with the pdf version I have, and they are identical with the exception that the supplemental tables (Tables 1S and 2S), and supplemental figure caption and figure (Figure 1S) are placed at the very end of the document in the UCAR version. The content is identical in both versions. The text (including tables and figure captions) of the UCAR pdf is also identical to the WORD text that I sent to Peck, Keith Briffa, and Eyestein Jansen on February 24. There was a version sent on February 21, which the February 24 version superceded. There were 3 words changed on p. 17, and some changes made to Appendix 1 in the February 24 version. Perhaps this difference between the 2\/21 and 2\/24 versions is the cause of the differences that Martin has seen. [Note: I would have sent the graphics separately with these versions, and I did not keep copies of the sent files in my email account -- to deal with memory limits in the system here. Thus, I cannot confirm exactly which graphic files are associated with the February 24 version. My apologies.] In summary, the UCAR website pdf document should be considered the official one that is \"accepted\/in press\". Formal notification of acceptance from Stephen Schneider at Climatic Change came on February 28. The article is still in this status. Let me know if I can help clarify things futher. Please note that I will be in Boulder starting May 27, to be a visiting scholar at NCAR for a month. I will be keeping up with email from there. Peace, Gene Dr. Eugene R. Wahl Asst.

I'll cc to Caspar and Gene to see if they can clarify the situation and make sure we have the correct version. I'll also cc Bette since she may see Caspar around NCAR and make sure he know's we are trying to clarify things with his paper. More soon, thx, Peck Dear Eystein and Jonathan It has been pointed out to us by a reviewer that the version of the Wahl and Amman paper (accepted by Climatic Change) on our review web site differs from the version that is available publicly from the NCAR web site at: [ [2] pdf ] Although the differences are not (in my view) substantial, the paper on the NCAR web site is apparently dated Feb 24th (i.e. before the date of final submission of the SOD), it has additional figures and data, and the running header says \"Feb 24, .... in press\". Could you please clarify which of the two versions of this paper would reflect most accurately the status of the paper as used by the Chapter 6 team when preparing the SOD. That has been our basis for deciding on which version to include on our reviewer web pages up until now, but we are now reconsidering whether to also include updated versions of unpublished papers as well.

Good for research. Thanks! From: Walker, Eric Sent: Sunday, May 22, 2016 10:18 AM To: Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Freundlich, Christina; Walsh, Tom Subject: Draft hit from this morning: GOP Chairman says Trump's Muslim ban helps ISIS recruit terrorists SL: GOP Chairman confirms Trump's Muslim ban helps ISIS recruit terrorists Today, GOP Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul confirmed that Trump's despicable and divisive plan to ban Muslims from the United States would cause a 'backlash' and could help ISIS recruit terrorists. Watch: Chairman McCaul is correct that Trump is helping ISIS recruit terrorists. Just two days ago, Politifact confirmed that ISIS and other terror groups are using clips of Donald Trump in recruiting videos. \"There are many titles you can affix to Donald Trump \u2013 sexist, racist, xenophobic, dangerous, liar, etc. \u2013 but Republican Chairman McCaul may have come up with a new one: ISIS recruiter. Banning an entire religion from the country not only runs counter to the constitution and our values \u2013 it also makes America less safe by straining relations with Muslim communities and helping terrorists recruit, a view confirmed by Republican leaders. The fact that terror groups are using Donald Trump's words to help recruit more terrorists is just the latest reason why Trump is totally and categorically unfit to be President.\" \u2013 Eric Walker, DNC Spokesperson Eric Walker walkere@dnc.org 732-991-1489 @ericmwalker","label":0}

{"text":"Dear all IMPRINT colleagues, Being away from Europe, this was a very bad news that I got this morning listening about the rejection of IMPRINT. Eystein did a great job by being able to gather the European paleo community under a common umbrella and he desereves a lot of our consideration. Concerning now the review process, I have been involved several times in Brussels and I have been able to see the evolution of the evaluating panel session after session. I am not please with this evaluation and I already addressed my comments to Andre Berger. It is not normal that entering the room where you are supposed to meet the other \"panelists\" you would not know those who are supposed to be representative of your community, this is my first comment. Second, the way the referees are selected is somehow strange and involve a political issue which is very sensitive as I'm sure you will understand that a country fair representation is not enough in our field which better involves expertise. Third and last, having set a consortium of the leading Europe institutions and scientists, how can you expect appropriate expertise? I have been approached to join the evaluating panel but refused as being an IMPRINT member to respect some ethic. If, what I wish, we all didi that way, they one can sincerely expect the worst as I already experienced in a recent past. Forth, complaining to the commission is a waste of time as these administrative people, even if this is you right, will always provide you with arguments to justify the decision. I complain once to the director of the programme who just retun me that the referees of my proposal were relevant, what I know was not the case unfortunately. However I totally support the initiative to question the commission on the way the evaluations are performed, but also how the referees are selected. Fifth, you all are waiting for the reviews. I agree with Rainer that the comments that are provided are useless and in somehow offending the PIs. This is mostly due to the review process and this again must be changed. Furthermore what we receive is the consensus report which passed in the European officers hands to be cleaned of any agressive sentences or words, and must remain politically correct. So effectively these reports are useless. It would be interesting to get also the individual reports on which the consensus one has been established and would better show the real work of every referee, and we would be very surprised sometimes. Finaly to follow Thomas, Rainer and Eric, I would suggest to continue what has been launched with IMPRINT which is to my sense unique in gathering all the European paleo community under the same umbrella. May be the proposal was too broad, but this was following the commission's aim. The \"Millenium\" proposal benefited of several consecutive EU supports which apparently helped a lot. Their lobbying seem to have ben very efficient, not only in Brussels but in the journals and meetings. The Utrecht initiative was a good one which must stop today. We have the opportunity to gather regularly at least once during the EGU that we all are attending, why not using such opportunity to reinforce the initiative during such meeting? All the very best to all of you cheers denis -------- Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht -------- Betreff: RE: commission performance alpha 5 Von: \"Polychronis Tzedakis\" Datum: Mit, 11.05.2005, 17:25 An: \"Rainer Zahn\" , \"Thomas Stocker\" , \"Atte Korhola\" Dear all, First of all a big hand for Eystein and all those who put in so much time into this task. Very disheartening to hear the outcome. I have muych sympathy with what Rainer Zahn has said, especially on the Brussels front and the client relationships that are cultivated with EU officials. I think that in addition to a letter to the EU, I would suggest that perhaps an editorial in NAture or something similar, outlining the growing degree of scepticism amongst scientists regarding the transparency of the EU funding process might be in order. Chronis Tzedakis -----Original Message----- From: Rainer Zahn Sent: Wed 5\/11\/2005 2:47 PM To: Thomas Stocker; Atte Korhola Cc: Eystein.Jansen@geo.uib.no; Imprint-partner@bjerknes.uib.no; beatriz.balino@bjerknes.uib.no; atle.nesje@geo.uib.no; oyvind.lie@geo.uib.no; john.birks@bio.uib.no; Carin.Andersson@bjerknes.uib.no; trond.dokken@bjerknes.uib.no; ulysses.ninnemann@geo.uib.no; Astrid.Bardgard@fa.uib.no; richard.telford@bjerknes.uib.no Subject: commission performance alpha 5 dear Eystein, dear Imprint consortium, I am sure I will not make many friends with what follows below. Firstly, it surely is sad and disheartening to see our proposal going down. and there are many issues involved some of which have been named in the recent emails. But then there are those issues left that have not been named but which I consider relevant if we are to make progress on the EU FWP front. Some of these issues may and will touch a personal nerve here and there, but let's face some of the unpleasant realities much rather than sitting back and keeping going with business as usual, a business that soon may go out of existence. First, I am not convinced that Imprint was the best we could have done. On my side I was surprised to no small extent during our London meeting to see that those from the modeling community and other groups present obviously had no idea why our palaeo-component (a derivative of the planned ICON IP) was part of Imprint, and they were not overly favourable to listen and expand their views. So in a sense, even within our own consortium there was, perhaps still is a lack of insight and understanding as to what a palaeo-component is about and will have to offer. In the end I am now left with the impression that ICON would have stood a good chance to survive on its own. Second, as a member of the Imprint consortium I still find it difficult today to sort through this proposal and its various components, tasks, topics, milestones, deliverables etc. Which only tells me how ever so more difficult it must have been for outsiders i.e., reviewers to sift through the bits and pieces and comprehend what this is about. But I also feel that this has to do with the concept of IPs at large as it is not an easy task to compose an IP consortium of the dimension and wide range of expertise envisioned by the commission. The outcome of the whole process in my view confirms the notion that the concept of IPs has fundamentally (and to a large degree predictably) failed. This concept reflects a substantial lack of insight on the side of those who were, presumably still are involved in designing research policies in the commission about what science is about and how it works. Those parties should not be where they are, and they certainly should not be involved in setting up FWP7 This is what I have to say about our proposal. As for the Commission's performance it is not my impression they are living up to their own standards that they have set up for the quality of proposals requested. In particular the proposal evaluation process is ridiculous and lacks any degree of substance. For instance, the reviews that I did receive in response to my RTN proposal (submitted last year) are mediocre at best, meaningless and useless in detail, beyond anything I would consider expert insight, simply a waste of time and tax payers' money. They are an insult to anybody who did contribute to and put work and effort into that proposal. As for the Impront proposal we now are faced with the prospect that the only IP proposal, Millennium, that is competing with Imprint from the outset was received more favourably than our own proposal. With this I could live were it not for the fact that in Millennium everything is named as a strategy and work plan that we were being advised to not do. This speaks a language of its own and to me reflects a fundamental lack of enthusiasm, professionalism and competence with those who give advice and organize the evaluation process. Obviously, the vision set out by our programme manager(s) never made it to the reviewers who seemed to follow quite different guidelines, if any. Lastly, from what I can see around me, particularly in the Mediterranean club, it appears more important and beneficial to spend time in Brussels wiping door handles and leaving a professorial - directorial impression rather than composing upbeat cutting edge science proposals. It is ever so disheartening that within the FWP our success seems to depend more on who we know than the quality we present. Last time when programme managerial posts in the commission were reshuffled the primary concern around here was that \"we now lose our contacts\". This is wrong, a disgrace to our community. I have had a few conversations with colleagues who were partners in EU proposals, both successful ones and ones that were rejected. From these conversations I sense a growing degree of tiredness about EU science policy and more so, about the chaotic way proposals are being solicited and then turned down on grounds that so very obviously have nothing to do with the science presented. There is also the notion that within the commission climate and paleo-work has fallen from grace, for reasons not known to many. Which brings me back to the point that perhaps we do not have the right programme managers in place to fend our cause. I am prepared to write a firm letter to the commission, or to contribute to such letter, about the issues impinging on the poor performance of the commision. I rather do that before turning entirely into a full-grown Eurosceptic.

{"text":"EXCLUSIVE: Evangelical leaders to quiz Trump on faith and values Donald Trump has agreed to meet privately with some of the nation's most prominent Evangelical leaders \u2013 a meeting seen as critical to garnering support from social conservatives, Fox News has learned. ADVERTISEMENT \"Our goal is to be able to have a conversation that could lead to a better understanding of what Donald Trump has to offer to the country,\" said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. Click here to join Todd's American Dispatch: A must-read for conservatives! Perkins is one of the key conservative leaders spearheading the gathering \u2013 set for June 21 in New York City. Perkins, along with Bill Dallas of United in Purpose, worked with Dr. Ben Carson to arrange the meeting. As many as 500 conservative leaders from around the nation are expected to attend the invitation-only event. The meeting was convened by a who's who among Evangelicals \u2013 including Southern Baptist Convention President Ronnie Floyd, James Dobson, Ralph Reed, Penny Nance, Bob McEwen, Tim Wildmon of the American Family Association, Kelly Shackleford of First Liberty, and mega-church pastors Jack Graham and Ed Young. \"I want to be actively supportive of a candidate who can help turn this nation around,\" Perkins told me. \"With Trump \u2013 I'm not there yet. I hope to be there \u2013 but I'm not there right now.\" PODCAST: Listen to a new episode of the Todd Starnes podcast click here. Perkins said Trump will not be delivering a speech. He will be there to answer questions. There will be no straw poll. There will be no endorsement from the conservative leaders. \"There is no preconceived outcome here,\" he told me. \"I'm hoping we can have a conversation that could lead to helping conservative leaders make a decision about what to do in this election.\" The meeting comes as a small, but vocal number of Christian leaders is urging people of faith to stay at home on Election Day. And that's why Tony Perkins is worried. \"Our goal is to be able to have a conversation that could lead to a better understanding of what Trump has to offer to the country,\" he said. \"If we don't try, the outcome is not going to be good.\" Specifically, the leaders want to hear detailed plans on potential Supreme Court nominees and the vetting process. They also want to hear about Trump's policies regarding religious liberty, pro-life issues and possible vice presidential candidates. \"A vice presidential pick is going to be very crucial,\" Perkins said. \"Mr. Trump doesn't have a track record \u2013 so I am going to rely very heavily on who he is going to pick as a running mate.\" Floyd, the president of the nation's largest Protestant denomination, said he just wants to do the right thing. \"The vast majority of Southern Baptists are very much where I am today \u2013 we're trying to figure this out,\" he told me. \"We're trying to navigate through these waters that are very uncertain and very difficult.\" Floyd had strong words for Christian leaders who are suggesting voters should simply stay home. \"We cannot change what exists or even alter it or adjust it sitting on the sidelines and prognosticating about the situation,\" he said. \"We have a biblical responsibility, but we also have a responsibility as citizens of the United States to express the privileges afforded to us \u2013 that men and women have died on the battlefield to give us \u2013 and I'm not walking away from that.\" Floyd said the conversation with Trump is a way for Christians to share their hearts with him. \"None of us have endorsed Mr. Trump, nor have we condemned Mr. Trump,\" he said. \"This is about the possibility of being able to appoint the next four Supreme Court justices. This is about the dignity of human life from the womb to the tomb. This is about religious freedom. I'm not about to sit at home and not express something. I'm accountable to God and I believe I'm accountable to my fellow Americans.\" But at the same time, he acknowledged that many people of faith are struggling to come to terms with some of Mr. Trump's past statements \u2013 statements that are contrary to biblical teachings. \"Could you vote for him? That's the question at hand,\" Floyd said. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

{"text":"Gavin Newsom, Lt. Governor of California Amy, A writer named David Kettle once described government like a vending machine. You have limited choices, the outcomes aren't always great, and sometimes your candy bar gets stuck in the machine, but if you aren't happy there really isn't much you can do. We've all been there, but we can do better. First off, government must do more to use the technology at its disposal to connect with citizens. That means creating more opportunities for people to interface with government online and getting better about using social media to create an open dialogue with citizens. It also means pitting government agencies against one another with hard metrics and \"Yelp\" style applications to keep everyone from the DMV to the VA accountable and in close competition for the best in customer service. And that's just the beginning. Sure, we can put more forms online and make it easier to leave comments with a local agency. That's easy, and in many places it's already happening. But if we're really going to demand transparency and openness and change the way government works, then it needs to be more than just a vending machine where you put in your dollar, make a decision and walk away. It needs to be a collaborative, two-way conversation. That starts with you. It's petitions, it's calling your elected officials, it's making noise when something's broken and, even better, pointing out something that works and saying 'hey, we need more of that!' Here in California, I worked with UC Berkeley to create an online \"California Report Card\" where citizens can grade the state's work on important issues and suggest other areas that demand our attention. It's a start, and government has to get more engaged and offer more tools for civic engagement. But it's your voice that will make the difference. So get out there! Make some calls, flip your laptop open and fire up those iPhones. We need to hear from you. Gavin Paid for by Newsom for California \u2013 Lieutenant Governor 2014. FPPC ID# 1333762.

Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure alternative to Exchange.) What's different this time?

{"text":"That's it? The American people have waited more than 2,200 days \u2013 and endured 63 House GOP votes to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to see the Republican fantasy plan to replace the ACA. And even though Republicans have admitted that they're never going to actually produce a replacement bill, Speaker Ryan finally teased out the big idea that the GOP spent six years thinking up: \"An Old Idea That Doesn't Work,\" according to The Huffington Post . Paul Ryan's Big Plan To Replace Obamacare Is An Old Idea That Doesn't Work It took him six years to come up with a policy invented in the 1970s. If you were hoping Republicans had fresh new solutions for health care reform up their sleeves, you might find the recent hints from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a bit disappointing. After six years of the GOP failing to come up with a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act, what Ryan outlined during an appearance at Georgetown University on Wednesday was essentially another stab at a decades-old idea that's never really worked \u2014 an idea that would involve allowing health insurance companies to resume charging sick people higher rates than healthy people. The cornerstone of Ryan's approach is so-called high-risk pools, a form of health insurance designed for people with the most serious health conditions and highest costs, who were mostly locked out of the regular private market before the Affordable Care Act required insurers to accept all applicants. If the concept sounds familiar, it's because high-risk pools have existed since 1976, and are a go-to policy proposal for Republicans who don't want to be accused of not caring about people with pre-existing conditions\u2026The problem is, high-risk pools \u2014 which existed in 35 states before the Affordable Care Act made them virtually obsolete \u2014 always failed to achieve their goal of providing a true insurer of last resort to those who needed it\u2026 \u2026This was part of Ryan's argument to the college-aged audience that letting insurance companies once again discriminate against the sick, and moving the most ailing into a separate program, would be good for them. Young people would pay lower health insurance premiums if older, sicker people were in a separate program, he said. But that doesn't account for the cost to taxpayers of whatever government subsidies would be provided to people in the high-risk pools\u2026 Earlier in his appearance at Georgetown, Ryan repeated his promise that Republicans would finally tell Americans how they would do health care reform differently\u2026Ryan didn't offer a lot of fine detail in his four-minute reply to the student's question. Republicans will supposedly unveil a health care plan this summer, and maybe it will address the shortcomings apparent in what Ryan did say this week. For now, though, his plan sounds like it won't be as good for people with pre-existing conditions as what they already have under Obamacare. Old ideas that don't work: That's all we've seen from Speaker Ryan during his \"Year of Ideas.\" Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, a milestone 20 million previously uninsured Americans now have quality, affordable health insurance. Here's a new idea for Speaker Ryan and House Republicans: wake up to the truth of the ACA's success, and join with Democrats to build on the monumental progress we've made toward a healthier, stronger America.","label":0}

Great explainer, including how trump's language is dog whistling From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 12:29 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Vox: trumps's trans position is incoherent Donald Trump's position on transgender rights is incoherent, not \"nuanced\" The Washington Post picked an interesting word to describe Donald Trump's new position on legal protections for transgender people: \"nuanced.\" A better word, however, might be \"incoherent.\" Trans people are \"a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the population,\" Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be left to the states, most of which he said would \"make the right decisions.\" So he would rescind the Obama administration's guidelines telling federally funded schools to respect the rights of trans people, including their right to use a bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. In other words, Trump thinks trans people should be protected by the law, but he wants to take away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in public schools. Pressed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old mantra of \"states' rights.\" As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sense if there's something local and state governments can do better than the federal government, or if it would be too burdensome or unwieldy for the federal government to get involved. A good example of that: fire departments. There's really no reason to think a federal fire department would be particularly more effective in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some exceptions may apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income areas.) Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history and current experience make that very clear. States have and still are failing at prohibiting discrimination We have seen how this plays out already - in the 1960s, when the federal government had to step in to force schools to stop discriminating against black people. It's one of the big reasons the Civil Rights Act passed in the first place. Similarly, the federal government passed Title IX in the 1970s after it became clear that states were failing to ensure equal opportunities for women in schools. Now the country is seeing the same kind of failure with trans people. For one, most states do not have explicit anti-discrimination protections for trans people in the workplace, housing, education, or public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public). So it's not explicitly illegal under most states' laws to fire, evict, or refuse service to someone entirely because she's trans. In fact, some states are actively discriminating against trans people. That's what North Carolina did when it passed a law that banned local nondiscrimination ordinances that include sexual orientation and gender identity, and banned trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. Some people might wonder why denying trans people access to the bathroom for their gender identity is discrimination. It's simple: Forcing trans people to use the bathroom that doesn't align with their gender identity acts as a reminder that, as far as society has come on some LGBTQ issues, it's still not completely willing to accept trans people and their identities - even if trans people pose no danger to anyone else . So to trans people, this is just another slight by society. And it's a slight most states allow - and that North Carolina explicitly embraced. This is why the Obama administration got involved. If the country believes that anti-LGBTQ discrimination should be illegal (and majorities do in every state ), but states aren't stopping that discrimination from happening, it makes sense for the federal government - which has historically done this when states fail - to intervene, especially in schools the federal government funds. That's exactly what happened. Trump's position sounds more like a dodge [Donald Trump in West Virginia.]Mark Lyons\/Getty ImagesDonald Trump in West Virginia. Given this history and Trump's position, it's odd that Trump would say this issue should be left to the states. It does, however, make sense if you see it as a dodge. After all, \"states' rights\" has long been the mantra of national-level politicians who want to stay out of touchy issues when they know where the country or their party is going. For example, Hillary Clinton said in 2006 that same-sex marriage should be left up to the states . And John McCain said the same of same-sex marriage in 2008. Trump seems to be in a similar position. He says he wants to protect trans people. But he probably realizes that some members of the Republican Party, particularly religious conservatives, wouldn't appreciate that position. So \"states' rights\" it is. TJ Helmstetter Deputy Director of Regional and Specialty Media Democratic National Committee 202.863.8022 - desk 973.464.9224 - cell HelmstetterT@DNC.org","label":0}

{"text":"In advance of Donald Trump's foreign policy speech tomorrow, Huffington Post published a piece titled, Trump at War , which explains how the military is bracing itself for the dangerous possibility of a Trump victory in November. Trump in the White House would leave our country saddled with a Commander-in-Chief that does not have the temperament and experience to oversee our nation's military, national security and defense operations. Below are excerpts. Trump at War By Andy Kroll \u2026 Meanwhile, when Trump has weighed in on national security questions, his remarks often reveal either ignorance or disdain for military expertise and the codes of conduct that govern the armed forces. \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me,\" he boasted in one speech, adding, \"I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war.\" His foreign policy prescriptions include proposals to \"bomb the shit out of ISIS,\" to \"take out\" the families of ISIS members and to torture terrorism suspects. (\"Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would,\" he told one crowd. \"And you know what? If it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway, for what they're doing.\") When it was pointed out that soldiers couldn't legally carry out those last two actions, Trump was unconcerned. \"They're not going to refuse me. Believe me.\" (He walked back that last statement the next day.) The Geneva Conventions, he recently observed, have made American soldiers \"afraid to fight.\" Trump's pronouncements on foreign policy, combined with his years of broadsides, have set off a very real fear within military circles about what might happen were he to become president. In the last two months, I spoke with dozens of people in the national security realm\u2014current and retired officers, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and former White House, State Department, Pentagon and CIA officials. The words they used to describe their mood: Terrified. Shocked. Appalled. Never before, they say, has a candidate gotten so close to the White House with such little respect for the military. \"He completely misunderstands the military profession that he would head if he were the president,\" said Robert Killebrew, a retired colonel who served in the Army for more than 30 years. Others were less polite. In a pair of ads produced by the American Future Fund, a retired Special Forces commander named Michael Waltz calls Trump a draft-dodger who \"hasn't served this country a day in his life,\" and a Vietnam veteran, Tom Hanton, says that Trump's quip about POWs was \"the most infuriating comment I think I've heard from a politician in my entire life.\" One former Marine infantry officer described Trump to me as a \"fake-bake-ing chicken hawk\" whose \"knowledge of the Middle East could be trumped (sorry) by your average Georgetown sophomore.\" Trump's chosen foreign policy advisers\u2014which include a 2009 college graduate who touted his experience in the Model U.N. on his online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and another who used Kanye West lyrics to make arguments on his foreign policy blog\u2014have only stoked these anxieties. \"Weirdo nobodies,\" was how one military historian characterized them to me. \"They're probably the least qualified group of foreign policy and national security advisers I've ever seen or even heard of,\" said Richard Kohn, an expert in civil-military relations and retired professor at the University of North Carolina. \u2026 For even the savviest of presidents, the relationship between a commander in chief and his military is famously fraught, an intricate dance of egos and agendas, worldviews and bureaucracies. A President Trump, however, could usher in a clash of historic proportions. \"If you take the man at his word,\" said Michael Breen, the president of the Truman National Security Project and a decorated former Army officer, \"we have a presidential candidate who seems to have committed himself to triggering what would probably be the greatest crisis in civil-military relations since the American Civil War.\" \u2026 The current Joint Chiefs chairman, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, is known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and military worlds, with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama. And in recent months, Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of Trump's statements. When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about Trump's support for torture and attacking the families of suspected terrorists, Dunford didn't mention Trump by name, but observed that such orders would have an \"adverse effect\" on \"the morale of the force\" and \"aren't legal for them to do anyway.\" \u2026 The nation's intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxieties about the prospect of a Trump presidency. CIA Director John Brennan recently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future president to use waterboarding. John Rizzo, the former CIA general counsel who worked at the agency for 35 years, told me that the employees he still spoke with were \"terrified\" at the prospect of reopening the debates over the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. \"Deep concern is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chief basically ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma,\" he said. If Trump won and followed through on his proposals, Rizzo predicted an employee \"exodus.\" \"At a minimum,\" he went on, \"people would refuse to participate in anything resembling the former interrogation program and insist on a transfer to another part of the agency where they wouldn't be involved in these things.\" Read the entire article here .

The point would seem to be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more partners than women. I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other men. ~amaral\/Sex_partners\/Content_sex.html > As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the Band Played On. He writes about bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture. That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and bathhouse culture played in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that there was a cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community. Tom","label":0}

{"text":"Kevin, Read everything over the weekend, and here are a few comments. Glad I did this yesterday, as not thinking too well at the moment as daughter-in-law in labour for the last 4 hours. No news yet - just waiting ! Haven't made any alterations yet. Here are my thoughts. 3.1 I'll make a few cosmetic changes - mainly to refer to the Appendices a couple of times re significance. Box 3.3 Reads better, will replace with this one when merge is done. 3.4 3.4.1.5 needs some work. Doesn't seem to read or flow that well. 3.4.2.1 Maybe need to expand on homogeneity tests. 3.4.2.2 4th para seems a little at odds with previous one? 3.4.2.3, 3.4.2.4 OK 3.4.3 Clouds. Needs some more work to develop a clearer message. You're aware of this. 3.4.4 Radiation. Similar comments to the cloud section. I have some specific notes for both. Despite this, probably OK for the ZOD. Maybe all we need to do is to highlight this to the reviewers. 3.5 Section seems overlong. I know you've reduced it a lot ! Contains a number of sentences where English could be improved. 3.5.1. OK 3.5.2 Significance levels for Fig 3.5.1 need some discussion. We'll need to work some on this Figure. 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 OK for the ZOD with a few better sentences. 3.5.5 and 3.5.6 Both sections seem overlong. Again know you've reduced this a lot, but if we need reductions here is a good place. 3.5.7 OK Box 3.5 OK 3.6 Generally good. 3.6.1 OK 3.6.2 Probably remove the impact para - leave for the moment, though. 3.6.3 OK 3.6.4 I can improve this a little. It isn't all Scandinavian glaciers that are advancing, just those in SW Norway. Those in the north of Sweden are retreating. 3.6.5 OK 3.6.6\/ 3.6.7 Basically OK. May need more re ACW and SAM link if we can say anything. 3.7 This is probably too long, so would be another area for some reduction. Agree on your suggestions for deletions as repetitive. 3.7.1.1-3.7.1.3 OK though all a little long. 3.7.1.4 This is the one where there is some repetition. Not much on monsoon. A lot here is already in 3.8 on extremes and the Dai et al (2004) paper is now referred to in 3.3, here and in 3.8. Suggest it should just be in 3.3 and again in 3.9 (it isn't there yet). Your figures seem in better shape than those in my section. We will likely need to work on the one Dennis is doing. Will need some colour. You're aware of which need more work from your comments. We can leave these in for reviewer and LA thoughts. Dave has sent me a first go at the figures. Made loads of suggestions. Dave was aware colour choices poor and will be doing more on them today. Is Chris Landsea the only person you've removed from the CA list so far? It seems so. I should have time tomorrow onwards to do merging and send out the 3 files to all our LAs. Are you happy with me merging in your refs list? I'll keep the discard ones at end in a separate list. Still hopeful of doing all this by close of play here on Thursday. All day in London on Friday and CRU party today week from 11am onwards. Going for Dec 16 means I will only be able to get some of the Figures in 3.2 and 3.3 properly into the text. Will send Dave's next Figure versions if they are much better. No point with current one. Still no news ! Cheers Phil At 21:16 10\/12\/2004, you wrote: Phil Attached are the three sections. Please use these for any suggested edits. Of the text, 3.7 is losest and needs careful comparison with 3.3 to check for inconsistencies. There is model stuff in there that is not quite right or incomplete: I removed some. There is reduncdant ENSO-related stuff. A lot of the monsoon variability is linked to ENSO and we could say that succinctly but it would decimate what the CAs and Panmao have done. I think we will need to do this in Beijing, but I left it for now. Note the refs has a list of discards at the end. Suggest we keep this, perhaps in a different file, and if stuff gets deleted with references, then the refs get moved there. Some of the figures are not quite in order in 3.6 and their is the extra figure that Dennis generated, not currently referred to. Key question is whether to follow up on this and how to make the multiple figs in 3.6 more compatible. I know you have suggestions on long time series and I urge you to keep in mind the purpose here: to show the past variability and place recent trends in that context. A lot could be done on indices and assoc plots, and patterns. I think we have license to do some of this as long as the figs are in literature. But we may not be able to reproduce the results??? I have hedged a lot on clouds and radiation, and maybe clarification will come? See if you think it is OK for now. Note these 3 versions are dated 1210: 10 Dec. They replace entirely the 1204 versions which you can discard. Kevin -- **************** Kevin E. Trenberth e-mail: trenbert@ucar.edu Climate Analysis Section, NCAR [1]www.cgd.ucar.edu\/cas\/ P. O.

{"text":"Looks good, just added one link. From: Walsh, Tom Sent: Friday, May 06, 2016 5:47 PM To: RR2 Subject: For research: This Week on the Campaign Trail It's been a disastrous week for the GOP. Now that Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both dropped out of the race, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Problems for Republicans extend far beyond the Cleveland convention, which many top GOP leaders have already vowed to avoid. With Trump as their nominee, any remaining hope Republicans had of concealing their true colors is gone. Party leaders shouldn't be surprised though - this was a crisis of their own making. For years, the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. Now they're stuck with the most reckless, dangerous and divisive nominee in modern history. In every primary contest, Republican voters continue to report in exit polls that their primary has been divisive - in some cases, more than half report they feel betrayed by their own party. Meanwhile, in poll after poll, Democratic voters are reporting that our primary has energized the party and that they're enthusiastic about our candidates. It's clear that the enthusiasm gap favors Democrats. From now until Election Day in November, Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his offensive rhetoric and dangerous ideas. We're fighting for the American people, and for the values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity for all. Looking to our convention in Philadelphia, we will not only emerge united, but we will nominate the next President of the United States. Supreme Court Vacancy It's been 51 days of Republican obstruction since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, passing the average amount of time it takes the Senate to hold a hearing on a nominee. While Republicans continue to avoid doing their jobs, Senators like Chuck Grassley have admitted it would be a \"gamble\" to allow Trump to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. And the American public agrees: 62% of voters don't trust Trump to nominate a new Supreme Court justice. If Americans agree that Donald Trump lacks the judgement to nominate a Supreme Court justice, when will the GOP? Job well done, Senator McConnell . The Campaign Trail Trump clinched his party's nomination, but something's not quite right... Will any former GOP nominees or presidents endorse Trump ? So far, it's looking pretty bleak. Mitt Romney, John McCain and the former Bush Presidents still have yet to throw their support behind Trump. But things got especially awkward when Paul Ryan, the highest ranking House Republican and chair of the Republican National Convention, said that he cannot endorse Trump. But Ryan, with his fellow Republicans, paved the way for Trump. From flip-flopping on campaign funding to calling the National Enquirer \"professionals ,\" Trump also reminded us this week that he's about as knowledgeable about foreign policy as Sarah Palin, and all he knows is what's on the internet . WATCH Even the former Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates took to the airwaves to question Trump's grasp of foreign policy, saying Trump is someone \"who doesn't understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers.\" Gates' comments are a reminder that Trump clearly lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. The New York Times described what Trump's first 100 days as president would look like, noting, \"many Americans are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office.\" Here is a brief summary : [tweeet-30","label":0}

Last week John McCain was caught talking about Trump's impact on his race, particularly with the Latino community, saying how Trump damages his reelection hopes. But yesterday, in a clear opportunity to buck his party's nominee in regards to the racist comments, McCain stood silent. When asked if he'd want Trump to retract his comments made against the Latino community calling them 'rapists' and 'criminals,' McCain said on CNN , \"Oh, I don't know.\" In the meantime, as more Americans favor a Senate vote on Garland's nomination, this weekend Senator Flake talked about why he's playing along with Senate Republicans in holding up Garland's hearing and vote. In an interview with Meet the Press , Flake said \"if we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him [Judge Garland] quickly because I'm certain that he will be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination come January.\" \"John McCain and Jeff Flake can't have it both ways,\" said Arizona Democratic Party spokesman Enrique Gutierrez. \"Either you stand with or stand opposed to Donald Trump. Trying to cherry pick Donald Trump's reckless positions for their own political purposes is just too dangerous for the people of Arizona. Trump has proven he doesn't have the temperament or judgement to be president, and if McCain and Flake stand with Trump's divisive agenda, voters will hold them accountable.\" ###","label":0}

We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive. We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works. Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12. Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget: Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year. Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM. Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the 2002 budget as well. The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year. Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant. For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business. The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs. Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, \"in progress\" or \"planned\" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date. In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002. If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them, please call one of us. Greg Piper Sally Beck Mark Pickering","label":0}

{"text":"Luis, Received the email below from the Arizona Republic late last night. Pratt and Deshundra said they're good with the changes, but I wanted to make sure to check with you. Let me know. Walter, Please see below the edited version of the op-ed by Rep. Wasserman Schultz. Appreciate if you'd run it by her. Arizona readers have heard a great deal about the long waiting lines, and the personal stories of those who waited have been well documented in the local press, so it would be better to get right to the news - the DNC filed a suit and here's why. The personal stories of the two women remain in the piece, just lower. Happy to discuss this further if you like - I'm at 602-316-9261. Thank you, Carrie Watters Editor, contributor network [azc_tar] PART OF THE USA TODAY NETWORK 602-316-9261 carrie.watters@arizonarepublic.com republicmedia.com azcentral.com * The Arizona Republic * La Voz Connect with azcentral on social media Facebook.com\/azcentral Twitter @azcentral Instagram @azcentral The reason the Democratic National Committee resorted to filing a lawsuit against Arizona this month is simple: the right to vote is sacred, and it is under attack in Arizona - a state with a particularly poor record of discrimination and disenfranchisement in minority communities. It's certainly no accident that so many of the long waits to vote in the March primary election occurred in Maricopa County, which is home to a large minority population. The state closed 70 percent of its polling locations, citing \"cost-cutting\" as the reason. But this is far more serious than a careless oversight, or a bureaucratic mix-up. Arizona is a state where conservatives banned bilingual education in 2000, where Sheriff Joe Arpaio has run roughshod over the rights of Hispanics with illegal traffic stop detentions, and where Hispanic, African American, and Native American voters have long faced undue burdens in exercising their most basic rights as citizens. The issue isn't just that voting locations were severely cut back. Many polling locations have been moved or changed, causing more unnecessary confusion. In fact, almost half of all Maricopa County polling locations changed between 2006 and 2008, and election officials actually have more changes planned before Election Day in November. These Republican laws and changes disproportionately burden students and young people who are more likely to move within a district, and those dependent on public transportation and the elderly, who are more likely to need assistance voting by mail. This is part of a much broader, deliberate and concerted effort by Republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters who are inconvenient to them on Election Day. And those voters are more vulnerable today than they have been in the past. When the Supreme Court decided a case called Shelby v. Holder three years ago, it gutted a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that has protected voters since the height of the Civil Rights movement. Before the Shelby decision, Arizona was considered a \"covered jurisdiction,\" which meant that the Department of Justice would review any changes to voting rules there to protect against precisely the type of irregularities voters faced last month. But since the Supreme Court poked a major hole in the Voting Rights Act, Republicans have used the opportunity to attack voting rights among groups who traditionally do not vote for Republicans in those previously covered jurisdictions. If no one steps in now, Maricopa County would become one of their greatest disenfranchisement success stories. This is completely wrong, and it's why this lawsuit is absolutely necessary. When teacher Luz Magallanes arrived at her polling place to vote in the Arizona primary before work, she hoped to share her voting story with her students later that day. But looking at the long lines, she decided to go to work and vote in the evening instead. When she returned, she had to wait in line for nearly five hours before finally casting her ballot. When Leslie Feldman arrived at her polling location with her two young daughters, she didn't expect an ordeal. In the course of waiting for nearly five hours, she found the voting center's one working bathroom was overwhelmed and leaking raw sewage onto the sidewalk. When she finally reached the front of the voting line, she was told they had run out of Democratic ballots. And when new ballots finally arrived and she cast her vote, she passed hundreds of people still waiting. These stories prompted those of us at the Democratic National Committee to file suit in the U.S. District Court of Arizona against the state officials responsible. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Kirkpatrick for Senate, the Arizona Democratic Party and eight individual voters, including Magallanes and Feldman, joined the suit. If successful, the lawsuit will restore federal election oversight of Maricopa County, and make it easier for voters to vote in locations near their homes or workplaces. It would also reverse a new Arizona state law that made it a felony for absentee voters to have signed and sealed ballots turned in for them, rather than having to mail them in - a practice used widely among minority groups to vote early. So this case isn't just about responding to what happened in March - this case is about the future. It's about restoring election protections long-needed and relied upon by Arizonans in time for the General Election. Democrats believe our country is stronger when every voice is heard and every vote is counted, and we will keep fighting to make sure the sacred right of every American to vote is protected. It's impossible to know how many people didn't vote because they couldn't spend the long hours waiting in line. But it is possible to make sure long lines, convoluted rules and unnecessary barriers to the ballot become a thing of the past. That's what this lawsuit is about. Every voter deserves a voice. Every election matters. And when a state passes laws that make it unduly difficult to cast a ballot, that state is out of step with American values, the law, and the Constitution. As Democrats, we're sending a clear signal that we will not stand for it. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, is chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.","label":0}

BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook. With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37.

BellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America. BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% WorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.

Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading.

{"text":"Did you have a chance to look at anything yet? If not, I can just send these over from me (SPA) and get a time set with Adam to discuss. Bob mentioned you suggested our SPA time later today.---------- Forwarded message ----------From: Minghella, Hannah Date: Tue, Oct 28, 2014 at 11:10 PMSubject: Re: HOTEL T 2 Dennis\/act 3To: Michelle Raimo Kouyate , \"Pascal, Amy\" Cc: \"Watty, Ariya\" Thanks Michelle. I agree with all your notes and especially cutting cakey. I want to think about any other suggestions for Dennis and will share any specific thoughts tomorrow. From: Michelle Raimo KouyateSent: Tuesday, October 28, 2014 6:22 PMTo: Pascal, Amy; Minghella, HannahCc: Watty, AriyaSubject: HOTEL T 2 Dennis\/act 3 I spoke to Adam earlier and gave him my general thoughts on Act 3 and talked to him about the idea of aging Dennis up a bit and giving him more of a POV. He was hesitant and said he needed to think about it, so I said I would write up some specific thoughts and ideas. He also asked for my specific suggestions for act 3. So after the general notes, I do get pretty specific and they are not as conversational. I do suggest getting rid of Cakey all together since he really makes Dennis play babyish -- and he is still being used to scare the fangs out of Dennis in Act 3 so if we keep that idea it may need to be a generic superhero.Let me know your thoughts as soon as possible and I can get him one set of notes.Notes:There are a lot of great changes in these pages, especially the third act . The scene with Dennis trying to be a bat is going to be heartbreaking and the new climatic battle with Bela in the woods is a fantastic new ending and works better than what we had before. We also love the scene when Drac stands up to Vlad \u2013 we think it's a moment that will get the crowd cheering for Drac. It feels like rhythmically there is some condensing to be done and that we need an on-point emotional tie up for Dennis and Drac (specific suggestions below). As I mentioned to Adam, it would be beneficial to us from both a marketing and a story perspective if we beef up Dennis' character and give him more of a point of view. Audiences want to see this kid interacting with the monsters and they love the idea of the Grandfather\/grandson relationship and we want to deliver on a character that is both memorable and special to this film. In general, let's age him up a bit and make him a little more self-aware and reactive to what is going on around him (think Jonathan Lipnicki in Jerry MacGuire). We just want to make sure his character and his interactions and relationships with the other monsters are everything they can be. Let's make him into a greater presence in the film and give him some more attitude and personality. Because you just turned the draft around, we want to offer some specific ideas and suggestions of things for existing scenes.On a similar front, the idea of this human kid in a monster hotel is a big one, so we'd love to find a few moments in Act 1 when we see Dennis interact with the monster-ness of the Hotel. What can a kid can get into inside the Hotel that could be monstery and fun? Like getting caught in one of the spa contraptions or crawling into a vat of spiders. Moments like these would help in the marketing of the film. Specific areas: In general, Dennis's use of \"cebause\" instead of \"because\" makes him sound very young. Let's consider having him say \"because\" anywhere there's a \"cebause\" to make him sound older. Page 23: Making Dennis more self-aware would help to \"age up\" his personality and maybe he recognizes in this scene that his attempts to fly aren't working.Page 23: To not make Dennis seem so baby-ish, maybe he doesn't cry in this scene. It could be enough that his lip quivers like he's about to cry, and this is enough to make Drac try anything so that he won't cry. Page 24-25: Dennis reads very young when he shouts out \"Video!\" and \"Yay! Video!\" Without those lines, he might read older. Page 27: When Wanda sprays Winnie to get her off of Dennis, maybe Dennis plays it more cool, like \"It's okay, Aunt Wanda, I can handle it.\" Page 26-30: In general during Wolfpup Party, it would help if Dennis had more of an attitude that he can hang with the monsters. (We love when he says, \"Best. Party. Ever.\") For example, when Mavis tells him to be careful, Dennis would seem older if he told his mom to stop because she's embarrassing him; he doesn't want to be treated like a baby.Page 41: In general, it would help to make Dennis more aware of what the monsters are teaching him and make him an active and willing participant. Dennis could be more interested and engaged with the lessons, and maybe he's really excited to learn monstery things or maybe he makes funny commentary of the monsters and how they don't seem so monstery. Here on Page 41, we could have a scene-let in which Drac tells Dennis he's going to get lessons in how to be a monster. Page 41: It's worth another conversation about Cakey because Dennis's love for Cakey makes him feel much younger than five years old. Dennis feels much older and more his age when he idolizes superheroes. Let's discuss.Page 42: When Drac yells at the monsters and asks \"What is wrong with you?\" it might be fun to have Dennis side with his grandpa and have an attitude like, \"Yeah, guys, what's wrong with you?\"Page 44: Instead of Dennis saying, \"Yay! He's gonna say 'boo'!\" maybe Dennis could play a little older here and interact with Frank. He could ask Frank some smart questions about what they're going to do.Page 47: We think it would help if Dennis was participating more in this scene only momentarily distracted by the avocado. Page 48: Instead of Dennis saying, \"Yay! Uncle Wayne got the frisbee!\" maybe Dennis is more aware that Wayne failed and could call out to Drac that this attempt didn't work. Another idea is that Dennis's takeaway from the lesson is that he thinks he has to catch a frisbee too. Page 52: Along the lines of making Dennis more self-aware of what Drac is trying to do with these lessons, maybe Dennis is excited here about what the Mummy is going to teach him. Instead of Dennis saying, \"That sounds mean,\" he could think it sounds cool. Dennis could even say something like, \"Papa Drac, I think this one's going to work\" indicating his desire to be a monster and is just as disgusted as Drac when Murray craps out.Page 60: Dennis sounds baby-ish when he says \"Papa Peepee!\" Maybe he could react by saying, eeew, it's gross. Page 101-102: We'd like to \"age up\" Dennis's dialogue in the Dog Fort scene. One way to do that would be to use \"because\" instead of \"cebause\" as suggested earlier. Also, maybe he could be more self-aware and knowing when he says \"They think I'm not happy because I don't have hair on my face like you. I'm sorry I'm not a monster.\" Also, Dennis sounds simple when he says \"You're nice, Winnie.\" Maybe he says instead that no one's ever told him he was perfect. \u00b7 Act 3: As promised here are some specific ideas condensing\/trimming for Act 3 and a few other thoughts:Pa Page 80: Not a cut but would be great to get an idea of what caused the rift between Drac and Vlad in this scene. Later on page 100 Drac says \"Because you won't change and because of that you lost me\" but not sure what that is in reference to. We did discuss the idea of putting back in that Vlad thought Martha's bloodline was impure and maybe that was it -- it would tie into his outrage over humans now. Page 86-87: Look at cutting the beat with Dennis and the cousins. It doesn't seem necessary anymore to show that the human kids are nasty to Dennis. Instead, let's start the scene with the Phantom's song and then transition to Johnny and his dad talking about Dennis's education.Page 91: We could cut Drac and Johnny talking about Johnny's accent. After Drac says, \"You look like you got a baboon's butt on your head,\" we could go right to Suit of Armor coming up and announcing that Cakey has arrived. Page 92-93: We could also cut the section with Frank's demonstration of Pig Latin, the menopause joke, and Frank re-introducing himself to Vlad. After Drac says, \"Always has to make an entrance,\" Drac could tell Frank to go take care of Vlad. Frank would then take Vlad over to Drac's friends and introduce Mummy, etc. (as he does in the current script). \u00b7 Page 104: Bela could call the cronies to the Hotel. Currently, it's Dennis's roar that awakens them. It would make more sense for Bela to summon reinforcements and if he calls a beat earlier it could help with timing of their arrival. Pa Page 106: We love that Drac and Mavis have a sweet moment at the end of the film, but we're missing an equally emotional moment between Drac and Dennis. So much of the film has been about Drac's relationship with Dennis \u2013 we feel it needs a resolution between them. Could we get a moment here where Drac apologizes to Dennis, tells Dennis that he loves him no matter what, and explains that he only did what he did because he wanted Dennis to stay? (Dennis had already left the Hotel when Drac said that to everyone earlier, so Dennis never got to hear this for himself.) Having one last dialogue here between Drac and Dennis could be very sweet moment at the end. ----boundary-LibPST-iamunique-1369549809_-_---","label":0}
{"text":"Looks good, couple eds From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Wednesday, May 04, 2016 4:58 PM To: RR2 Subject: AFT Talking Points for tomorrow media call These were pulled from our last set of TPs plus Shu-Yen's script and have been signed off by AFT. Research pls double check. Thanks * I am proud to lead the American Federation of Teachers, a union of 1.6 million education professionals. * We are a union of professionals that champions fairness; democracy; economic opportunity; and high-quality public education, healthcare and public services for our students, their families and our communities. * This week, we celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week. But unfortunately I need to speak with you about someone who doesn't appreciate teachers: Donald Trump. * We all know Trump has disparaged and denigrated women, Latinos, and Muslims, among other large swaths of the public. * Trump doesn't respect teachers or the education profession either. * Trump has called for eliminating the department of education. * He has fleeced students with his fraudulent Trump University scheme. * Trump has embraced the type of so-called reforms that de-professionalize and disrespect teachers. He would eliminate seniority and weaken our ability to negotiate contracts. * Let's remember that one of Trump's top surrogates, and possible running-mates, is Chris Christie. * Chris Christie as governor has been vehemently anti-teacher. We all remember the YouTube video of Christie screaming at a teacher during a town hall meeting. * Christie suggested last year that teachers should be making minimum wage , after he vetoed and stood against minimum wage increases. * As an aside, Chris Christie's polling numbers have dropped to 26 27 percent since he endorsed Trump. To put that in context - that's only two three points better than Richard Nixon's approval rating on the day he resigned from the presidency. * You might know that XX% 60% of the workers who make up our union are women. * Donald Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, and he's given them plenty of reason. * Last month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2016 when women's earnings have caught up with men's earnings from 2015. On average, women earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it's worse for women of color. But Trump doesn't support closing this gap with legislation. * Instead, Donald Trump said that women would have pay equity if they did 'as good a job' as men. * Donald Trump simply doesn't have the judgment or temperament to be President, and the American people know it. * For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain. * They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top. * Donald Trump's impending nomination after Tuesday's results is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strategy. Trump is the modern Republican Party. * Trump's Republican opponents didn't stand up to him because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, they didn't want to alienate them. * The Republican establishment is having trouble coming to terms with their nominee, and even some of them are acknowledging Trump is dangerous and lacks the judgment to be Commander in Chief. * Thank you.

Using this to preview your travels, or figure out where you are, would be very valuable. Online gaming continues to grow. Screw \"Britannia\", real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander\/ conquer\/explore virtually, in role-playing or real- time-strategy games. And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an ideal display substrate for all sorts of other overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D maps of everywhere which can have many other static and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. (Combining those last two thoughts: consider the static world map, in faded colors, with patches here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched over the static info in bright colors... it'd be like the \"fog of war\" view in games like Warcraft, over the real world.) - Gordon","label":0}

Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the budget presentation? I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me posted as to what the plan is. Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures. The file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail. Note that in our UE-115 ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the 2000-2002 budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend the money we have to refund it to customers. As an fyi - I've pasted in below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs. Q. What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS \/ IT Disallowance? A. After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be prudent. As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT investments, subject to a Staff audit. PGE will place into base rates 100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002 capital additions for the CIS\/IT capital items listed below. The 2002 revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the actual revenue requirement for the CIS\/IT capital costs. OPUC Staff will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS\/IT capital items listed below. 1. Customer information system. 2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system. 3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the meters). 4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs. Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until 2003. Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff audit procedures and standards. Only those costs that are reasonable and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the \"actual\" revenue requirement calculation.

{"text":"Donald Trump somehow thinks Ferguson and Oakland are dangerous like Iraq By Philip Bump May 18 at 1:33 PM In an interview with the New York Times, Donald Trump was asked about the most dangerous place he'd ever been. Trump and the Times's Robert Draper were watching the news, when reports of a bombing in Baghdad appeared. Draper asked Trump if he'd been to Iraq, prompting a reply of \"Never!\" -- \"sounding horrified by the thought,\" Draper adds. So what's the most dangerous place Trump has been? \"Brooklyn,\" Trump replied, joking. And then, apparently serious, he continued: \"There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously.\" Trump is correct that there are places in the United States that are the most dangerous in the world -- at least considering one particular data point, murder. A Mexican non-governmental organization called Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Publica y la Justicia (CCSP) tracks murder rates in cities with populations of 100,000 or more and compiles a list of those places where that rate is highest. [ There are four American cities on the CCSP's list of the top 50 most dangerous: St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit and New Orleans. St. Louis is the highest on the list, ranked 15th. The others are 19th, 28th and 32nd, respectively. Even St. Louis, the highest-ranking city on that list, falls far behind the No. 1 city -- Caracas, Venezuela. And not only is St. Louis's murder rate much lower than Caracas's, its actual number of murders is also far lower. There were almost 4,000 murders in Caracas in 2015 -- 21 times the 188 in St. Louis. In fact, St. Louis had fewer murders than any of the top 30 cities on that list. And notice something else that's missing from that list: Ferguson and Oakland. Oakland does have a high crime rate. While the CCSP tracks only murders, the FBI tallies data on a range of violent crimes, including assaults and rapes. During the most recent year for which full FBI data is available, 2014, Oaklandhad the third-highest rate of violent crime -- after Detroit and ahead of St. Louis. (It wasn't in the top 10 on its murder rate.) It's hard to compare those figures to international figures; murder is much more uniform in its definition than is \"violent crime.\" Ferguson is a different story. Ferguson is near St. Louis, but doesn't itself have a high crime rate. In 2012, it had the 23rd-highest crime rate of all cities in Missouri, out of 75 for which data was available. Ferguson was on the top of Trump's tongue for other reasons, of course. The police killing of Michael Brown that sparked nationwide demonstrations in 2014 has maintained relevance in the political conversation as questions about police use-of-force continue. For conservatives like Trump, \"Ferguson\" is often a shorthand for tensions between police and communities of color -- and support for the former. The city itself isn't particularly dangerous, but it gets blamed for violence elsewhere. Increases in homicides in a number of large U.S. cities in 2015 has been blamed on the \"Ferguson Effect,\" the idea that protests against excessive use of force by the police has spurred police to be less aggressive, resulting in more crimes. Our colleagues at Wonkblog looked at this in January, finding no link between police protests and the murder rate. In November, after a Black Lives Matter activist was roughed up at one of Trump's rallies in Alabama, he tweeted an incorrect image suggesting that most whites were murdered by black people, which is not at all the case. The fact that the two cities he named are ones that have associations that overlap with racial politics is probably not a coincidence. [ It's important to step back from Trump's comments, though, and consider the broader context. \"Crime rates\" -- meaning murder rates here -- are higher in some U.S. cities than some international ones, though the most dangerous cities internationally don't include either Oakland or Ferguson. But Baghdad isn't dangerous because of what you might call run-of-the-mill violent crime. It's dangerous because it's a target of terrorists. It's clear that cities in Syria or areas targeted by the Islamic State are far more dangerous than St. Louis, for a number of reasons. Within the context of \"how a city runs on a daily basis,\" sure, maybe Raqqa has some advantages over the worst neighborhood in the worst city in the United States. But expanding that context to \"places where you are in danger\" -- which is how one might normally define \"dangerous\" -- there's not really any comparison. Trump's answer was a political one, meant to redirect a weakness (his lack of international experience) into an advantage (reminding people, among other things, that he stands with Ferguson police). But the idea that Oakland and Ferguson -- or even Brooklyn, for that matter -- rank among the most dangerous places in the world is without merit.","label":0}

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 12\/28\/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Martin Updated 12\/28\/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver. Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 12\/28\/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 12\/28\/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. Joe Horn , WR NO - Matty Updated 12\/28\/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 12\/28\/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17. Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass\/Hull Updated 12\/28\/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 12\/28\/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Frank Updated 12\/28\/01 A banged-up Smith Toe\/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass\/Hull Updated 12\/28\/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's \"full strength\" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12\/28\/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. \"Still questionable,\" coach Bill Cowher said. \"He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.\" Doug Brien , K IND - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the ! cl! ub wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. Ahman Green , RB GB - Hunter Updated 12\/28\/01 According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report , Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings. James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 12\/27\/01 Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants. Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Matty Updated 12\/27\/01 Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass\/Hull Updated 12\/27\/01 The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday.

{"text":"Good, just one ed From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Thursday, May 05, 2016 6:49 PM To: RR2 Subject: FOR REVIEW: DWS ON YOM HA SHOAH DWS has signed off on this language. For Immediate Release May 5, 2016 Contact - DNC Press 202-863-8148 DNC Chair Statement on Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day \"Today we honor and remember the stories of the six million Jews and millions of others who perished in the Holocaust. We also celebrate the lives of those who survived, and the heroes who courageously fought the forces of ignorance, hatred, bigotry and brutality to end the Nazi regime and forge a brighter future for mankind. \"Although the final days of the Holocaust are in our past, we must forever carry its lessons in our hearts and remain ever-vigilant not to repeat the same mistakes. Just last week, in my home state, the FBI thwarted a plot by a man who was trying to bomb the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center. So our work is never finished, and we must work together to confront this kind of hatred and call out those who would incite others to violence wherever and whenever they do. \"The lessons of the Holocaust are especially important to remember during election season, when the rhetoric of national politics will no doubt get heated. On this Yom Hashoah HaShoah, the Democratic Party remains committed to the American values of inclusion and diversity, and we reject fear-mongering or the denigration of any group of people because of their faith, race or gender. Let us pledge today to continue to work to stop bigotry and hatred, knowing that our nation will be stronger for it.\" ###","label":0}

The December contract dipped $0.002 to $2.622 per MMBtu. The NYMEX will continue to trade in abbreviated session this week. Last week the AGA reported storage inventories rose by 91 Bcf for the prior week, well above the year-ago gain of 67 Bcf and the 5-year average injection of 77 Bcf. Total inventories of 2.848 Tcf are 446 Bcf, or 19% above last year, 264 Bcf above the 5-year average, and now stand at 86% full. The National Weather Service continues to call for below normal temperatures for the Eastern half of the nation and above normal in most of the West this week. Anticipated first-of-month cash indexes for October are $0.70 - $0.90 below September's indexes at the pipelines. Spreads between cash and futures widen considerably with much more incremental demand expected next month as some utilities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy sites go off-line for maintenance. Currently, there is about $0.50 per MMBtu difference between October cash and November futures. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.05 - $0.10 Friday, except out West where spot prices traded higher. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.07 to $1.82 per MMBtu. ------------------------------------------------------------- RISK MANAGEMENT Across the Energy Enterprise e-Acumen, Inc., is uniquely positioned to help you manage risk and increase value.

Electricity use by manufacturers has slowed along with the economy, and a milder-than-expected summer reduced demand. ----------------------------------------------------------- ENERGY. @ENERGY, FEA's Complete Suite of Energy Products, BUILT FOR THE FUTURE. *Manage all your energy risks. *Build and Price deals. *Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.) *Report and reduce your energy risks FEA FINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES main phone number: 1 510-548-6200 email address: info@fea.com --------------------------------------------------- PHYSICAL POWER PRICES | | High | Low | Average | | | $\/MWh | $\/MWh | $\/MWh | | Cinergy | 22.00 | 18.00 | 18.80 | | ECAR | 21.10 | 19.55 | 20.10 | | ERCOT | 17.75 | 17.00 | 17.50 | | Entergy | 18.00 | 16.70 | 17.25 | | TVA | 20.70 | 19.95 | 20.30 | | ComEd | 19.75 | 18.25 | 18.85 | | Nepool | 37.00 | 36.25 | 36.60 | | PJM West | 25.00 | 24.25 | 24.75 | | Main | 20.65 | 18.40 | 19.15 | | MAPP | 18.50 | 17.05 | 17.80 | | Palo Verde | 30.75 | 26.75 | 28.85 | | Mid C | 23.00 | 20.25 | 22.00 | | COB | 27.25 | 23.00 | 26.15 | | 4 Corners | 29.95 | 29.50 | 29.75 | | Mead | 30.95 | 27.75 | 30.10 | | NP 15 | 28.50 | 25.00 | 26.90 | | SP 15 | 27.95 | 25.00 | 26.45 | --------------------------------------------- What IfWe could give you MARKETPOWER for FREE*?

The commission has asked Congress to approve over $1.3 million for the addition of 10 senior level officials to monitor energy sales and actively look for market abuses. The agency currently has 50 people assigned to enforcement. The chairman says that even though the market has been moving towards deregulation for 10 years, the commission has not adjusted its examinations. The FERC is asking Congress to give it more authority to impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation, per day. Violators could lose the ability to base rates on market prices and be forced to charge only approved rates. The Electric Power Supply Association says members aren't afraid of additional market monitoring so long as it doesn't cross the line into political interventions every time there is a market fluctuation. High prices don't necessarily mean markets aren't working and can provide signals the market needs more power supply or a demand response. -------------------------------------------------------- Power Generation Sales Increase your sales of power generation equipment.

The new transmission company will be called Translink Transmission. It will be a for-profit company set up as part of FERC's 1999 order that investor-owned utilities join a RTO by the end of this year. The FERC has made RTOs a top priority since the California power crisis. RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk power across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Applicants for Translink Transmission consist of IES Utilities and Iowa and Interstate Power; Iowa's Corn Belt Power Cooperative; MidAmerican Energy; Nebraska Public Power District; Omaha Public Power District; and Xcel Energy. The utilities will participate in Translink through a combination of divestiture, leases and operating agreements. Translink will manage 26,000 miles of transmission lines and about 35,500 MW to about 6.9 million utility customers in 14 states. It expects to be in business by the end of next year. The new transmission company will also contract with the Midwest ISO for RTO services. Separately, a Canada's Manitoba Hydro has joined Midwest ISO. The agreement is the first international extension of a US based ISO. Manitoba Hydro has 5,200 MW of mostly hydroelectric power generation and provides energy to all of Manitoba except central Winnipeg. The coordination agreement allows the utility to participate in the ISO without violating Canadian law, which prevents Manitoba Hydro from signing the Midwest ISO's transmission owners' agreement. Manitoba and the Midwest ISO are both part of Mid-Continent Area Power Pool. -------------------------------------------------------- Ziff Energy Group presents the North American Gas Strategies Conference November 5 - 7 Calgary The Future of Western Canada's Gas Supply: Stretched to the Limit? & e-Solutions: Next Generation Concepts for the E&P Sector Join us for frank, in-depth discussion on the future of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.

Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron and Puget Sound Energy say they have received little assurance that the SCE intends to work out a payment plan with its creditors if the California legislature fails to pass a rescue plan. State senators adjourned last month without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package. The governor has called special session later this month to consider a bail-out, however it is unlikely the lawmakers will pass the measure in its present form. The current version of the plan does not allow SCE to use bonds sold under the measure to pay the generators. Since SCE supported that version of the plan, the generators want to know how they will be paid. An attorney for the companies says they want a simple yes or no to whether or not SCE is interested in negotiating a forbearance agreement. The generators contend that SCE can take steps to ensure that all creditor classes are treated equally, and payments can be made from existing funds or from a sale of secured bonds. -------------------------------------------------------- YOU DESIGNED IT.

{"text":"DNC Talking Points: Democrats Overwhelmingly United Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited about both of our candidates. By and large we've had a great primary, with substantive candidates whose vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the American people. And we're going to come out of our convention more unified and stronger than ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party. Just look at the new poll today from CBS\/New York Times: * A new CBS\/NYT poll shows that Democrats are more united today than in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into the 2016 election. * The poll showed that 72 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually elected to a landslide victory. * Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to Republicans, who are split 55%-43% between \"mostly hopeful\" and \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican Party. This echoes what we've seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : * Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they've been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut : * Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed. New York : * Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side. It's clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.

{"text":"Some edits below. Thanks! From: Wei, Shu-Yen Sent: Friday, April 29, 2016 3:31 PM To: RR2 Subject: For Research Approval: Asian Heritage Month Op-ed for NBC Asian America My Family's Democratic Party K.J. Bagchi - Director of AAPI and Small Business Engagement My family played a big role in why I became a proud member of the Democratic Party. My parents came to this country because, like many immigrants, they sought better opportunities for themselves and their children. They taught me that it was important to know what was going on in the world by having us watch the evening news each night. As I began to take a specific interest in politics, my father drove me to county Democratic Party meetings in our hometown of Reno, Nevada. I still remember him wearing his oversized gray wool jacket and wearing slippers you could only find sold in Kolkata, India. Going to these meetings, and discussing the issues later around the family dinner table started off as a hobby and passion that eventually led me the job that I have today. As the Director of AAPI Engagement for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), I spend a lot of time in similar discussions, and in subsequent actions, about how our big-tent party can keep improving on its mission of inclusion and progress. I consistently see our issues framed through my parent's eyes. As a first-generation American, I am grateful that my parents chose to made the choice settle in this country. Their story is the basis for my belief in treating everyone with respect and dignity. This is why I get so upset when I hear Republican presidential candidates target undocumented families and when they promote banning birthright citizenship or banning and tracking all Muslims in entering the United States. Democrats are fighting for comprehensive immigration reform and keeping immigrant families together under President Obama's Deferred Action programs for undocumented children and parents. My family has always respected the fact that Democrats have campaigned on increasing education access and lowering the costs of higher education. As professionals who have worked in the STEM field, they get frustrated whenever they see or hear Republican candidates deny climate change and refuse to do anything about it. Democrats are the ones pushing for investments in clean energy, calling for action to combat climate change, and leading the shift to clean energy, and proposing solutions based on scientific facts. But being right on the issues isn't enough - you need to have the campaign infrastructure to win elections and enact positive change. The DNC has invested and built up a voter file over several election cycles that allows us to continually engage the AAPI community through similar conversations on the ground. The online tool also allows us to identify if voters speak other languages, so we can accommodate them. As a result, staffers refine and add to the information within the system year after year, so it stays current and robust. For elections, our campaigns and state parties work with community groups to get out the vote. Our voter protection operation makes every effort to ensure access at the ballot box, because no one should have to deal with burdensome restrictions when exercising a fundamental right. This year, the DNC launched ProgressAAPI, a series of programs, trainings and conversations that build on the work that past-AAPI Democrats have done, such as social media actions, webinars on the convention, connecting youth to campaign opportunities, and events to get our message out. We want to make sure our policies that benefit working AAPI families are heard far and wide, and we will continue the Democratic tradition of meeting voters where they are, in person or otherwise. The policies and inclusion efforts of the Democratic Party are nothing new, but part of a long endeavor, the results of which are widely evident now. More than 50% of AAPI registered voters identify as are Democrats, and President Obama won 73% of the AAPI vote in 2012. Twenty years ago, the trend was just the opposite, with 74% of AAPIs voting Republican. And we understand the need to be continually engaged, even at the highest levels. President Obama has made a record number of AAPI judicial appointments, tripling the number who sit on the federal bench from eight to 25. All but one of the 14 AAPI Members of Congress are Democrats, and we are working to add to their ranks this election year. <--I'm seeing that there are 12 and all of them are Dems, let me know if I'm looking at the wrong thing The core principle that drives the DNC today is the same one that drew me and my parents in when I was a kid, that as Americans, we are greater together than we are on our own. Everyone deserves a fair shot to succeed, not just those already at the top. While we reflect on the advances AAPIs have made in our nation's history, we continue to push forward and demand greater progress with a Democratic Party that is part of the cause.","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Carl, This issue is now covered in the version of the manuscript that I sent out on Friday. The d2* and d3* statistics have been removed. The new d1* statistic DOES involve the standard error of the model average trend in the denominator (together with the adjusted standard error of the observed trend; see equation 12 in revised manuscript). The slight irony here is that the new d1* statistic essentially reduces to the old d1* statistic, since the adjusted standard error of the observed trend is substantially larger than the standard error of the model average trend...

Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican primary and Donald Trump becoming the GOP's presumptive nominee: \"Tonight, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Ted Cruz may have been the least-liked politician in Washington, but Trump is one of the least liked men in America, and Democrats will hold him accountable for his offensive rhetoric, dangerous ideas, and lack of judgment every single day between today and November 8th. \"While Ted Cruz was known for obstruction, having forced a government shutdown that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and even holding up opposing emergency aid for a region hit by a devastating hurricane, he didn't stand up to Donald Trump until it was too late. None of the Republicans running for president did, because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, they didn't want to alienate them. \"The decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain, have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump. The Republican Party sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump's looming nomination will be the ultimate, sad culmination of the results of that strategy. \"Democrats won't hesitate to fight for the vast majority of the American people, who share our values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity for all, and we'll hold Republicans on the ballot at every level accountable for their standard bearer. Voters will have a clear choice come November, and Americans of every stripe, including those disillusioned and disaffected by this year's unprecedentedly nasty Republican primary have a home in the Democratic Party. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day in November.\" ###","label":0}

{"text":"Dear Tim, Thanks very much for your email. I greatly appreciate the additional information that you've given me. I am a bit conflicted about what we should do. IJC published a paper with egregious statistical errors. Douglass et al. was essentially a commentary on work by myself and colleagues - work that had been previously published in Science in 2005 and in Chapter 5 of the first U.S. CCSP Report in 2006. To my knowledge, none of the authors or co-authors of the Santer et al. Science paper or of CCSP 1.1 Chapter 5 were used as reviewers of Douglass et al. I am assuming that, when he submitted his paper to IJC, Douglass specifically requested that certain scientists should be excluded from the review process. Such an approach is not defensible for a paper which is largely a comment on previously-published work. It would be fair and reasonable to give IJC the opportunity to \"set the record straight\", and correct the harm they have done by publication of Douglass et al. I use the word \"harm\" advisedly. The author and coauthors of the Douglass et al. IJC paper are using this paper to argue that \"Nature, not CO2, rules the climate\", and that the findings of Douglass et al. invalidate the \"discernible human influence\" conclusions of previous national and international scientific assessments. Quick publication of a response to Douglass et al. in IJC would go some way towards setting the record straight. I am troubled, however, by the very real possibility that Douglass et al. will have the last word on this subject. In my opinion (based on many years of interaction with these guys), neither Douglass, Christy or Singer are capable of admitting that their paper contained serious scientific errors. Their \"last word\" will be an attempt to obfuscate rather than illuminate. They are not interested in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of recent changes in atmospheric temperature. They are solely interested in advancing their own agendas. It is telling and troubling that Douglass et al. ignored radiosonde data showing substantial warming of the tropical troposphere - data that were in accord with model results - even though such data were in their possession. Such behaviour constitutes intellectual dishonesty. I strongly believe that leaving these guys the last word is inherently unfair. If IJC are interested in publishing our contribution, I believe it's fair to ask for the following: 1) Our paper should be regarded as an independent contribution, not as a comment on Douglass et al. This seems reasonable given i) The substantial amount of new work that we have done; and ii) The fact that the Douglass et al. paper was not regarded as a comment on Santer et al. (2005), or on Chapter 5 of the 2006 CCSP Report - even though Douglass et al. clearly WAS a comment on these two publications. 2) If IJC agrees to 1), then Douglass et al. should have the opportunity to respond to our contribution, and we should be given the chance to reply. Any response and reply should be published side-by-side, in the same issue of IJC. I'd be grateful if you and Phil could provide me with some guidance on 1) and 2), and on whether you think we should submit to IJC. Feel free to forward my email to Glenn McGregor.

{"text":"05\/09\/2016 07:40 AM EDT By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm) Good Monday morning, Illinois. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has gotta be feeling this one. A New York Times\/Kaiser Family Foundation poll released on Friday showed 62 percent of Chicagoans disapprove of how the mayor is doing his job. Just 25 percent approved. Among blacks, the numbers are more staggering: a full 70 percent disapprove of how the mayor is running the city. Blacks also held a deep dissatisfaction with the city's public school system and were more fearful of crime and gangs than white Chicagoans. This is a major blow to Emanuel, who is fighting to repair his image and community trust after the release of the explosive Laquan McDonald police dash-cam video last November. What's troubling for the mayor is that the poll represents recent views; it was conducted six months after the video release -- after the protests died down and after calls for his resignation have quieted. Democratic leaders have taken notice of the mayor's plummeting numbers. llinois Playbook has learned that discussions are already underway among power players with eyes on drafting a mayoral candidate for the 2019 election. Names already surfacing as possibilities: Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, Ald. Scott Waguespack, City Treasurer Kurt Summers, Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer and county commissioner Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. Read the poll results here:  The story: \"In Deeply Divided Chicago, Most Agree: City Is Off Course,\" by New York Times' Monica Davey and Giovanni Russonello: \"The people of Chicago are deeply riven by race, class and neighborhood, distrustful of the police, fearful of the growing rate of violent crime and united chiefly in their disapproval of the mayor's performance and their conviction that the city is headed down the wrong track. These are among findings of a new survey by The New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation, which polled residents of a city that has been upended in recent months by revelations of questionable actions by the police, threats of a teachers' strike, a school funding crisis and an uptick in violence. The poll finds broad discontent with the police and those charged with overseeing them, particularly among African-Americans. Residents expressed concerns about racial bias in shootings by officers and many show ambivalence about whether calling the police will ease situations or not make a difference.\"  WAPO'S TAKE -- \"Chicago residents think kids growing up there are as likely to be violent-crime victims as college graduates,\" by Washington Post's Mark Berman: \"In Chicago, a city confronting a staggering increase in homicides and patrolled by an embattled police department, 3 out of 4 four residents - and a higher share of black residents - say they are worried that things are heading in the wrong direction. People are also displeased with Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) and uneasy with the job being done by Chicago's police officers, according to a new poll. Among the starkest responses in a survey released Friday came when Chicago residents were asked about the young people who live around them. Those surveyed are as likely to think these young people will be victims of a violent crime as to graduate from college.\"  Welcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook.

Sun-Times sports front:  AMIRIDIS MAKES BUDGET CRACK -- At his commencement speech on Sunday, University of Illinois at Chicago's Chancellor Michael Amiridis talked about the tradition of wearing black robes at graduation ceremonies. According to one politically astute attendee, Amiridis first suggested that wearing the robes dated back to when teachers were clerics or priests. \"He went on to say perhaps they were worn for warmth. Then (he) speculated that in olden times maybe they didn't have a state budget, so they couldn't provide heat!\" Today: U.S. Rep.

A source with knowledge of budget talks also tells Illinois Playbook that there isn't expected to be an announcement this week from a legislator-led budget working group. Rauner on Trump: This video began circulating of Rauner at a news conference being asked about a Trump nomination:  BIG MONEY MOVEMENT -- The Illinois Campaign for Political Reform crunched the numbers and tallied up some of the biggest money transfers. Among them: the governor's committee handed the Illinois GOP nearly $1 million. Here's how it breaks down from ICPR: \"There were a few high profile transfers, including $1.8 Million from Turnaround Illinois to Liberty Principles PAC, and $975,000 from IllinoisGO to the Illinois Chamber of Commerce Super PAC. Citizens for Rauner recently transferred $900,000 to the Illinois Republican Party, and Turnaround Illinois transferred another $250,000 to Liberty Principles PAC in early April. Hard to keep track of all of that free flowing cash.\" HOUSE ALWAYS WINS -- \"BGA: Rivers Casino's winning tax appeal? Ignore our profits,\" by Better Government Association's Chuck Neubauer and Sandy Bergo: \"Of Illinois' 10 casinos, none is as lucrative as Rivers Casino in Des Plaines. Since 2012, it's reported revenues of more than $400 million a year after winnings - twice as much as any other casino in Illinois. That success makes its property quite valuable, according to Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios. But, year after year, Rivers' owners have argued that profits shouldn't matter when calculating how much the casino is worth. And each year they've gotten an appeals panel to override Berrios, giving them more than $4 million in property-tax cuts since the casino opened nearly five years ago.\"  NEWEST GOP TRUMP DOUBTER -- \"Hultgren: I'm not sold on Trump,\" by Daily Herald's Mike Riopell: \"U.S. Rep. Randy Hultgren, a Plano Republican, said Friday he's 'not sold' on Donald Trump, perhaps further deepening the split among Illinois GOP leaders over the party's presumptive presidential nominee. 'I am not sold on Mr. Trump -- not yet,' Hultgren said in a statement released a day after Gov. Bruce Rauner said he won't endorse Trump. 'I don't know if I'll ever be,' Hultgren said. 'I haven't yet been able to reconcile his differences with my strongly held beliefs on family and religious freedom, which I believe are the foundation for our country's well-being and identity.'\" BUDGET EXPERTS SLAM RAUNER PLAN -- \"Statehouse Insider: Was that a budget plan or a sham?\" by the State Journal-Register's Doug Finke: \"Gov. Bruce Rauner's administration often tries to deflect criticism by saying it's coming from people under the control of the all-powerful and decidedly evil House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago. But you're not going to find anyone who contends that the Civic Federation is just another Madigan tool. The nonpartisan organization has a solid reputation for strong analyses of government finances ... So when the Civic Federation issues a report that Rauner's budget plan is a bunch of hooey, people listen. Actually, hooey is being kind.\" STATE DEEMS CPS NOT IN NEED OF TAKEOVER -- \"Illinois Education Chief Decides Against Chicago Schools Takeover,\" by Reuters: \"Chicago's cash-strapped public school district is not in sufficiently bad financial shape to warrant a state takeover, according to an Illinois State Board of Education staff report. Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner launched a probe of the nation's third-largest school system in February, contending it could lead to state oversight and a suspension of borrowing at debt-dependent, 'junk'-rated Chicago Public Schools (CPS). However, the report from state school Superintendent Tony Smith, posted on the board's website ahead of a monthly meeting scheduled for Wednesday, said CPS does not meet 'any of the criteria' to be certified in financial difficulty.\"  HEALTH CARE VS. RAUNER HEATS UP -- \"SEIU Illinois files unfair labor claim on home-care work,\" by The Associated Press'' John O'Connor: \"The union representing Illinois home-care workers who must abide by new rules limiting overtime hours filed an unfair labor practices charge Friday against Gov. Bruce Rauner's administration. In its complaint, SEIU Healthcare Illinois argues that the state Department of Human Services should have negotiated overtime rules with it before they took effect on May 1. Rauner's office countered that Human Services isn't required to discuss changes in federal law. A Human Services spokeswoman chastised the union, likening the complaint to attempting to salvage a system that endorses 'slave labor.'\"  RAUNER + MADIGAN = FRENEMIES -- \"Enemies Rauner, Madigan not at odds when it comes to business,\" by Chicago Sun-Times' Chris Fusco, Tim Novak and Tina Sfondeles: \"The Chicago law firm headed by Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan, D-Chicago, has been hired to win property-tax cuts for two companies in which his nemesis, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, has a financial stake. That's among a wide range of personal business interests disclosed by the two powerful politicians, who are at the center of a 10-month state budget impasse that's hurt social service agencies, universities, homeless shelters and state vendors waiting to be paid, a Chicago Sun-Times analysis found.\" WHAT ARE THE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS LIKE? -- \"Mexico drug lord 'El Chapo' Guzman moved to Juarez prison,\" by The Associated Press: \"Convicted drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who twice pulled off brazen jailbreaks and is fighting to avoid extradition to the United States, was transferred early Saturday to a prison in Ciudad Juarez in northern Mexico, near the Texas border. Lawyers for Guzman, who was recaptured in January, have filed multiple appeals against their client being sent to the United States. Mexican officials have said it could take as long as a year to reach a final ruling. There was no immediate indication the transfer could be a sign that the process is nearing conclusion.\" PROTECTING 'GOOD-PAYING JOBS' -- \"Rauner: Keep nuclear plants in state's 'energy mix,'\" by Herald & Review's Edith Brady-Lunny Lee: \"Gov. Bruce Rauner said Friday he hasn't had a chance to review legislation proposed to help financially struggling nuclear power plants in Clinton and the Quad-Cities, but he considers nuclear power important to the state's 'energy mix.' Answering questions during a visit to Bloomington, Rauner said, 'Nuclear plants have have a lot of good-paying jobs' that he doesn't want to lose. But he added, 'I'm concerned when a big company says in order to stay in Illinois, they need a big taxpayer subsidy.'\"  SPREADING OUT THE NOISE -- \"O'Hare noise plan solves some problems, creates new ones,\" by Chicago Tribune's Mary Wisniewski: \"As early as next month, the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to test a new plan for rotating nighttime flights in and out of O'Hare International Airport, something supporters say will spread the pain of jet noise, but opponents worry will hurt the northwest suburbs. The O'Hare Noise Compatibility Commission, made up of municipalities and school districts around the airport, approved by a 45-5 vote on Friday a 'Fly Quiet' plan that will alternate which runways are used for arrivals and departures from week to week.\" NOT THE KIND OF GROUP DISCOUNT THEY WANTED -- \"Groupon does small round of layoffs in Chicago,\" by Chicago Tribune's Amina Elahi: \"Groupon laid off about 30 people from its customer service department on Thursday, mostly in Chicago, a week after reporting earnings and installing a new chief financial officer. 'Earlier today we parted ways with approximately 30 people in our customer service organization as part of our ongoing streamlining program,' Groupon spokesman Bill Roberts said in an email. 'Those affected will receive full severance benefits.' Roberts said Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) continues to employ hundreds in its customer service division. He said most of those affected by the cuts were Chicago-based, while a few were remote workers.\"  EVENTS h\/t to IntelligentEvent TODAY The Current State of the Illinois Budget - City Club of Chicago - Rauner is reaping the budgetary fruits of Madigan has sown for years.

{"text":"Date:May 16,2002. Email:edum@hkem.com. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story here for our story is indeed interwoven with the history of the world and the liberation struggle in the Southern African region of the African continent. The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an encounter with the government forces of the MPLA government of my country.The rest is now history but suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at least for the interim period until I am sufficiently sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. Needles to say I was the single most important commander who was very close to the late supreme commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great deal.The result of such trust is my reason for contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) with a security\/finance company in South Africa.This was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 in the United States of America.Indeed it had become increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money around the world particularly for a liberation movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the money with the security company in South Africa. I have decided to inherit this money which was taken out and deposited with the said security\/finance company as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is kept in my signature and would have been used in the purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme commander is dead and as already stated I have decided to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have been able to establish contact with the company in South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to take possession of the money that I kept with them. Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola (Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% of the $32million.Please come back to me through email: edum@hkem.com.The security\/finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the $32million. Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to state your residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands.

{"text":"It's the moment that Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have been waiting for - to lay the pathway for a Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans have refused to consider and allow a fair process for Chief Judge Merrick Garland, failing to do the job they were elected to do by the voters. And Dangerous Donald is whom the GOP has chosen to make critical decisions in leading our nation, including filling the Supreme Court's vacancy. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley-a staunch opponent of doing his job and considering the President's nominee-has even conceded that it would be a \"gamble \" to let Trump fill the SCOTUS vacancy. The American people agree-62 percent of voters don't trust Donald Trump to nominate the new Supreme Court justice. In fact, the GOP's presumptive nominee is now the most unpopular major-party nominee in American history. A recent CNN\/ORC poll found that 64 percent of women, 73 percent of non-whites, and 37 percent of conservatives say they dislike Trump. The American public understands that Dangerous Donald lacks the judgement to nominate a Supreme Court justice. When will the GOP? Here's what some people are saying: Some conservatives are starting to realize blocking Merrick Garland is a big mistake VOX \/\/ DYLAN MATTHEWS With Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, the stakes for the Supreme Court have become startlingly clear. The position of the Senate GOP under majority leader Mitch McConnell has always been that the next president should decide on Antonin Scalia's replacement - and that, accordingly, they will not so much as consider Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. Now that position translates to: We think Donald Trump should pick the next Supreme Court justice. Dems: Trump wins us the Senate and Garland POLITICO \/\/ EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE Donald Trump threw a big party Tuesday night. So did every Democrat running for Senate. The party's Senate candidates are brimming with excitement about spending the next six months hitting their opponents with Trump - and being able to tie their case together by saying that Republicans' opposition to President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick means they want a President Trump to fill the vacancy. Donald Trump Has Put the GOP in an Impossible Position on Merrick Garland NEW YORK MAGAZINE \/\/ ERIC LEVITZ ... Recent polls show that a majority of Americans believe Garland deserves a hearing. A new PPP survey of Ohio found 65 percent of voters saying that Obama's pick merits formal consideration. Granted, there probably isn't a human being in America (with the possible exception of Garland himself) whose main concern when selecting a senator is whether or not he or she will hold hearings whenever they're appropriate. But with Trump at the top of the ticket, swing-state Republicans will want to assure voters that the GOP is not a radical party. It will be difficult for Portman to do that while refusing to recognize the president's constitutional right to appoint Supreme Court justices. The GOP's Supreme Court wreck: Nominee Trump puts obstructionist Republicans in an impossible position SALON \/\/ SIMON MALOY The words \"presumptive nominee Donald Trump \" present a political problem for Republicans as they try to reconcile the tension between party loyalty and Trump's uniquely toxic identity. ... Well, Republican voters have had their say, and they chose Donald Trump. So the official position of the Republican leadership in the Senate is that they can't confirm Merrick Garland or any other nominee because the former host of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" deserves to be given a crack at determining the future of the high court. ... They can keep obstructing and making the case that the nomination should be decided after the new administration takes power, but they'll be doing no favors to themselves or their colleagues up for reelection. Grassley's approval rating in Iowa has taken a massive hit since the SCOTUS obstruction started, and vulnerable Republicans in blue and purple states across the country are going to be caught between Donald Trump, their party leadership, and the voters as they struggle to explain why there shouldn't be a vote on Obama's nominee... Grassley himself has acknowledged that letting Trump fill vacancies on the Supreme Court is \"a gamble.\" View this post on our Factivists site here .

{"text":"---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Jeff Heuermann Date: Thu, Oct 16, 2008 at 10:04 AM Subject: NSM question To: commander@newsaxon.org Commander Schoep, I know you may be busy so I will keep this sweet and simple. Like you I am an American with a pure German heritage. I am first generation and very proud of being of German blood. I have attached a pic of myself so you can see who you are emailing. Never mind the fact I am laying down with my Dane pup. I want to know if the NSM is dedicated to actually fighting for the white race? There are a lot of \"organizations\" or \"parties\" out there that just want to hold signs, create a shock factor, and just stir momentary anxiety. These groups are just a bunch of posers and I want to know where the NSM stands. The time is getting critical for our race to start standing up for itself and for our race to stop handing over power to the greedy-ass jews and the blacks that cry about anything and everything; who want money from us for their ancestors' time in slavery. There has been a great lack of success on the part of the \"white movement\", if you will. A party is going to have to start standing up and grabbing the people's attention and emotions but no party is doing that. This part is tricky but please read the whole thing even though it sounds crazy...we all need to start thinking in a big picture mind-set and strategically. Obama is going to be President and the White Civil Rights movement (to use your words) need to embrace this. White people, from the right, are getting stirred up emotionally and starting to see who they really are and what is REALLY going on. They are starting to realize that a black is going to be President and it isn't sitting well with them and of course, it shouldn't! Obama will be under the microscope with every little thing he does wrong greatly mediated. Obama used to talk about being for reparations. He will try to pass such a bill and it will end up being the switch to turn people against him and the blacks. There is much more to it but I am sure you see my point and why Obama for President should be embraced. There could be a back-fire and that would be if Obama was the best President in the history of the country lol. Anyway, I want to be a part of a party who is hell-bent on moving the white civil rights movement forward and create more than any other civil rights movement ever has. It can be done but political strategy is a key factor. Hitler knew how to grab people's attention and he knew when to make certain moves to further his and the NSDAP's goals. We need the same thing! We do not have a leader in the white sector who is serious about taking this forward, that I have seen yet. Everyone is content with just holding signs and yelling slogans. I am not saying we need to advocate violence but the white movement has been stagnate and impotent since the 30s-40s. The awarding of freedoms to blacks and the power grab of the jews is evidence enough of this fact. Anyway, I would love to speak to you further: 719-321-9381. This is my cell and you can reach me on it from 1130-2015 ET. I live in the mountains and do not get a signal before or after those times. I know it all may sound crazy or far-fetched but I have been studying political strategy for many years. I view Carl Rove as a kitten not someone of great strength, although he is feared in the political arena by many. Below is an article you may find interesting and may help to show how others are coming up with the same points I made. The fear it. We need to grab it and use it to our advantage! We need to get started. Respectfully, Jeff Heuermann OBAMA AND THE \"PROFESSIONAL BLACK-VICTIMS CARTEL\" By Tom DeWeese October 16, 2008 NewsWithViews.com Americans beware. In the future, should you disagree with \"President\" Obama, apparently you will be labeled a racist. As has been highly reported, Democrat Representative John Lewis of Georgia said McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin were \"sowing the seeds of hatred and division\u2026\" In the same breath, Lewis then made a comparison to George Wallace. The reference to Wallace can only mean one thing \u2013 racism. It seems the attacks were made because McCain and Palin have started to comment on known associates of Obama who have questionable backgrounds. Obama has tried to get people off the trail of these associates by saying it was a long time ago, not relevant, and so on. When that didn't work, Obama's troops played the race card even though John McCain has made no reference to Obama's race. The fact is Obama's relationships to known communists do matter. They speak to his character. They show who influenced him in his political choices. And they tell us something about what an Obama Administration may be interested in pursuing as policy. Could Obama, himself, be a communist? Is it a fair question when discussing his qualifications and deciding how to cast a ballot? Obama says no \u2013 it's racist. Is it fair to look at the statements and records of those around Obama \u2013 those who openly support him, those being paid by his campaign? Obama says no \u2013 racist. But that doesn't prevent Obama and his group to look at who surrounds and supports John McCain \u2013 right wing fringe \u2013 they tell us. Isn't that another term for racist, according to them? There are lots of questionable characters in Obama's immediate circle, including Bill Ayres. Bill Ayres still travels to communist countries in support and praise of policies which rob individuals of their rights and personal possessions. For instance, in November, 2006, Ayres traveled to Venezuela to attend an education forum. That's a nation quickly falling behind a new curtain of tyranny under President Hugo Chavez. With the great dictator by his side, Ayres proclaimed his support for \"the profound educational reforms under way here in Venezuela under the leadership of President Chavez. We share this belief that education is the motor-force of revolution\u2026I look forward to seeing how you continue to overcome the failings of capitalist education as you seek to create something truly new and deeply humane\u2026\" Is it fair to wonder if Obama might consider Ayres' ideas on education and Capitalism as his own? And if they share those ideas, would it be too far fetched to wonder if perhaps Obama could even consider Ayres, or someone like him, to be his Secretary of Education? Personal relationships matter.. Obama is upset that McCain crowds are calling him a terrorist. How absurd, says his campaign. Just mean spirited. But Ayres was\/is a true-life terrorist. He was a founder of the Weather Underground. They planted bombs in the Capitol Building. They killed cops. They called for the overthrow of the United States as they sided with our enemy in Vietnam - the same communists who, at the time, were holding John McCain prisoner. And Ayres held a fund raiser for Barack Obama. Does it matter? How about Obama's relationship with ACORN. Obama's campaign paid them some $800,000 to register voters. Fraud has been found in several states as ACORN has turned in voter registration forms with multiple addresses and social security numbers for the same name. ACORN has endorsed Obama. But to question the possible connection to ACORN's vote fraud and Obama's campaign is just racist. Finally, there is Louis Farrakhan, the head of the Nation of Islam and one of the most documented white-haters in the nation. Farrakhan, by the way, is associated with Obama's minister, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, but that would be racist to point out. **********But let's look at what Farrakhan said on February 24, 2008 to a Nation of Islam Savior's Day gathering. \"You are the instruments that God is going to use to bring about universal change, and that is why Barack has captured the youth. And he has involved young people in a political process that they didn't care anything about. That's a sign. When the Messiah speaks, the youth will hear, and the Messiah is absolutely speaking.\" Farrakhan had earlier suggested he would keep a low profile in the campaign, despite his enthusiasm for Obama. Does it matter that Obama attracts the support of the man who openly hates whites more than any other? What does Farrakhan know about Obama's positions that attract him? **********Here is something that may provide some insight into Obama supporters use of the race card. In 2007, it was learned that the University of Delaware has a mandatory program that requires residence hall students to acknowledge that \"all whites are racist.\" The program went on to offer misguided whites \"treatment\" for incorrect attitudes regarding class, gender, religion, culture or sexuality they might hold upon entering a school. **********Now, why did the school think all whites are racist? Because this is their definition of racism: \"A racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist (racist) system. The term applies to all whitepeople (i.e., people of European descent) living in the United States, regardless of class, gender, religion, culture, or sexuality. By this definition, people of color cannot be racists, because as peoples within the U.S. System, they do not have the power to back up their prejudices, hostilities, or acts of discrimination.\"The school's policy deserves mention because it is advocated by most self-appointed black leadership.. **********There you have it. Blacks can't be racist, because they don't have power over anyone. Only whites can be racists. So for Obama and his people to call McCain or anyone racist is simply a way of saying \"Hey, Whitey! Pity the struggling middle class black Americans who simply work to better themselves with nice homes in the suburbs, nice schools for their kids, nice cars and clothes- all the things any of us want. Unfortunately for them, the \"Professional Black Victims Cartel\" run by the Jesse Jacksons, Al Sharptons and Barack Obamas accuse them of selling out \u2013 indicating they are \"Uncle Toms\" who are just trying to be white \u2013 turning their back on their ghetto brothers. There is no win for these folks. By their definition of racism, they become racist themselves, oppressing their own kind. And for lower income blacks who may have dreams of their own, the \"Cartel's\" message is clear: their destiny is to be victims for life. For the record, before we completely lose the English language to such gibberish, the true definition of a racist is one who hates another simply because of the color of his skin. Funny, wasn't it Martin Luther King who dreamed of the day when people would be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character? Apparently Barack Obama is no Martin Luther King. So get ready America. If we get \"President\" Obama, any opposition we voice against his \"compassionate\" policies to redistribute our possessions to the \"victims\" will be met with charges of racism. As Louis Farrakhan has told us, the Messiah has spoken. (c) 2008 Tom DeWeese - All Rights Reserved ------------------------------ Stay organized with simple drag and drop from Windows Live Hotmail.

On top of that, the fact that the New Mexico GOP endorsed Donald Trump for president, and their highest ranking Republican official, Governor Susana Martinez, has refused to endorse Trump, exemplifies chaos in the Republican Party, in our state, and across the country. \"Make no mistake, the New Mexico GOP will work to elect Trump as the next United States President, which shows a vehement disregard for the interests of our communities.

We will want to help frame our messaging with respect to where we are as a party and also where we see a contrast with the GOP candidates as we head into November. We want to tell them how to look at the race in the coming months. TALKING POINTS: Topline Message: Last week in five states we saw Democrats voting with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most \u2013 and Republicans holding their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike least. In Pennsylvania, exit polling showed that 71 percent of Democratic voters felt their primary had energized the party while 58 percent of Republican voters said their primary had divided the party. That's what we saw in New York, where just 39% of Republicans thought their campaign has energized their party while in Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Republican primary voters said they fear what a Trump presidency would do to our country. And roughly a third would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a Democrat than support either Trump or Cruz. That's stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading into November in a far stronger position than Republicans. On the other side, it's hard to pick what's been a stranger story the past week -- Trump changing his mind on whether to act Presidential, or Ted Cruz teaming up with Carly Fiorina in a last ditch \u2013 and inevitably unsuccessful \u2013 effort to stop Trump. Trump is gaining momentum. - He reached over 50% in last week's five contests, even hitting 60% in two of those (Delaware and Rhode Island). - And, heading into tomorrow's primary in Indiana, it's clear that Trump is close to wrapping up the GOP nomination. According to the latest NBC News\/Wall Street Journal poll, Trump leads in Indiana by 15 points [Trump 49%, Cruz 34%, Kasich 13%]. This is despite Cruz's superior campaign infrastructure in the state. Republicans are going to have to come to terms with Trump being their nominee and what that means. Just yesterday former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who served under both a Republican and Democratic Administration, said that he's troubled by the fact that Donald Trump doesn't listen to anyone, and raised serious questions about Trump on foreign policy. Between his contradictions and threatening our most important alliances, it's clear Dangerous Donald lacks the judgment and temperament to serve as our next Commander in Chief. For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain. They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump's impending nomination after Tuesday's results is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strategy. Trump is the modern Republican Party. It's clear that when we get through our conventions, Democrats will emerge united having nominated the next president, while the GOP will have to wallow in the chaotic mess of their own making. Sanders Comments Yesterday About a Contested Convention \/ Arizona Lawsuit We're going to be united at our convention, and we're confident in our process, which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our candidates. It's not our job to handicap the race, our candidates will determine the future of their own campaigns. Both Senator Clinton and Senator Sanders have been clear they'll work hard in November to ensure we don't let a Republican like Trump or Cruz drag our country backward. So I'm confident we'll be united. We've cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will rise. Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another, but their differences remain focused on how to best move America forward. They're focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive, and that we respect everyone in America. If you want to talk about a rigged process, we're doing that too. The Democratic National Committee and our Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfranchised as a result. We want to make sure that doesn't happen in November. If you want to talk about rigging elections, that's the real example, and it's a serious problem and we're glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the American people to vote. - In Maricopa County, officials reduced the number of polling locations to just 1 for every 21,000 people. That's seven times what it was in other parts of the state, and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that Republicans are championing all across the country. - And it's not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from Wisconsin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could now win Wisconsin because of the Voter ID law. It was his Kevin McCarthy moment, and the type of rigging of the system we're not going to put up with. When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain that the Democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republican candidates. Joint Fundraising Committees We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties, which is why stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle. The DNC is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee, and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure NOW that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. It's important to note, the funds that the DNC and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping us build infrastructure for the general election. These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. ***The DNC remains committed to our state parties. Since 2009, the DNC has sent $24.5 million to the states for the State Partnership Program and $170 million to states for all purposes.*** And let's be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising. Sanders\/DNC Lawsuit - We are glad that this issue has been resolved and look forward to continuing to work with both campaigns to facilitate a successful primary campaign process. - Background on Resolution: The forensic analysis conducted by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike confirmed that the DNC's initial findings, which were the basis of the temporary shutdown in December, were accurate. The audit confirmed that one campaign gained unauthorized access to the data of another, and the audit further confirmed that the results of those searches were saved within the system and that data was exported. Following the conclusion of the audit that confirmed the DNC's original findings, the Sanders campaign withdrew its lawsuit. Chaos in Cleveland vs Our Next President in Philadelphia We're less than 100 days from the July conventions, and it's clear that Democrats will emerge united, while Republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency. - Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual Democratic nominee. - Last week, Senator Sanders said at a town hall on MSNBC that he will do everything in his power to make sure no Republican gets into the White House in November. - And Secretary Clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress we've made under Democratic leadership over the last 7 years. Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate. Democrats know that we're stronger when more voices are heard, and when we stand together to move our country forward, we'll see that in Philadelphia at our convention. Compare that to the Republicans. Last week, the increasingly desperate Cruz and Kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop Trump, but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was happening. A majority of Trump supporters said they would abandon the Republican Party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third-party candidate. Even Republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive convention. You've already seen Republican candidates in tight races, like Senator Kirk in Illinois and John McCain \u2013 the GOP nominee eight years ago \u2013 say they will not attend their own convention in Cleveland. But don't let them fool you, they're not any better than the top of their ticket. Clinton's Speeches and Sanders' Taxes Our job at the Party isn't to handicap our own primary, we're not going to referee. There are real differences, but they're with the Republicans, and while you have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp differences, they're also highlighting what a much better option voters have with Democrats. Just look at the issue of taxes as millions of Americans filed last week, but most of them didn't get to take advantage of special loopholes or get special breaks. Yet every single Republican plan for the economy is based on tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale. It's exactly the economic policy that the Bush Administration had as they drove us toward the great recession. So ultimately those are the differences that will matter most in November. GOP Frontrunner Trump is Reckless and Dangerous - The Economy: Trump's unfounded predictions of recession and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless, and economists have already predicted his policies could start an international trade war and cause a global recession. - Foreign Policy: Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances in NATO sends a dangerous message, which is particularly troubling in light of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Nuclear Proliferation: Trump has refused to say he wouldn't use nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea and Japan should either develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protection against North Korea. - On abortion: Trump has taken multiple positions on abortion - from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to saying he would allow states to restrict women's rights, to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments. Cruz The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him! - Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate would object if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing him over Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot. - Senator Jim Risch of Idaho \u2013 TWICE \u2013 gave one of the most passive, non-endorsement endorsements I've ever seen. It's going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don't like! The GOP's Problem with Women Voters - Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nominee. - Kasich said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade repealed, and when asked what kind of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying that it should be left to the states. - Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term. - In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed equal pay, family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Act. Earlier this month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2016 when women's earnings have caught up with men's earnings from 2015. On average we earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it's worse for women of color. All of the Republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace. - John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don't need workplace protections, just a 'change of heart' among major employers. - Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a 'show vote.' Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did 'as good a job' as men. Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact It's fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so long. Since 2004 they've used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border security. They've given birthers like Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the economy. Then while in office, the only thing Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is obstruct. Trump IS the Republican Party. Advantage, Democrats Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it matters. Senator Clinton has earned more than 10 million votes \u2013 Over a million more than Donald Trump \u2013 while Senator Sanders has earned more than 8 million votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar donors. If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Democrats. Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats raising a total of $72.1 million in February and 67.5 million in March, eclipsing Republicans' fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for Cruz, $6 million for Trump, and just $3.4 million for Kasich in February. And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, his latest report with the FEC shows that he has loaned his campaign $24 million throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 million from outside contributors and loans for the entire cycle. Democrats will have the strongest candidate in November. Period. And we are poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the House. Broad Contrast and Infrastructure We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the Republicans nominate. We see the numbers of course; it's clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we're ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention. But we don't think taking on Trump is fundamentally different from any of the others. At least with Trump, he's not shy about exposing what the Republican brand has truly become. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as extreme as their party's front-runner, they just hide it a bit better. They promise the same extreme agenda on women's rights, they deny the threat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to citizenship. They all want to drag America back to the failed economic policies of the last Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a month and having plunged our country into the Great Recession. And they've all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, using language that alienates our allies, helps ISIS recruit terrorists, and makes America less safe. So if it is Trump, we're ready. Maybe it's Cruz, but it's hard to see how that comes together in the end. But regardless we're building a ground game and an infrastructure that's ready to challenge him on every single position he's taking on the campaign trail, and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the American people.

{"text":"Dear Mike Thank you for sending the outline bid submitted last October. After reviewing the document, my colleagues and I were of the view that TERI should go non-exclusive.

This gives you a quick idea about our Consortium and plans. You will also see the names and institutes of our partners. May I re-iterate that this document is confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone outside your immediate colleagues in TERI. TERI was *not* listed as a formal co-applicant (non-UK institutions are not eligible to be formal co-applicants), but was listed as an 'affiliated organisation' along with about 10 others here in the UK. We would propose to do the same in the final bid, but say a little bit more about where and how TERI would interact with us were we to win the Centre. If you decide to remain exclusively with our bid, then I will send you the first draft of our final submission during the next week - this will indicate more details about our research programmes and where TERI may be seen to interact with us as a key overseas collaborator. However, if you decide to join with both bids - Imperial and UEA - then we will simply continue to list you as a collaborator, but we could not then agree to any further interaction over the next 2 weeks.

Just for complementary info on the data file a rough plot of the data in the file erikII.dat in comparison with NH avgs in ErikI: ErikI-II.ps Also for commplementary info, I attach nhavg.jpg and nhano.jpg...plots of anomalies and absolute values in the NH for all the forced runs: columbus erikI,II and control. Let me know if there are any queries or problems. Best regards Fidel ps.- I will be glad to have a pdf of the magicc paper when you consider it appropriate. Congratulations for this. Tim Osborn wrote: Hi again Fidel, we are in the very final stages of preparing a revised figure for the IPCC and so your email has come at just the right time (if you can provide the data quickly). Assuming the forcings are identical to erik1, then all we would need is a time series (in plain text) of annual-mean NH temperature. If you can provide this, then we can include it. (My paper comparing erik1 against a simulation with the simple energy balance model MAGICC has at last been accepted by Climate Dynamics - there were no problems at all, just very slow reviewers and very slow editorial decisions!).

You mentioned then that it might be of interest to include these data in the IPCC rep. Let me know what you need for this when it suits you. I attach the pdf. Thanks a lot for that btw.

{"text":"guys, I see that Science has already gone online w\/ the new issue, so we put up the RC post. By now, you've probably read that nasty McIntyre thing. Apparently, he violated the embargo on his website (I don't go there personally, but so I'm informed). Anyway, I wanted you guys to know that you're free to use RC in any way you think would be helpful. Gavin and I are going to be careful about what comments we screen through, and we'll be very careful to answer any questions that come up to any extent we can. On the other hand, you might want to visit the thread and post replies yourself. We can hold comments up in the queue and contact you about whether or not you think they should be screened through or not, and if so, any comments you'd like us to include. You're also welcome to do a followup guest post, etc. think of RC as a resource that is at your disposal to combat any disinformation put forward by the McIntyres of the world. Just let us know.

Anyways I will tell you once again: The 'pending issue' about infection over 3G network is not within our control, we have demonstrated that it is able to do the infection within the Wi-fi environment, please in the meantime check again if these 'issues' are indicated at any point in the acceptance document. If you can't organize the pick up I will take a taxi, just send me the address.

Moreover for the 2nd point, we have no control over the ip address (dynamic or static) and what ports are allowed as its allocated by the service provider. To summarize, these 2 \"issues\" you mentioned are not even issues. The 1st point I can accept it as a feature request and we are planning to support it Q1 or Q2 next year. The 2nd point is a constraint from the service provider. As demonstrated, there are also physical infection or infection over Wifi which the customer can use. -- Serge Woon Senior Security Consultant Sent from my mobile.

{"text":"Dear John and Mike It was over two years ago that we first briefly discussed the opportunity to develop climate change research funding in Scotland using a grant to HEI's from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). My Centre, CECS, has been successful with such grants in the past. Last year there were no such grants but the opportunity has now arisen again. The funding is quite large (0.5 - 1.5 million over up to 4 years). With support from the three main agencies in Scotland I am keen to develop such a research proposal and will be entering the internal competition (within the University) shortly. I am keen to develop a strong link\/cooperation with the Tyndall Centre and I would like to explore ways in which this might be achieved.

{"text":"Klez: The Virus That Won't Die Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc. Andrew Brandt >>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002 The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC. Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific virus ever. And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry other viruses in them that corrupt your data. ... _______________________________________________ Irregulars mailing list Irregulars@tb.tf","label":0}

Here is a letter from one of them. Check out what he says about the Democrats and Republicans not caring about the troops, that is a widely held belief amongst the military, and they are coming to us in larger numbers than ever before. Reprinted with permission from one of our Brothers in the Marine Corps: Hey Commander, I know you have one busy schedule then to take time out of your day to read these messages. I have loved the NSM since I was in high school (I joined NSM yahoo group and spoke with the Sgt. in xxxxxxxxxx). I wish you well in the efforts to make a white America, I truly do. As for me I am going back to Iraq for another tour of duty. I want to ask you very seriously and very personally. If you see me (editted out xxxxx) ever killed over there, I want to make sure that America sees that the NSM cares all for its soldiers. You ARE THE ONLY WHITE Party we have left. You fight for our rights here, I fight for them on foreign soil. I am 19 years old, I love the USA, and I love white nations\/people. If you have any time my phone number is (xxxxxx edit) I would like to tell you voice to voice that I want you to succeed here in the battle for the USA. John Taylor Bowles is a noble man and I wish him the best. This website was great to learn and navigate my way to my heritage here. As things are, my job in the Corps is Infantry. I did 1 tour of duty, and I lost most of my platoonmates. I am going back and if I come home with a Flag over me I want the NSM to remember its warriors. I want to be a part of the NSM and I will in this life or the next. I want our unity to be profounded and the NSM to show how much they care for the soldiers and the Democrats and Republicans just DON'T care for the soldiers anymore. Corporate Greed has taken them away, Im fighting a war for oil and land in Iraq. But I love my white lands\/ancestry and people. I hope you can accomodate my request. Death Before Dishonour.

{"text":"We should NOT add that extra point you suggested. We want to emphasize the opposite, which is that we set up these committees with both campaigns early - albeit it one of the campaigns hasn't used theirs - precisely because we need to raise the resources NOW to have the infrastructure in place for the general election. The money the state parties are transferring back to the DNC is still helping the state parties. Point them to this bullet in the talking points: * It's important to note, the funds that the DNC and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping us build infrastructure for the general election. [SigDems] Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 - MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC From: Walker, Eric Sent: Monday, April 25, 2016 3:44 PM To: Graham Wilson; Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Lindsey Reynolds; Dillon, Lauren; Dacey, Amy; Bauer, R Subject: RE: FLAG: Politico asking state parties about HRC JFA direct transfers back to DNC Messages coming in from lots of state parties now. He's asking about FEC reports that show transfers from state parties to the DNC of exact dollar amounts raised by the HFA \/ state party JFAs. So in other words, let's say HFA raised 300k for PA Dems... PA Dems sending that money back to DNC. I assume he wants to write that this money won't be used for state parties or downballot races, but that it's all going to the DNC for the presidential campaign, and the state party JFAs are a workaround. I can call Josh and Zac with HFA and see what they're thinking. From: Wilson, Graham M. (Perkins Coie) Sent: Monday, April 25, 2016 3:31 PM To: Walker, Eric; Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Lindsey Reynolds; Dillon, Lauren; Dacey, Amy; Bauer, R Subject: RE: FLAG: Politico asking state parties about HRC JFA direct transfers back to DNC Which direct transfers is he asking about? Do we know HFA is saying? Graham M. Wilson | Perkins Coie LLP Direct. +1.202.434.1638 From: Walker, Eric Sent: Monday, April 25, 2016 3:18 PM To: Miranda, Luis; Paustenbach, Mark; Lindsey Reynolds; Dillon, Lauren; Dacey, Amy; Wilson, Graham M. (Perkins Coie); Bauer, Bob (Perkins Coie) Subject: FLAG: Politico asking state parties about HRC JFA direct transfers back to DNC PA Dems and OH Dems just got a call about it from Politico. Reporter wants to know why the direct transfers have been happening for exact dollar amounts. He wants to write the Paul Blumenthal angl e, but Politico can be more aggressive and sensational. I can supply the TPs that we've used before which nibble around the issue (JFA money goes to winning races up and down the ballot, investing in infrastructure, blah blah blah) but I think it may be worth adding an extra talking point if pressed. * It's way too early to start determining where the money will be most useful in the run-up to the election, and even if it was time to make that determination, we wouldn't discuss funding allocations in the press for the RNC to see what we're doing. Any objections? TPs we've used before: - For Background Only - Talking Points on Joint Fundraising Committees We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties. Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs. It's important to note, the funds that the DNC and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping us build infrastructure for the general election. These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. And let's be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising. Rick Hasen, an influential academic on campaign finance, posted an analysis on the Election Law Blog that addressed this issue. Hasen states in the article that \"it is hard to see what provision of the law\" is at issue in the letter. As the blog points out, \"legally\" the criticism of the fund \"seems weak.\"  Eric Walker walkere@dnc.org 732-991-1489 @ericmwalker ________________________________ NOTICE: This communication may contain privileged or other confidential information.

{"text":"---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Jose Maria Font Ca\u00f1ameras Date: May 26, 2008 3:00 AM Subject: membership in the NSM info To: commander@newsaxon.org Dear Commander Schoep, I have been reading about the National Socialist fight of the NSM to preserve Our Race from the threat of extinction and to defend the future for White children. I am a White Aryan European and here in Spain the situation is pretty much the same that you are facing in America. Being a fervent admirer of Commander Rockwell and sharing his worldview, I think that maybe I might become a member of the NSM, even if I'm not a native born American. I have a copy of the membership application, but the address it shows is the old one in Minnesota, and I understand that the HQ has moved to Detroit. Where should I send it? I am also not sure whether to choose the Storm Troopers option or the P.O. Of course, if I could, I would choose the SS, as I have always admired the structure, efficiency and loyalty of the Black Order, as well as the great character of one the best NS fighters, Reinhard Heydrich. But I supose that living in Barcelona, Spain, my options are somewhat limited at the moment, although I plan to visit the States in the near future so that, maybe, we'll be able to meet in person. Thank you in advance for your time and advice. Heil Hitler! signed Jose M. Font Ca\u00f1ameras Barcelona, Spain PS.

{"text":"---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Larry Wingers Date: May 13, 2008 5:26 PM Subject: National Socialism and Adolf Hitler To: commander@newsaxon.org Cc: lwingers@wi.rr.com Dear Jeff, I have some questions I hope you can answer for me. (I'm not sending this e-mail to make you angry or upset you just to get a better understanding.) Let me get my questions: 1.) I hear much about \"our\" White race \"dying\" or disappearing is this true? If so what stats do you have suggesting this? 2.) Why do you wear the Brown shirts of the SA when Hitler disbanned the SA? Why not black the color of the SS? 3.) I myself have many sympathies for Adolf Hitler I understand he is your \"official leader\" but why do you respect him after saying such things as - \"How fortunate for leaders that men do not think.\" Does this quote not sound like he is in essence trying to \"slide something under the rug\" by saying that if you lie to the people you can get away with pretty much anything? If i'm wrong I would appreciate it if you would correct me. : ) 4.) What do you think about the black race? Do you view that the White race is superior to them? If so why? Do you believe that they should live in the U.S.? 5.) If we are indeed superior to every other race, what kinds of things make \"us\" (The White Race) superior? 6.) I also see the word \"Nature\" used with a capital \"N\" what is this \"Nature?\" 7.) I already know your stance on interacial marriage but, why is it that it is bad? (Do not dogs interbreed and you get different breeds.) What is different about this and the human race? 8.) Is our race truly in that much danger that we should not \"interbreed?\" What is it about this that is so important? 9.) Did Hitler believe that the White race\/German race should not breed with Jews\/Blacks more importantly? Jeff I hope I'm not asking you too much too quickly and I would greatly appreciate it if you could return my e-mail.

We originally had SMURFS 3 in September (9\/10) but it has since moved back to 2016 \u2026.so it's a possibility for HOTEL T 2 to come up to September\u2026.but the key issue is school holiday timing.....& to capture them\u2026 we'd have to go out ideally two weeks prior (Sept 10) to the USA (Sept 25). McDonalds usually asks for a decent enough lead-time to sell-in & promote. Our 2 week holidays commence on Sept 18 in the three main states of NSW\/VIC\/QLD and in the other states on the 25th Sept. Competition is Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children on Sept 10 and Dreamworks' Bureau Of Other Worldly Operations on Sept 17. We would not want to date against the latter\u2026and Sept. 24 is too late to do the business we need. There is about $40mil+ available of B.O. for family films during the Sept holidays\u2026noting they are only a short 2 week duration\u2026whilst equally\u2026the lead into Christmas is also a very good & long less intense holiday trading period ! \u00c2 Original Hotel T did $12.1mil. Approx $9.05mil (2D) and $3.05mil (3D) on 454 prints. We released on Sept 20, 2012 a week after Madagascar 3 which took over $22mil and Diary Of A Wimpy Kid (also Sept 20) which took about $8mil. \u00c2 Hotel T 2 \u2013 November 26, 2015 Competition: Hunger Games \u2013 Mockingjay Nov 19 Bond 24 \u2013 Nov 19 Hotel T 2 \u2013 Nov 26 Untitled Comedy Warner\/Roadshow - Dec 10 Seth Rogen Christmas Movie \u2013 Dec 10 Star Wars 7 \u2013 Dec 17 Kung Fu Panda 3 \u2013 Dec 26 Peanuts \u2013 Jan 1 The Good Dinosaur \u2013 Jan 1 \u00c2 \u00c2 Think we need to know how real\/definite the McDonalds tie-in is before proposing any change..which would require approval from all to go earlier than Domestic. \u00c2 Cheers \u00c2 Stephen Basil-Jones Executive Vice President - Aust.\/N.Z. & Northern Asia SONY PICTURES RELEASING PTY LTD Level 26, 1 Market St, Sydney NSW 2000 T: + 612 9272 2902 E: stephen_basil-jones@spe.sony.com \u00c2 \u00c2 From: Clark, Nigel Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2014 5:50 AM To: Basil-Jones, Stephen; Saturnino, Rodrigo; Brune, Eric; Bachmann, Martin; nicola maccanico; Alexander, Philip; Sirenko, Anton; Losada, Ivan; Taylor, Peter Cc: Blake, Jeff; Bruer, Rory; ODell, Steven; Alexander, Ralph; Bruno, Steve; Braddel, Mark; Tamburini, Vittorio Subject: FW: HOTEL T 2 -- connecting SPA with the territory teams \u00c2 To: Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain, UK \u00c2 Dear All, \u00c2 Please find below an email from Jeffrey Varanini from Sony Pictures Animation. Jeffrey works closely with Bob and Michelle in the area of Business and Franchise Development. \u00c2 As you will read from his email, Jeffrey is keen to speak directly with the top performing markets on 'Hotel T', to talk about opportunities to take 'Hotel T 2' to even greater success. With SPA being part of Sony, it's always a little difficult to stand in the way of this direct contact. \u00c2 Please be aware that I will be sharing your contact information with Jeffrey, so please expect an introductory email in the first instance, to be followed up by a call. I would urge you to reacquaint yourselves with your plans and strategy for 'Hotel T' ahead of the call, and you should feel free to include any relevant members of your marketing and distribution team on the call. \u00c2 Finally, it would be greatly appreciated if you would drop HO a brief summary of how the call went, what was discussed, and any next steps. No need to 'reply all' but please be sure send your recap to me, with c.c. to Jeff, Rory, Steven and your distribution supervisor. I will forward on to the HO marketing group. \u00c2 Thanks and regards, Nigel \u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 From: Varanini, Jeffrey Sent: Tuesday, June 24, 2014 10:29 AM To: Clark, Nigel Cc: Chaires, Becky (Imageworks) Subject: HOTEL T 2 -- connecting with the territory teams \u00c2 Nigel, \u00c2 Just wanted to thank you again for the time last week. We really appreciate all of your support and want to be a great partner in helping you take HOTEL T 2 to the next level. \u00c2 As I mentioned, I'd like to connect with the teams in the territories where HOTEL 1 performed particularly well. To ground us, I'll ask questions about the strategy the last time around, what performed well, what's evolved locally since then and where they think the opportunities may be this time. Is there someone on your team I should work with to start this process? \u00c2 Thanks again & Best, \u00c2 Jeffrey Varanini Business & Franchise Development Sony Pictures Digital Productions Tel: 310-840-8378 Email: jeffrey_varanini@spe.sony.com \u00c2 Attachments: image002.jpg (15610 Bytes)","label":0}

Trump leads Clinton overall, 42.3 percent to 41.4 percent - well within the 4.1 margin of error. Clinton leads Trump among independents, and the undecided Republican voters are nearly double those in the Democratic column. And the gender split is on full display: Trump leads among men, Clinton among women. FYI, Landmark and Rosetta Stone are considered Republican-oriented firms Bernie Sanders How Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party The math is against Bernie Sanders in his fight for the White House. But the Vermont senator is poised to leave behind a durable legacy: A generation of liberal voters enthralled by his populist message -- and a Democratic Party whose ideological center has shifted left during the 2016 election. The effort now is to make sure things stay that way. Sanders has vowed to take his campaign to the Democratic convention, but he's also signaled that his effort is now more of a movement than a competitive political machine. He's slashed staff and slowed down his breakneck pace of campaigning. Republican Party Candidates Donald Trump Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton 'enabler' attack justified Donald Trump said Monday he called Hillary Clinton an \"enabler\" of her husband's infidelity as \"retribution\" for her playing the \"woman's card\" against him. \"It's only retribution for what she said. She is playing the woman's card to the hilt,\" Trump told CNN's Chris Cuomo in a testy exchange on \"New Day.\" \"She is going, I watched over the weekend, everything is about 'woman' and 'Donald Trump raised his voice.' And you know it's all nonsense. You know what? Women understand it better than anybody.\" Trump accused Clinton at a recent campaign stop of attacking the women who accused Bill Clinton of harassing them.

Keith At 13:26 12\/01\/2005, you wrote: Hi Keith, I am in transit back to Bergen where there is a strong storm at present, but just a query to ask what you think a a realistic time fframe for your part. I will be reding through it on the way. If you have problems getting the references in, this is something we can help with, if you just write i text author name, year and paper, then we download from the ISI base and enter into End Note here, just to help you prioritising the text and figures. Thanks for all your efforts. This is a critical part of the Chapter and the most complex and it seems to progress well, despite the strains. Cheers, Eystein Basically , I need to send this to you to because there comes a point when I am just not able to read it objectively. I would really like you both - and David and Stefan (I am ccing to them only) to look at it . Obviously it has grown too much, but the information in here is in my opinion all important. I suggest removing the regional simulations stuff from the end (as David said earlier!) but feel this should be somewhere - also (sorry Eystein) perhaps the ocean section should go? I have dropped the proposed Figure 2 _ after wasting a lot of time on it - there are too many problems with getting and understanding data - and then making any sensible conclusion on the basis of it. We really must have the two Figures left though - or some variants (these need borehole curves including and some way of indicating envelope of uncertainty around all reconstructions - perhaps as gray shading of different darkness depending on how may confidence limits overlap). I would really appreciate a dispassionate look by all of you at the conclusions drawn after the the desciption of both Figures - in the light of the discussion we had about interpreting these Figures. I am really happy if you and David and Stefan (and Fortunat?) consider what is worth and not worth trying to say re the implications of these Figures, beyond the TAR. I can not tell if what I am saying is balanced (I know Esper reconstruction is very hairy and ECHO-G run has much too great long-term variability - but no evidence PUBLISHED to support this - yet at least). Is what I say about the implications of the reconstructions banal? I have been battling with teaching today and fucked up course scheduling by the administration that has outraged some students. Tomorrow I must take daughter back for new term in Cambridge - and now must work on proposal for Russian who leaves Thursday and needs to submit before then. Do have a look and trim , cross reference as needed. The nightmare with these references continues also and I will have to get someone to help out here - incidentally our secretary has gone absent for a month . I will be back in hopefully by tomorrow afternoon . The conclusions (bullets?) should be very brief - but can not see them yet - suggestions welcome I can try to do something for the methods but would rather you just told me exactly what is needed. I will then work on this Thursday and likely happy to accept what you say re this text. I know I have not contributed to the discussing on other sections - very frustrating - but must wait til after ZOD .

What you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the \"Price-Feature Ratio Analysis.\" Featured products can fall in to three stages of Price-Feature ratios: Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one. Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability in prices among products with similar features. It pays to comparison shop for the best price. Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much from merchant to merchant.

DNC Chair, Jewish Community Leaders Denounce Anti-Semitic Vitriol Against Jewish Reporters in 2016 campaign Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz joined with Jewish community leaders from the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and Bend the Arc to denounce anti-Semitic vitriol against Jewish reporters in the 2016 campaign. Throughout the 2016 campaign, journalists reporting on Donald Trump's candidacy have been met with hatred and vitriol inspired by the Republican nominee. In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported on Trump's inspiring of white supremacists in a story titled: \"White Nationalists See Advancement Through Donald Trump's Candidacy .\" Whether it's Trump's campaign manager assaulting a female reporter, or Donald Trump commanding the crowd to direct their anger towards the press during his rallies, it's clear Trump's supporters derive this kind of violent behavior and extreme rhetoric towards the press from the man standing behind the podium. Furthermore, the Trump camp has shown no remorse or sympathy for reporters who are subjected to abuse by Trump supporters. When GQ reporter Julia Ioffe received hateful messages in response to a profile she penned about Melania Trump, Ms. Trump blamed the reporter, saying she \"provoked \" the anti-Semitic abuse. Mr. Trump declined to denounce the followers who flooded that reporter with invective, saying he had \"no message,\" for them. According to Politico, Jewish leaders on both sides of the aisle were dismayed by Trump's refusal to combat Yesterday, Robert Kagan wrote this in the Washington Post about the fascist threat posed by Trump's candidacy : \"A mass political movement is thus a powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses.\" Predictably, when Jonathan Weisman of the New York Times, tweeted out a passage from that op-ed, he was treated to similar anti-Semitic abuse from Trump supporters. This is unacceptable. Until Trump makes a forceful denouncement of the anti-Semitic vitriol his supporters have directed at Jews and Jewish reporters, he is condoning his followers' comments.

Meanwhile, in somewhat of a surprise, Johnny Knoxville's hidden-camera prank flick \"Bad Grandpa\" was the weekend's runner-up after debuting at No. 1. \"Last Vegas,\" starring Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Kevin Kline and Michael Douglas, came in just ahead of the animated \"Free Birds\" with $16.5 million -- a healthy start given its modest $28-million budget. \"Free Birds,\" which cost $55 million to make, opened with $16.2 million.

{"text":"It's been a disastrous week for the GOP. Now that Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both dropped out of the race, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Problems for Republicans extend far beyond the Cleveland convention, which many top GOP leaders have already vowed to avoid. With Trump as their nominee, any remaining hope Republicans had of concealing their true colors is gone. Party leaders shouldn't be surprised though - this was a crisis of their own making. For years, the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. Now they're stuck with the most reckless, dangerous and divisive nominee in modern history. In every primary contest, Republican voters continue to report in exit polls that their primary has been divisive - in some cases, more than half report they feel betrayed by their own party. Meanwhile, in poll after poll, Democratic voters are reporting that our primary has energized the party and that they're enthusiastic about our candidates. It's clear that the enthusiasm gap favors Democrats. From now until Election Day in November, Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his offensive rhetoric and dangerous ideas. We're fighting for the American people, and for the values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity for all. Looking to our convention in Philadelphia, we will not only emerge united, but we will nominate the next President of the United States. Supreme Court Vacancy It's been 51 days of Republican obstruction since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, passing the average amount of time it takes the Senate to hold a hearing on a nominee. While Republicans continue to avoid doing their jobs, Senators like Chuck Grassley have admitted it would be a \"gamble\" to allow Trump to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. And the American public agrees: 62% of voters don't trust Trump to nominate a new Supreme Court justice. If Americans agree that Donald Trump lacks the judgement to nominate a Supreme Court justice, when will the GOP? Job well done, Senator McConnell . The Campaign Trail Trump clinched his party's nomination, but something's not quite right... Will any former GOP nominees or presidents endorse Trump ? So far, it's looking pretty bleak. Mitt Romney, John McCain and the former Bush Presidents still have yet to throw their support behind Trump. But things got especially awkward when Paul Ryan, the highest ranking House Republican and chair of the Republican National Convention, said that he cannot endorse Trump. But Ryan, with his fellow Republicans, paved the way for Trump. From flip-flopping on campaign funding to calling the National Enquirer \"professionals ,\" Trump also reminded us this week that he's about as knowledgeable about foreign policy as Sarah Palin, and all he knows is what's on the internet . WATCH Even the former Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates took to the airwaves to question Trump's grasp of foreign policy, saying Trump is someone \"who doesn't understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers.\" Gates' comments are a reminder that Trump clearly lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. The New York Times described what Trump's first 100 days as president would look like, noting, \"many Americans are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office.\" Here is a brief summary : [tweeet-30","label":0}

For example, what I sent them included: The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it's not her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms about both of our candidates and the substantive campaigns they've run . As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings overall this year than they did in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both campaigns to agree, we added four. The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for several cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 \u2013 when Obama beat Clinton --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged \"super\" delegates, now down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules. The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participation of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that lays out the facts on Super Delegates . It also debunks the false myths about Iowa. The DNC's delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any of these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for several cycles \u2013 including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton. There's just no evidence that the process has been rigged. It certainly wasn't rigged in Nevada this weekend, which was not a DNC event but a state party one.

Bernie Sanders faces a 'then what' problem 05\/19\/16 08:53 AM\u2014UPDATED 05\/19\/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It's safe to say May hasn't gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders' supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny . Sanders' candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn't exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it's no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn't backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July \u2013 or even wrest the nomination from her. It's at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a \"then what?\" problem. According to the Times' piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have \"a psychological impact\" on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there's no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There's still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, \"We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention's agenda.\" OK, but then what? It's not clear how, exactly, one puts \"socialism\" on the \"agenda,\" but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post's Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees' membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders'] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party's rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It's worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility \u2013 steps the DNC wouldn't have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There's still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he's not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party's ticket and elect President Trump. What's less clear is what he'll demand in exchange for his supp","label":0}

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java\/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the following: - Classes for creating \"Named Objects\", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for \"Named Objects\". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on \"Named Objects\". - Current types of \"Named Objects\" include: NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication Framework AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using digital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to contain: - Core: hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level NameSpaces - Signing Services: Implementation of web based signing services End user hosted signing service - Example User Authentication Application - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.

My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my father's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail exchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news came hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news: \"Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of a heart attack at home.\" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like a beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a few months ago: \"I evangelized for months last year for having our company at the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite being postponed by 9\/11, and having to move the venue at the last minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis. It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.\" I returned from speaking to another user group the other night and found that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered. Sweet!

No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please look again). A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In fact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use Dreamweaver. Which reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly newsletter.

GnomeWILDCARD Full PDF Books Poor Richard's Web Internet Promotions E-Mail Publishing Web Site Makeover Websites Made Easy Online Communities Home Networking Internet Recruiting Online Branding The Evidence is Against You Scribbled by Jim Girard Every time some new technology has expanded free access to popular music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the 1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed by the music industry as different from previous such developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD technology). The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect - and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA, and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win - and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent). The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it, you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like \"Coke\" or \"Kleenex\" as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some point could start using the word on their own product, arguing that it is in the public domain. The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they know from long experience, increases their sales because most of the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright, in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain. The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it requires charging far more for an individual song that most people are willing to pay. At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a simple moral or criminal issue. \"Common sense\" tells a lot of people that copying music without paying for it is just like stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't be paying him as much as he is. Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It! A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about networking?

I receive my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article.

Right-click, copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM), then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand; %3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark. The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which translastes into a '&' symbol.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement today in recognition of May as Jewish American Heritage Month. As a Congresswoman, Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz was instrumental in establishing May as Jewish American Heritage Month. President George W. Bush first proclaimed JAHM almost in 2006 and it has been celebrated ever since: \"This month, we celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month by marking the important contributions that Jews have made to American life throughout U.S. history. \"From a young age, my parents taught me that a central tenet of our faith is tikkun olam - repairing the world. As active citizens and as Jews, they helped me understand that we have a responsibility to advocate for others and on behalf of justice and righteousness. \"This year's JAHM theme - Jewish contributions to education - builds upon that legacy of tikkun olam. We know that education can be the key for parents who want to give their children a better life or a chance to escape the cycle of poverty. Education is also our best defense against bigotry and ignorance in society. Jewish Americans have made major contributions to the American education system, most notably Julius Rosenwald's effort to help build more than 5,000 schools in the American South. By fighting for a better education for all Americans, Jewish Americans can do our part to repair our country and the world. \"There's a reason why two-thirds of Jews identify with the Democratic Party: because the Democratic Party's values are in sync with the values of the Jewish community, like tzedakah, or charity, gemilut hasadim, the gift of loving kindness, and the cause of social justice. This Jewish American Heritage Month, I'm proud to call myself a Democrat because I know that we are not only advancing the causes of our party but of the Jewish people.\" Eric Walker walkere@dnc.org 732-991-1489 @ericmwalker","label":0}

Body: From the New York Times : That evening of public abasement, rather than sending Mr. Trump away, accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world. And it captured the degree to which Mr. Trump's campaign is driven by a deep yearning sometimes obscured by his bluster and bragging: a desire to be taken seriously. So in addition to rescuing the U.S. economy, rescuing and the auto industry, creating over 14 million new jobs, getting unemployment to under 5%, getting making providing health coverage accessible to 20 million previously uninsured Americans while slowing the growth of health costs, killing Osama Bin Laden and taking out key ISIS leaders, 30,000 other terrorists, President Obama may have led the Republican Party to having to own the results of years of their ugly and divisive politics. a Democratic successor And he did it using nothing but his comedic chops.

Trump has for years proven himself to be a loose cannon whose hateful language and dangerous policies will do serious harm to working families and put America's security at risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a President Trump would be too big a risk. Read the growing list of Republicans and conservatives unwilling to support a President Donald Trump and fresh condemnations of Trump: Eliot Cohen, Counselor to U.S. Department of State under President George W. Bush : \"Mr. Trump's temperament, his proclivity for insult and deceit and his advocacy of unpredictability would make him a presidential disaster \u2014 especially in the conduct of foreign policy, where clarity and consistency matter.\" Jeb Bush:   \"First, not all Hispanics are Mexican\u2026 Secondly, not all Hispanics eat tacos. Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things he already said, is a further insult. It's like eating a watermelon and saying 'I love African-Americans.'\u2026 If we lose in November, we Republicans have ourselves to blame.\" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen [R-FL]: On supporting Donald Trump: \"No, I'm not. And who would have ever thought when I did that interview that talking about having a transgender son would be more comfortable than saying I'm not going to support my Republican party nominee?\" Rep. Reid Ribble [R-WI]: \"Ribble...remains deeply opposed to Donald Trump while his party begins to rally around him. \"It's an unrecoverable relationship, let me put it that way,\" Ribble says of his attitude toward the New York developer, a candidate he says lacks the temperament to be president.\" Ken Cobb, Chair Beltrami County, Minnesota Republicans: \"Speaking on my behalf ... I am concerned about our presumptive nominee, that he is at odds with the principles that make our party what it is,\" Cobb said. \"I'm concerned that he will do considerable damage just by association to our candidates who are conservatives.\" John Weaver, former Chief Strategist for John Kasich: \"I think a combination of his rhetoric, his inability to bring people together, which is what you have to do in swing stages like Michigan, ... are going to put Michigan out of reach for him.\" Minnesota State GOP Convention Delegate Walter Hudson: \"We want to send a clear message that Republicans in Minnesota categorically reject the divisive candidacy of Donald Trump.\" ### For Immediate Release, May 18, 2016 Contact: press@hillaryclinton.com PAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA Contributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.

Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding Donald Trump's ongoing comments about Governor Perry and border security: 'Donald Trump continues to demonstrate his fundamental misunderstanding of border security. Make no mistake \u2013 border security is a federal responsibility, but when I met with President Obama last year and it became clear he would not act, I told him if he would not secure the border, Texas would. Rather than thanking Texas for stepping into a gap it shouldn't have to fill, Mr. Trump has made clear that he believes the states should fend for themselves on border security. Not only is this wrong, it perpetuates the same failed policies that have left our southern border porous and vulnerable. I have a message for my fellow Republicans and the independents who will be voting in the primary process: what Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism, it is Trump-ism \u2013 a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.\" [Perry for President, 7\/16\/15 ] Perry Said Donald Trump's Rhetoric Was \"Damaging To Our Party, And Most Important, Damaging To The United States Of America.\" \"And I've been honest about our party's shortcomings \u2014 including my own \u2014 in engaging all Americans in our conversations about the future of this nation. But we can't do that if we're pitting black against white against brown; rich against poor; women against men. Playing identity politics takes a page right out of the Democrats' playbook, and we Republicans are better than that.That's why rhetoric such as the kind employed by Donald Trump is damaging \u2014 it's damaging to our party, and most important, damaging to the United States of America. I believe strongly that Mr. Trump's philosophy is not conservatism, but rather a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.\" [Rick Perry, National Review, 7\/20\/15 ] Perry: Trump Does Not \"Represent The Republican Party That I Represent.\" \"PERRY: ... competent -- well, listen, he doesn't reflect the Republican Party from my position. I mean, when he said what he said about immigrants in this country and used very inflammatory language, when he said what he said about veterans in this country and people who have gotten captured -- I don't know about anybody else. I'll speak for myself. He didn't represent the Republican Party that I represent.\" [Hannity, Fox News, 7\/20\/15] RICK PERRY HAS CALLED DONALD TRUMP \"UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF Perry Had \"No Confidence\" That Donald Trump Could Adeptly Lead The Armed Forces. \"As a veteran and the son of a veteran, I find Mr. Trump's brand of vitriol particularly offensive, and I have no confidence that he could adeptly lead our nation's armed forces. His comments over the weekend should completely and immediately disqualify him from seeking our nation's highest office.\" [Rick Perry, National Review, 7\/20\/15 ] Perry: Donald Trump's Comments On Veterans \"Make Him Unfit To Be Commander-In-Chief.\" \"Donald Trump should apologize immediately for attacking Senator McCain and all veterans who have protected and served our country. As a veteran and an American, I respect Sen. McCain because he volunteered to serve his country. I cannot say the same of Mr. Trump. His comments have reached a new low in American politics. His attack on veterans make him unfit to be Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, and he should immediately withdraw from the race for President.\" [Perry for President, Press Release, 7\/18\/15 ] Perry Said Trump's Comments About John McCain's War Record Were Past Offensive To \"Those Of Us Who Have Worn The Uniform Of This Country.\" \"PERRY: But I want to go back to this issue about saying that John McCain is not a war hero and that he doesn't like to be around people who were captured. That is offensive. I mean, it's past offensive, Sean, to those of us who have worn the uniform of this country. Sam Johnson, who I served in the Texas legislature with, spent over seven years in that POW camp. To offend those individuals -- but to offend their families and to offend those that went through this period of time, it's just -- from my perspective, Donald Trump does not have the character, nor does he have the temperament to be the commander-in-chief of our military forces. I'm just stunned.\" [Hannity, Fox News, 7\/20\/15] Perry: Donald Trump's \"Absurdity Reached A New Low\" When He Insulted Sen. John McCain. \"Mr. Trump's absurdity reached a new low over the weekend, when he spit in the eye of every American prisoner of war, particularly Senator John McCain. But frankly, we should expect no better from a man who couldn't be bothered to answer the call to serve his nation when it needed him most.\" [Rick Perry, National Review, 7\/20\/15 ]","label":0}

The December contract dipped $0.02 to $2.602 per MMBtu. Prices opened sharply lower, but managed to stage an erratic rally to finish near the highs of the day. The mild weather and diminishing storage availability continue to pressure a weak cash market which in turns is dragging down futures prices. As storage becomes less available more expensive, the differential between cash and futures could continue to widen. Early injection estimates for tomorrows weekly AGA storage report range between 75 Bcf to 85 Bcf. For the same week last year, stocks rose 78 Bcf, and on average over the last 5 years, stocks have gained about 70 Bcf. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports last week's tally of 39 Heating Degree Days was 11 above normal, but 5 less than forecast and 5 below the same week a year ago. NOAA said it expected 44 HDDs this week, or 6 above normal. In terms of cooling degree days, NOAA said last week's tally of 18 was 13 less than the previous week, 7 below normal and 2 less than the same week a year ago. NOAA has forecast 13 CDDs this week, which is 6 below normal. The latest NWS forecast calls for normal temperatures for most of the nation, except for parts of the Midwest, Northeast and South Texas which will be below normal. Manufacturing activity, which consumes about 45% of all natural gas use, contracted for a 14th straight month in September but showed signs of improvement. The National Association of Purchasing Management monthly index dipped only slightly in September, slipping to 47.0 in its worst slump since the 1990-1991 recession. A reading under 50 indicates that manufacturing activity, about one-sixth of the overall economy, is declining. The NAPM index has now held below that level since August 2000, but has been steadily improving from January's 10-year low of 41.2. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally off $0.05 $0.10 yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.05 to $1.77 per MMBtu. ------------------------------------------------------------- RISK MANAGEMENT Across the Energy Enterprise e-Acumen, Inc., is uniquely positioned to help you manage risk and increase value.

The panel suggested that if all the shareholders were willing to absorb the costs, the tariff on Dabhol's power could be reduced. The panel has also proposed that Enron, GE and Bechtel absorb a huge loss on their investment in the project. After a acrimonious dispute with the local utility, Enron had said it would like to abandon the project. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which had initially contracted to purchase all the power from Dabhol plant, subsequently defaulted on payments because it didn't need that much power and claimed it was too expensive. Enron claimed the utility was in violation of its contractual obligations. Dabhol took the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration in London, but Enron has said it would settle out of court if it could recover its costs. -------------------------------------------------------- Ziff Energy Group presents the North American Gas Strategies Conference November 5 7 Calgary The Future of Western Canada's Gas Supply: Stretched to the Limit? & e-Solutions: Next Generation Concepts for the E&P Sector Join us for frank, in-depth discussion on the future of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.

A consortium of oil companies last week released a gloomy report on the project's economics. BP, Phillips Petroleum and Exxon Mobil unveiled a preliminary study on the project last week that showed smaller investment returns than previously estimated. The project is uneconomical at this point, but despite the study the project has not been shelved. The consortium will likely make a decision on the project by the and of the year. Depending on the route, it may cost between $15 billion and $17 billion. The 2000-mile southern route parallels the TAPS to Fairbanks, then turns to follow the Alaska Highway through the Yukon Territory and British Columbia, connecting with existing pipelines in Alberta. The 1,650-mile northern route runs east from the North Slope to the Mackenzie River delta, then south along the Mackenzie valley into Alberta. It would be cheaper, but would have to cross the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold a hearing today on legislation that may be needed to move pipeline construction forward. The hearing will focus on ways the federal government can help improve project economics. The consortium has requested fast-track approval of FERC permits, but no direct federal subsidies for construction costs. The Bush administration says the project must be independently feasible and not rely on subsidies. Natural gas from Alaska could make up 10% of nations energy supplies by 2015, according to a study from the Interstate Natural Gas Supply Association of America. -------------------------------------------------------- ZIFF ENERGY GROUP: NEW INDEPENDENT STUDY NORTHERN GAS PROSPECTS and IMPACTS Ziff Energy Fundamental Analysis + Scenario Analysis utilizing GPCM Model This 160+ page comprehensive multi-client assessment focuses on the critical issues and challenges facing the commercialization of the Northern gas in Alaska and the Canadian Mackensie Delta area and the impact of this gas on the North American natural gas market. ?

The state is attempting to issue $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the general fund for $6.1 billion spent on buying power for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. The bond sale is being held up because state regulators have not approved the designation of a portion of the utilities rates to repay the bonds. Last month, the state sold $5.7 billion in revenue anticipation notes to boost the general fund and provide a buffer until the bonds can be sold. Since revenue anticipation notes must be repaid by the end of the fiscal year, California could issue revenue anticipation warrants to repay the notes if the bonds are not issued before. The state treasurer has warned that the states budget deficit could rise to $9.3 billion by the beginning of fiscal year 2003 if the bonds are not issued by then and state lawmakers would have to consider raising taxes or cutting spending. -------------------------------------------------------- YOU DESIGNED IT.

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor. I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15\" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM. Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next? Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on\/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead. If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful - I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas. Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

And, like so many of you, I've spent this primary observing the candidates and the parties, and what they represent. And I have to say, this has been a difficult period for the Republicans. They're trying to figure out what they're standing for -- whether they will be the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods, whether they will be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws. But the good news for Democrats is that we know what we believe. We believe that climate change is real and that we must do something about it. We believe in raising the minimum wage, and that women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job. We believe that our laws should reflect our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, no matter their race or religion, gender or sexual orientation. We have two fine Democratic candidates who, no matter their differences, share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party. And in November, we're going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president.

{"text":"HI Tim, Thanks for your message. Yes, you guys have us beat on the early monday end of things! Your points are all taken. I think we all agree there is much work left to be done, more than enough for all of us to continue to be involved in constructive collaboration, etc. Scott and I, for example, are almost done writing up the work based on your visit w\/ us last year, and will send the initial draft on to you, Keith, and the others involved in the near future. It will be a good chance to try to address a lot of these questions in an article of adequate length to discuss the nuances that unfortunately cannot be addressed in a shorter piece. I also appreciate your more detailed comments about the comparisons, etc. Your points are all reasonable ones. We can maintain an honest difference about how well those points were conveyed in the Science piece (for example, you can imagine how the statement in your piece \"This record has a smaller amplitude of century-to-century variability, and is consistently at or near the upper limit of alternate records produced by other researchers\" might indeed have been interpreted as setting MBH99 apart as, in your words, an \"outlier\"). We have good reason to believe that our reconstruction *will* in fact nderestimate extratropical temperature means but far less so full globe\/hemisphere-means prior to the 18th century because the basis functions that primarily set the extratropics apart from the full hemispheric patterns (e.g., NAO type patterns and other anomaly patterns largely carried by EOFs #2 and #3) start to drop out from our basis set prior to the 18th century, while the pattern that best resolves the full global and\/or hemispheric mean (with note from MBH98, particularly large loadings primarily in the tropics and subtropics) still remains. That is why we have never published an *extratropical* temperature reconstruction prior to the 18th century. I would be happy to discuss this point with you and Keith and others in more detail. Thus, I have compared Esper et al w\/ our records in the manner described in my previous email, which I think allows us to diagnose the extent to which differing high-latitude and full-hemispheric patterns may, at times, explain the somewhat modest differences between the records when similarly scaled to the full hemispheric 1856-1990 mean, and always, within the context of the diagnosed uncertainties. There is no guarentee, as you say, that the uncertainties are correct, but I personally believe they'll stand up over time. You can call me on this 10 years from now, and somebody will owe somebody a beer... In any case, I hope and fully expect we can all continue to all be engaged in constructive interaction & hopefully continued collaboration. It will require some sensitivity on all our part to the larger issues surrounding our work, and the way it gets presented to the broader community, but I don't think that should be all that difficult. I look forward to these more constructive interactions. I'll do my best to foster them, Mike At 01:57 PM 4\/15\/02 +0100, Tim Osborn wrote: Dear all, well, the time zone may let you have the last word before the weekend, but we can get the first word in on a Monday morning!

Mann wrote: In keeping w\/ the spirit of Tom's and Keith's emails, I wanted to stress, before we all break for the weekend, that this is ultimately about the science, its not personal. If my comments seemed to assail e.g. Keith's motives or integrity, etc. I believe that they were misunderstood (as I tried to clarify that in my previous message), but I can see that there was a potential for misunderstanding of my message (precision in wording is very important) given the high levels of sensitivity in this debate. So I wanted to leave no uncertainty about that. And of course, I very much apologize to Keith (and Tim) if they took them my comments that way. They, again, were most decidedly not intended that way. Thanks for clarifying that, Mike. I think that both Keith and I interpreted your earlier e-mail as being more critical of us than you actually meant it to be. Most issues surrounding the recent Esper et al. and Briffa & Osborn pieces seem to have been covered adequately already. There are just a couple of issues on which I'd like to add a few comments, hopefully clarifying the situation rather than opening up more avenues for debate. The first relates to the purpose and style of the Briffa & Osborn piece. Perspectives are brief, non-technical and not peer-reviewed. Our instructions were: \"The Perspective should provide an overview of recent research in the field and explain to the general reader why the work is particularly exciting.\" Is it any surprise then that we should focus on the new insights provided by the Esper et al. work, and that it suggests a different climate history than earlier work? And that the constraints of the perspectives format (in terms of length, audience and style) prevented us from listing ALL the caveats and uncertainties related to this and earlier reconstructions and that might be of relevance to their intercomparison? I don't think it is surprising, nor do I think we should be criticised for it. Moreover, despite the constraints of the perspectives format, I think we were very careful with our wording to avoid misleading the reader. The reference to the IPCC, for example, was not at all sloppy - the opposite, in fact, since it was very carefully worded: the IPCC Synthesis Report is referred to, rather than the full TAR, and it is quite true that there is a focus on the reconstruction of Mann et al. in the former. As Mike says, IPCC conclusions were based on other work too. But I'd guess that many of the readers of our perspective won't have read the full IPCC report, so we thought it valid to focus on the difference between the new work and that shown in the Synthesis Report (which more will have seen). To do this is certainly not unfair to the IPCC. It would only have been unfair if we had implied that the IPCC had ignored this new work - but of course we weren't doing that, because how could one expect the TAR to consider work that is published a year after the TAR itself? We were similarly careful with our wording in our brief mention of the MWP, by saying it is \"more pronounced\" in Esper et al. - this doesn't mean it is warmer than the others (and thus has no implications for the IPCC conclusion of recent unusual warmth), rather it is pronounced because it is followed by stronger cooling. The second issue is our re-calibration of the reconstructions. While it hasn't been explicitly stated, I get the impression that this is considered by some to be a poor thing to do. The particular re-calibration we do has a number of effects, including making the Mann et al. reconstruction appear more consistently at the top of the range of alternatives. But please let me assure you (Mike, Ray and Malcolm) that the reason for re-calibrating the records is definitely *not* to make your record appear as an outlier, and I hope you believe me. Indeed, in Jones, Osborn & Briffa (2001: Science 292, 662-667) we showed various NH records *without* applying our re-calibration. We produced our first comparison of records for an earlier Science perspectives piece in 1999 (Briffa & Osborn, 1999) and thought it would be useful to do a re-calibration to remove some of the reasons for inter-reconstruction differences (which can be due to: different proxy data, different statistical methods, different calibration target and different calibration period). The latter two reasons were removed by re-calibrating against a common target series and over a common period. We updated this in Briffa et al. (2001) and acknowledged that the target series (in terms of its spatial and seasonal definition) may not be optimal in all cases. Indeed, it may be especially sub-optimal for Mann et al., because their reconstruction approach combines the proxy records to optimally reconstruct full NH, annual mean T (whereas we have selected land north of 20N, warm-season T as our target for the recalibration). Despite this, we felt justified in doing the recalibration because the Mann et al. series still outperformed the others in terms of its correlation with the instrumental record over the calibration period! In our latest piece, we have updated the intercomparison in two ways (as well as including new series): (i) we took the spatially-resolved gridded reconstructions of Mann et al. and extracted only land boxes north of 20N; and (ii) we used annual, not warm-season, temperature as the target. The first of these (as explained by Keith and I in an earlier e-mail, which is repeated below because it didn't get sent to all of you firs time round) deals with all the points raised by Mike about tropical versus extratropical differences. I would again argue that we were not sloppy, because these changes to our intercomparison were carefully thought out. So that explains what we have done and why. There is some sensitivity, clearly, to calibration choices, which implies to me that the true uncertainty ranges are probably larger than those estimated solely from the statistical properties of calibration residuals (as used by Briffa et al., and [I think] by Mann et al.). There is clearly more progress to be made! Best regards to you all Tim ------------------------------------------ Date: Fri, 05 Apr 2002 17:17:55 +0100 To: \"Michael E.

I am happy to reserve my informal response until we are face to face! We did not respond earlier because we had more pressing tasks to deal with. This is not the place to go into a long or over-detailed response to all of your comments but a few brief remarks might help to clear up a couple of misconceptions. You consider our commentary on Ed and Jan's paper \"more flawed than even the paper itself\" on the basis that scaling the relationship between full Northern Hemisphere and extratropical Northern Hemisphere is *much* more problematic than even any of the seasonal issues we discuss. In fact we did not do this. The curve labelled Mann99 in our figure was, in fact, based on the average of only the land areas, north of 20 degrees N, extracted from your spatially-resolved reconstructions. We then scaled it by calibration against the instrumental annual temperatures from the same region. This is, just as you stress in your comments on the Esper et al. paper, what should have been done. We think that this single point addresses virtually of all your concerns. We can, of course, argue about what this means for the pre-1400 part of your reconstruction, when only 1 EOF was reconstructed, but the essential message is that we did our best to exclude the tropics (and the oceans too!) from your series so that it could more readily be compared with the other records. The fact that we have used only the extra-tropical land from your data is not clear from the text, so we can see why you may not have appreciated this, but we think you will concede that this fact negates much of what you say and that we acted \"more correctly\" than you realised. Blame *Science* for being so mean with their space allocation if you want! Remember that this was an unrefereed piece and we felt justified in concentrating on one issue; that of the importance of the method of scaling and its effect on apparent \"absolute\" reconstruction levels. In our draft, we went on to say that this was crucial for issues of simple model sensitivity studies and climate detection, citing the work of Tom Crowley and Myles Allen, but this fell foul of the editor's knife. You also express concerns about the calibration of Esper et al. (e.g., you say \"if the authors had instead used the actual (unsmoothed) instrumental record for the extratropical northern hemisphere to scale their record, their reconstruction would be much closer to MBH99\"). This point is wholly consistent with our discussion in the perspective piece, and indeed we show that in absolute terms the records are closer when Esper et al. is calibrated using unsmoothed data but since the variance is also reduced, the significance of the differences may be just as high. Finally, we have to say that we do not feel constrained in what we say to the media or write in the scientific or popular press, by what the sceptics will say or do with our results. We can only strive to do our best and address the issues honestly. Some \"sceptics\" have their own dishonest agenda - we have no doubt of that. If you believe that I, or Tim, have any other objective but to be open and honest about the uncertainties in the climate change debate, then I am disappointed in you also.

When I first joined the NSM I knew it would be something I would stick with the rest of my life. It was not a club, a gang, or some fleeting thrill for the moment: it was a commitment to a way of life, and a direct link to many of our Forefathers who fought for Blood and Soil. Fellow Party members, most of you have taken the Oath of Loyalty to the Party, and those that have not yet taken your Oath, as read in the membership handbook, are expected to do so as soon as possible. It is a commitment, and proves you are serious about helping us to bring about changes in our Nation. It also creates Solidarity, and Kinship with your fellow Brothers and Sisters in our struggle. In this modern day materialistic Society to some an Oath, or pledge of Loyalty means nothing. For those of us that live by the Old Ways, breaking an Oath defiles your Honor, and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that once held your life force. If a man cannot stay true to his Oath, then he is no man but rather a castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an Aryan Soul. Your Oath also holds you to the battlefield, until this fight for our Race and Nation has been won. Members of the SS swear Loyalty to the F\u00fchrer I often reflect about so-called Comrades that have abandoned their Oaths to the Party, and I wonder how they can live with themselves, as the rest of us face such a large scale enemy in Zog, and they give up without a fight, or before the fight is finished. We at Party HQ always hear a multitude of excuses from the Oath breakers. Sometimes their reasons are based in serious issues (still there is no reason serious enough to break your Oath) but more often than not it is trivial matters, such as personal problems with another member, so and so had their feelings hurt, or this or that person was not thanked enough for their work, or did not get promoted, or did not like a certain rule in the chain of command, or Religion, or insert excuse here ____. These same Oath breakers often claim to take great pride in the 3rd Reich, and CLAIM they are National Socialists. Truth be known, had they lived during the 3rd Reich and broke their Party Oaths there, especially in the war years, they might have met the hanging Judge Roland Freisler, and be dangling from piano wire! It comes down to this Comrades, and prospective Party members. If you are not serious about our Party leave now. I am opening the door now for any current member to leave, with their Oath intact. I want to shake out any of the uncommitted, non-serious members right now, considering they are not needed as we move forward to the frontlines. To the Prospects and Probate NSM members, this message is for you also. If you are not in this fight with us to the bitter end, now would be the time to walk away. Furthermore, the NSM does not operate as a Democracy: your pledge of Loyalty is to the Party and its Leadership. Honor your Oath, and your Pledge of Loyalty to the Party, or get out of our Ranks now while you still can! To the rest of you, the Party Faithful, the Warrior Archetypes, you men and women forged in Iron and steel ready to stand against the Zionist hordes, and their beloved illegal slave laborers: Your Party Salutes and Honors you!

In spirit, the men who fought at Valley Forge stand alongside of us, as do the brave men of the Alamo, as do the thousands that perished on the Eastern Front fighting Communism, and every other meaningful battle where our Racial Kinfolk have sacrificed their lives.

Over the last several weeks we have heard from the Commander regarding the subjects of honor, duty, our oaths, and the proper behavior of a Comrade. We are a National Socialist organization, not a democracy, nor a social club, not a collection of individuals, but a united force for our volk. A NS organization is run on the Fuhrerprizip, a concept brought to us from our ancestors--trust and obedience to your superiors, responsibly and service to those in your command. For too long some amongst us have forgotten that no one individual is important, as our Fuhrer instructs, but that we are all in service to our volk. I personally, and on behalf of my state of Wisconsin, support all decisions of our Commander, who acts to unify us all in service to the movement that is the only hope for our people. We have been through hard times before my Comrades, and will again many times before all is said and done. From experience, we know that the mud slinging will be fast and furious, pay no mind.

Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks -v1(EJB)-- Sender: Joe Biden Subject: You've been by Barack's and my side through so much, NAME. And if our time in office has been a lesson in anything, it's that there is no magic wand you can wave to make all the change you want to see happen overnight. Our system wasn't designed that way. The things worth doing - making health care affordable, acting on climate change, giving folks a shot to get ahead through education and jobs - take work. They take struggle and compromise. Governing isn't easy. What's easy is getting riled up, blaming the other side or scapegoating groups who don't have as loud a voice to fight back. The next six months won't be easy, NAME. They're going to require each and every one of us stepping up, not taking anything for granted, and working as hard as we ever have to elect Democrats this November. Walking away from all the hard work we've done over these past seven and a half years is unacceptable, plain and simple. The American people have worked too hard and come too far to go back the way Republicans would take us. We're not going to let that happen, but we need to make sure Democrats up and down the ballot all across the country have every resource they need to fight harder, work smarter, and win the day on November 8th. So if you can, NAME, pitch in $10 or more before our end-of-month deadline to help us get there: LINKS Thanks so much for playing your part here, NAME. I really mean it. Joe --v2(SK)-- Sender: Joe Biden Subject: For the next few months, you're gonna hear a whole lot about red states and blue states and purple states as the pundits try to predict how this election will play out. But here's the truth, NAME: We need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in every corner of the country on Election Day, and that means we can't take any state for granted. We've got to use every moment between now and November 8th to reach as many voters as we can -- from Maine to Hawaii. That means we need to get organized everywhere, right now. So I'm calling on you to help out the only folks who are committed to electing Democrats up and down the ballot in all 50 states by pitching in $10 or more before the DNC's end-of-May deadline. LINKS Thank you, NAME. I really appreciate your support. Joe -- v3 -- Sender: Joe Biden Subject: Three things Friend -- This election comes down to three simple things: 1. We've got to elect a Democratic president. We just have to -- because we've seen who the alternative is. 2. Because we know that no president can do everything alone, we have to get more Democrats in Congress who will work with them. And this year, we have a great opportunity to take back our majority in the Senate and make serious gains in the House. 3. There are so many important decisions that are being made in our statehouses, from funding for women's health services to protecting the rights of our LGBT neighbors. So we've got to elect Democratic governors and legislators in STATE and all across the country. NAME, the Democratic National Committee is the only official Democratic Party organization that is committed to all three -- to electing Democrats in every state at every level of office. So before the deadline at the end of this month, I'm asking you to support them with a donation of $10 or more. Can you step up? LINK Thanks, NAME.

Great explainer, including how trump's language is dog whistling From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 12:29 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Vox: trumps's trans position is incoherent Donald Trump's position on transgender rights is incoherent, not \"nuanced\" The Washington Post picked an interesting word to describe Donald Trump's new position on legal protections for transgender people: \"nuanced.\" A better word, however, might be \"incoherent.\" Trans people are \"a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the population,\" Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be left to the states, most of which he said would \"make the right decisions.\" So he would rescind the Obama administration's guidelines telling federally funded schools to respect the rights of trans people, including their right to use a bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. In other words, Trump thinks trans people should be protected by the law, but he wants to take away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in public schools. Pressed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old mantra of \"states' rights.\" As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sense if there's something local and state governments can do better than the federal government, or if it would be too burdensome or unwieldy for the federal government to get involved. A good example of that: fire departments. There's really no reason to think a federal fire department would be particularly more effective in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some exceptions may apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income areas.) Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history and current experience make that very clear. States have and still are failing at prohibiting discrimination We have seen how this plays out already - in the 1960s, when the federal government had to step in to force schools to stop discriminating against black people. It's one of the big reasons the Civil Rights Act passed in the first place. Similarly, the federal government passed Title IX in the 1970s after it became clear that states were failing to ensure equal opportunities for women in schools. Now the country is seeing the same kind of failure with trans people. For one, most states do not have explicit anti-discrimination protections for trans people in the workplace, housing, education, or public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public). So it's not explicitly illegal under most states' laws to fire, evict, or refuse service to someone entirely because she's trans. In fact, some states are actively discriminating against trans people. That's what North Carolina did when it passed a law that banned local nondiscrimination ordinances that include sexual orientation and gender identity, and banned trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. Some people might wonder why denying trans people access to the bathroom for their gender identity is discrimination. It's simple: Forcing trans people to use the bathroom that doesn't align with their gender identity acts as a reminder that, as far as society has come on some LGBTQ issues, it's still not completely willing to accept trans people and their identities - even if trans people pose no danger to anyone else . So to trans people, this is just another slight by society. And it's a slight most states allow - and that North Carolina explicitly embraced. This is why the Obama administration got involved. If the country believes that anti-LGBTQ discrimination should be illegal (and majorities do in every state ), but states aren't stopping that discrimination from happening, it makes sense for the federal government - which has historically done this when states fail - to intervene, especially in schools the federal government funds. That's exactly what happened. Trump's position sounds more like a dodge [Donald Trump in West Virginia.]Mark Lyons\/Getty ImagesDonald Trump in West Virginia. Given this history and Trump's position, it's odd that Trump would say this issue should be left to the states. It does, however, make sense if you see it as a dodge. After all, \"states' rights\" has long been the mantra of national-level politicians who want to stay out of touchy issues when they know where the country or their party is going. For example, Hillary Clinton said in 2006 that same-sex marriage should be left up to the states . And John McCain said the same of same-sex marriage in 2008. Trump seems to be in a similar position. He says he wants to protect trans people. But he probably realizes that some members of the Republican Party, particularly religious conservatives, wouldn't appreciate that position.

And I said I think such \"spin\", where it has occurred, is EITHER sloppy OR disingenuous. You chose to assume I was talking about you in specific, and that I was attributing the latter rather than the former. My actual words don't bear this out. In the case of the Briffa & Osborn piece, I actually tend to believe that sloppiness was the main problem. In other cases of \"spin\" (e.g., the skeptics web pages of Daly and his ilk) it is most clearly disingenousnous...I don't equate you with Daly and those folks by any stretch of the imagination. Hopefully, you know that I respect you quite a bit as a scientist! But in this case, I think you were sloppy. And the sloppiness had a real cost... And as to whether or not your statements about IPCC are fair (I didn't use the word \"disservice\"!), I'll leave that to each to decide. But personally, I think they were unfair, because they opened up IPCC to criticism that is not merited by what is actually said or shown in the iPCC report. Other IPCC authors who have contacted me feel the same way, and perhaps there may be an official response on the part of IPCC authors. I don't know. But I agree that any further discussion ought to take place in the peer-reviewed literature, Mike At 05:09 PM 4\/12\/02 +0100, Keith Briffa wrote: I agree with the sentiments expressed by Tom . However, in his latest message Mike clearly says that our perspectives piece did the IPCC a disservice. He then accuses us of spinning the ECS paper to say that MBH is an underestimate of what it purports to be and that we have been sloppy and disingenuous. Frankly this is too much to take . I am not going to let this ruin my weekend so I wait until I have calmed down and find time next week to write a response. In the meantime I just wanted to note that I disagree with these comments. Perhaps the best place to continue this discussion is in the peer review literature. Keith At 11:11 AM 4\/12\/02 -0400, Michael E. Mann wrote: Ed and others, I thought I too should chime in here one last time... I'll leave it to you, Malcolm, Keith and others to debate out the issue of any additional uncertainties, biases, etc. that might arise from RCS in the presence of limited samples. That is beyond my range of expertise. But since this is a new and relatively untested approach, and it is on the basis of this approach that other estimates are being argued to be \"underestimates\", we would indeed have been remiss now to point this out in our letter. The wording \"perilous\" perhaps should be changed, by I very much stand by the overall sentiment expressed by Malcolm in our piece with regard to RCS. One very important additional point that Malcolm makes in his message is that conservative estimates of uncertainties, appropriate additional caveats, etc. were indeed all provided in MBH99, and I have always been careful to interpret our results in the context of these uncertainties and caveats. IPCC '2001 was careful to do so to, and based its conclusions within the context of the uncertainties (hence the choice of the conservative term \"likely\" in describing the apparently unprecedented nature of late 20th century warmth) and, moreover, on the collective results of many independent reconstructions. Briffa & Osborn would have you believe that IPCC '2001's conclusions in this regard rested on MBH99 alone. Frankly, Keith and Tim, I believe that is unfair to the IPCC, whether or not one cares about being fair to MBH or not. What is unfortunate here then is that Esper et al has been \"spun\" i to argue that MBH99 underestimates the quantity it purports to estimate, full Northern Hemisphere annual mean temperature. Given the readily acknowledged level of uncertainty in both estimates, combined with the \"apples and oranges\" nature of the comparison between the two (which I have sought to clarify in my letter to Science, and in my messages to you all, and the comparison plot I provided), I believe it is either sloppy or disingenuous reasoning to argue that this is the case. The fact that this sloppiness also readily serves the interests of the skeptics is quite unfortunate, but it is indeed beside the point! It would probably also be helpful for me to point out, without naming names, that many of our most prominent colleagues in the climate research community, as well government funding agency representatives, have personally contacted me over the past few weeks to express their dismay at the way they believe this study was spun. I won't get into the blame game, because there's more than enough of that to go around. But when the leaders of our scientific research community and our funding managers personally alert us that they believe the credibility of our field has been damaged, I think it is time for some serious reflection on this episode. that's my final 2 cents, Mike _______________________________________________________________________ Professor Michael E.

{"text":"Hi all, My take on this is similar to what Peck wrote. My suggestion is to write: Greater uncertainty associated with proxy-based temperature estimates for individual years means that it is more difficult to gauge the significance, or precedence, of the extreme warm individual years observed in the recent instrumental record, such as 1998 and 2005, in the context of the last millennium. I think this is scientifically correct, and in essence means that we, as did the NAS panel say, feel the TAR statement was not what we would have said. I sympatise with those who say that it is not likely that any individual years were warmer, as Stefan has stated, but I don't think we have enough data to qualify this on the hemispheric mean. Best wishes, Eystein If this is interpreted as a critisim of the TAR, then I think we At 14:09 -0600 13-09-06, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: thanks David - lets see what others think. I agree, that we don't want to be seen as being too clever or defensive. Note however, that all the TAR said was \"likely\" the warmest in the last 1000 years. Our chapter and figs (including 6.10) make it clear that it is unlikely any multi-decadal period was as warm as the last 50 years. But, that said, I do feel your are right that our team would not have said what the TAR said about 1998, and thus, we should delete that second sentence. any other thoughts team? thx, peck Leaving aside for the moment the resolution issue, the statement should at least be consistent with our figures. Fig. 6-10 looks like there were years around 1000 AD that could have been just as warm - if one wants to make this statement, one needs to expand the vertical scale in Fig. 6-10 to show that the current warm period is 'warmer'. Now getting back to the resolution issue: given what we know about the ability to reconstruct global or NH temperatures in the past - could we really in good conscience say we have the precision from tree rings and the very sparse other data to make any definitive statement of this nature (let alone accuracy)? While I appreciate the cleverness of the second sentence, the problem is everybody will recognize that we are 'being clever' - at what point does one come out looking aggressively defensive? I agree that leaving the first sentence as the only sentence suggests that one is somehow doubting the significance of the recent warm years, which is probably not something we want to do. What I would suggest is to forget about making 'one year' assessments; what Fig. 6-10 shows is that the recent warm period is highly anomalous with respect to the record of the last 1000 years. That would be what I think we can safely conclude the last 1000 years really tells us. David At 9:10 AM -0600 9\/13\/06, Jonathan Overpeck wrote: Keith - thanks for this and the earlier updates. Stefan is not around this week, but hopefully the others on this email can weight in. My thoughts... 1) We MUST say something about individual years (and by extension the 1998 TAR statement) - do we support it, or not, and why. 2) a paragraph would be nice, but I doubt we can do that, so.. 3) I suggest putting the first sentence that Keith provides below as the last sentence, in the last (summary) para of 6.6.1.1. To make a stand alone para seems like a bad way to end the very meaty section. 4) I think the second sentence could be more controversial - I don't think our team feels it is valid to say, as they did in TAR, that \"It is also likely that, in the Northern Hemisphere,... 1998 was the warmest year\" in the last 1000 years. But, it you think about it for a while, Keith has come up with a clever 2nd sentence (when you insert \"Northern Hemisphere\" language as I suggest below). At first, my reaction was leave it out, but it grows on you, especially if you acknowledge that many readers will want more explicit prose on the 1998 (2005) issue. Greater uncertainty associated with proxy-based temperature estimates for individual years means that it is more difficult to gauge the significance, or precedence, of the extreme warm years observed in the recent instrumental record. However, there is no new evidence to challenge the statement made in the TAR that 1998 (or the subsequent near-equivalent 2005) was likely the warmest of Northern Hemisphere year over the last 1000 years. 5) I strongly agree we can't add anything to the Exec Summary. 6) so, if no one disagrees or edits, I suggest we insert the above 2 sentences to end the last (summary) para of 6.6.1.1. Or should we make it a separate, last para - see point #3 above why I don't favor that idea as much. But, it's not a clear cut issue. Thoughts? Thanks all, Peck Eystein and Peck I have thought about this and spent some time discussing it with Tim. I have come up with the following Greater uncertainty associated with proxy-based temperature estimates for individual years means that it is more difficult to gauge the significance, or precedence, of the extreme warm years observed in the recent instrumental record. However, there is no new evidence to challenge the statement made in the TAR that 1998 (or the subsequent near-equivalent 2005) was likely the warmest in the last 1000 years. This should best go after the paragraph that concludes section 6.6.1.1 I believe we might best omit the second sentence of the suggested new paragraph - but you might consider this too subtle (or negative) then. I think the second sentence is very subtle also though - because it does not exclude the possibility that the same old evidence that challenges the veracity of the TAR statement exists now , as then! I think this could go in the text where suggested , but I think it best NOT to have a bullet about this point.We need to check exactly what was saidin the TAR . Perhaps a reference to the Academy Report could also be inserted here? Anyway, you asked for a straw-man statement for all to argue about so I suggest we send this to Stefan, David , Betty and whoever else you think. cheers Keith -- Professor Keith Briffa, Climatic Research Unit University of East Anglia Norwich, NR4 7TJ, U.K. Phone: +44-1603-593909 Fax: +44-1603-507784 -- Jonathan T.

{"text":"Peck and Eystein in case you tried (!), my phone has been broken for the last few days (yes - honestly). I am sorry I had to rush off - and stay longer than I had anticipated . The funeral was delayed while a post-mortem examination had to be held to establish the precise cause of death. Ironic that dad had struggled on having had at least 3 heart attacks, 2 strokes, chronic diabetes and partial liver and kidney failure for some years (besides being virtually immobile and completely blind for 18 months). All in all , though it was a release, the actual demise was sudden and unexpected and I managed to arrive too late to be with him at the end. Given the time constraint , this \"final\" revision is not as considered as it might have been , but we have tried to take into account all comments available , and have given considerable attention to the IPCC terminology and emphasis on the bullet points . At this stage , however, there are some clear areas where future work will be required to keep abreast of recent developments and , perhaps, to re-balance the emphasis and structure. I apologise for not having responded directly to Fortunat, Stefan, Ricardo.Olga, David and Tom, but please be aware that I have considered all of their comments and done what I could to address them .Thanks Fortunat and Ricardo (and Ed - who should be added to the list of CAs) for the text and Figures and Henry and Jason for the help and data . David's suggestions about re-ordering the paragraphs was particularly difficult to resolve in my own mind , because I do see the logic , but equally , did not want to interfere with the time line approach to describing post- TAR work that underlies the current structure. as you can see I decided to leave the order as it was. It would be great if David and Fortunat could check cross Chapter referencing (eg in relation to forcings and detection chapters). We can revisit this , and the issue of McIntyre and McKitrick (centering of PCs in Mann et al reconstruction - which is clearly unfounded) until such time as the numerous responses are published. The new SH section is in , and the MWP box slightly amended to take account of the new Figure. Peck, I have considered your text on the regional section - and you will see that I have edited out some relating to future (and association between drought and SSTs) . I feel strongly that you are venturing into \"observational\" territory and speculation beyond what we should say. I have also amended the bullet points to reflect this. YOU ARE THE ULTIMATE ARBITERS and it is up to you if you wish to re-insert , but I will give you a continuing argument later about our overstepping the \"paleo\" boundary. Note also that the bullet on European summer 2004 has bee altered to reflect what was a last minute , one-sentence , insertion in the first paragraph regarding Jurg Lutterbacher's Science paper - as there was no mention of it otherwise. We had to remove the reference to \"700 years in France\" as I am not sure what this is , and it is not in the text anyway. The use of \"likely\" , \"very likely\" and my additional fudge word \"unusual\" are all carefully chosen where used. Tim has been a rock in the last minute rush here - not only doing the Figures , but also helping with the text. I am really grateful to him. He has sent the text , with some comments, and highlighted references, that need attention. If Oyvind can identify references and handle these problems with Endnote , we are also really grateful. The final references , if missing , are probably in the current text, the previous Endnote library , or in sections of text sent by Ricardo, Fortunat, Peck and Eystein. I trust when you guys have stiched the new text back in and the Figures etc. we will perhaps get a last chance to correct and check references etc. Thanks Keith -- Professor Keith Briffa, Climatic Research Unit University of East Anglia Norwich, NR4 7TJ, U.K. Phone: +44-1603-593909 Fax: +44-1603-507784 [1] References 1.","label":0}

{"text":"With edits. Specialty hit for Iowa, LGBT, Women - not national. Good for research From: Helmstetter, TJ Sent: Thursday, May 05, 2016 11:42 AM To: Walker, Eric; Paustenbach, Mark; Miranda, Luis; Freundlich, Christina Subject: APPROVE: Grassley hit To: LGBT list, Iowa list. SL: Grassley Floats SCOTUS Pick That Would Help Trump \"Punish\" Women Last week, Chuck Grassley said it would be a \"gamble \" to let Donald Trump fill the Supreme Court vacancy. But it seems Grassley is now fine with the most dangerous presidential nominee in history - a man who said women should be \"punished \" for an abortion - shaping the court for generations. Yesterday , Grassley said Trump would nominate \"the right type of people\" and specifically cited Judge William Pryor as someone Trump might appoint. Let's take a look at some of Judge Pryor's greatest hits: * Pryor called Roe v. Wade \"the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\" * Pryor opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest. * Pryor urged Congress to repeal Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. * Pryor was the only Attorney General in the nation to file an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the federal remedy for victims of sexual assault in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional. * In 2005, Lambda Legal called Pryor \"the most demonstrably antigay judicial nominee in recent memory .\" * Editorial boards across the country denounced George W. Bush's nomination of Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit. \"No one is more qualified to immediately serve on the Supreme Court than Chief Judge Merrick Garland. The fact that Chuck Grassley refuses to give him a fair hearing or up-and-down vote betrays his constitutional responsibility. The fact that Grassley is waiting for Donald Trump to fill the seat with a divisive extremist like William Pryor who will implement Trump's plan to 'punish ' women for abortions is downright shameful. Grassley and the Senate Republicans need to do their jobs and confirm Chief Judge Garland rather than playing political games that put our democracy's checks and balances at risk.\" - TJ Helmstetter, DNC spokesperson TJ Helmstetter Deputy Director of Regional and Specialty Media Democratic National Committee 202.863.8022 - desk 973.464.9224 - cell HelmstetterT@DNC.org","label":0}

{"text":"Subject Line: Cruz in December: @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt Body: Ted Cruz is as disingenuous as they come. Back in December, when Cruz thought he could help his own poll numbers by clinging to Donald Trump like a baby koala, he tweeted this: Now that Cruz has no path to nomination, he's decided to lash out and throw the oppo book at Trump in a last-ditch effort to save his own grand political ambitions. But at the end of the day, Cruz still hasn't reneged on his promise to support Trump as the GOP nominee. So there you have it: Ted Cruz's criticisms of Trump have nothing to do with conviction and everything to do with what helps Ted Cruz politically. Ironically, in a press conference that may prove to be Cruz's last as a candidate, he seems to have perfectly confirmed the moniker used against him in this campaign. He really is Lyin' Ted.","label":0}

{"text":"Hi Henry - thanks for the email. Just earlier today, Eystein and I were soliciting approval from our team on how to best get feedback from chapter authors - Lead Authors and Contributing Authors alike. Since we're all authors, it isn't appropriate to comment officially as expert reviewers, but rather to work as a team to take expert reviews - AND chapter 6 author feedback - and use them to create a better finalo draft. One key, as promised earlier, is to have a process that makes sure we get all comments and are able to respond to them. The other key is that we ensure time to allow the needed debate. Eystein and I are going to ask LAs (including Keith) to do there work sooner in the draft cycle than before so that we have the time for this. So... I would suggest you keep these comments in a safe place for a bit longer, and then send them in to the Eystein and I when we ask (should be in the next week). Note that the current draft has only officially been available for a bit over a week (indeed, I didn't see it until today since the IPCC TSU had to check for all sorts of things after we submitted it over a month ago), and we won't be working on the new draft until June. So we have time to be thoughtful and complete in the feedback gathering process. Is this ok? Seems more suitable than giving review via the gov process on your own work (you are an author of our chapter). Also, I can anticipate one thing that is going to come up again, and that I don't think we had your feedback on (nor Keith's). What about the borehole recons that you and colleagues have done extending back beyond the last couple centuries. I don't have my paper pdf collection here, but I believe you have some recons going back many centuries. Does this need more attention in the chapter? Thanks for being proactive and quick to send feedback. We'll be sending our email to all CA's soon, if you're willing to wait a couple more days.

WASHINGTON \u2014 If you were hoping Republicans had fresh new solutions for health care reform up their sleeves, you might find the recent hints from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a bit disappointing. After six years of the GOP failing to come up with a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act, what Ryan outlined during an appearance at Georgetown University on Wednesday was essentially another stab at a decades-old idea that's never really worked \u2014 an idea that would involve allowing health insurance companies to resume charging sick people higher rates than healthy people. The cornerstone of Ryan's approach is so-called high-risk pools, a form of health insurance designed for people with the most serious health conditions and highest costs, who were mostly locked out of the regular private market before the Affordable Care Act required insurers to accept all applicants. If the concept sounds familiar, it's because high-risk pools have existed since 1976 , and are a go-to policy proposal for Republicans who don't want to be accused of not caring about people with pre-existing conditions. High-risk pools have been part of countless conservative reform platforms, including a recent plan from the House Republican Study Committee and a not-so-recent one from the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). They were even included in a 2009 House Republican bill that was supposed to be the GOP alternative to the ACA, but that the Congressional Budget Office said would only reduce the ranks of the uninsured by 3 million people over a decade (in contrast to Obamacare, which has reduced the uninsured by 20 million since 2013). \"We can and should and must fix that,\" Ryan said in response to a question from a student who said his family had benefited from Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \"The smarter way, in my opinion, is that we as a society make a decision at the government level that we will buck up and subsidize those people with pre-existing conditions.\" Ryan said. Reuters first reported Ryan's remarks. The problem is, high-risk pools \u2014 which existed in 35 states before the Affordable Care Act made them virtually obsolete \u2014 always failed to achieve their goal of providing a true insurer of last resort to those who needed it. The biggest reason is money: Covering the medical costs of the sickest people in the country is very expensive, and the government has never devoted the funds necessary to make this work. \"High-risk pools are never successful in providing affordable coverage for people who otherwise had no alternative,\" said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Conceptually, it doesn't work. You can keep throwing money at it, but it's a losing proposition over time.\" Ryan said the federal government would subsidize these high-risk pools at the state level. But promises of additional government spending on health seem dubious from the leader of a House Republican Conference heavily influenced by tea party lawmakers trying to shrink the government as much as possible. And these are the same promises that led to the creation of the pre-Obamacare high-risk pools in the first place. They didn't pan out. \"For 35 years, states tried to meet this challenge, but never could,\" Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told The Huffington Post in an email. In any given year, about one-fifth of Americans account for around four-fifths of health care spending, and high-risk pools are designed to attract the very sickest and most expensive customers, Pollitz said. Faced with this reality, the government cut back on the old high-risk pools rather than spend what it would have taken to make them functional. \"They looked for other ways to limit costs of their state high risk pool programs \u2014 surcharging premiums, imposing high deductibles and low lifetime limits, and most of all, excluding people based on their pre-existing conditions,\" Pollitz said. \"That meant the vast majority of people who were eligible for and needed [high-risk pool] coverage couldn't enroll.\" In other words, states found out that covering all these sick people cost a ton of money they weren't willing to spend, so they scaled back the programs and cut off new enrollment. These pools wound up covering only a small share of so-called uninsurable people and a tiny share of the total uninsured population, and low-income people typically couldn't afford the premiums, according to a study published in 2005. The Government Accountability Office found that as of 2008, fewer than 200,000 people were covered by high-risk pools, out of nearly 4 million who should have been eligible. Ryan also indicated he wants to \"open up underwriting,\" which in insurance jargon means allowing insurers to charge higher rates to people based on their medical histories. Under Obamacare, insurers can't do that. They also can't make women pay more than men, and they can only charge middle-aged people up to three times the premiums paid by young adults. Ryan's proposal to \"open up underwriting\" would affect people not deemed sick enough to join a high-risk pool \u2014 which could mean everyone with common ailments like diabetes and asthma, or a healthy person with a history of cancer or other diseases. That's how the insurance market worked when underwriting was permitted before the Affordable Care Act. This was part of Ryan's argument to the college-aged audience that letting insurance companies once again discriminate against the sick, and moving the most ailing into a separate program, would be good for them. Young people would pay lower health insurance premiums if older, sicker people were in a separate program, he said. But that doesn't account for the cost to taxpayers of whatever government subsidies would be provided to people in the high-risk pools. And it ignores the reality that everyone, if they live long enough, goes from being the healthy person to being the sick person, Pollitz said. Earlier in his appearance at Georgetown, Ryan repeated his promise that Republicans would finally tell Americans how they would do health care reform differently. \"What does patient-centered health care look like? We don't think the Affordable Care Act is working,\" he said. \"News flash: Republicans are against Obamacare. But we owe it to people to show what we would replace it with. We have to show what we would do differently.\" Ryan didn't offer a lot of fine detail in his four-minute reply to the student's question. Republicans will supposedly unveil a health care plan this summer, and maybe it will address the shortcomings apparent in what Ryan did say this week. For now, though, his plan sounds like it won't be as good for people with pre-existing conditions as what they already have under Obamacare.","label":0}

{"text":"20020717 Lockergnome Penguin Shell 07.17.2002 PenguinREPORT CAREER SERVICES FROM LOCKERGNOME AND DICE.COM: We've teamed up with Dice.com to bring you a full service I.T. career enhancement solution. Whether you are looking for your dream job or trying to hire talented people, the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your IT talent solution today! I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort through my email system. It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2 upgrade at $129. I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources. On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the company's history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was the result of the Mandrake Linux User's Club. The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com. I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the addition of both Lindows and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved. Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use. There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple configuration issue. To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in your KDE panel. Select \"Preferences\" and the \"Execute\" tab. In the Execute window, change the command line to read: kmail --check -caption \"%c\" %i %m The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when you open the program. Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right? Recommend It!

With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel configuration is dense with details and options. I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options. For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos: The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel configuration issues Linux Network Security from Linux Planet a nice tutorial on network security Network Security with \/proc\/sys\/net\/ipv4 other approaches to network security These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your Linux kernel. Recommend It!

{"text":"05\/16\/2016 05:46 AM EDT By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com) Good Monday morning, and huge thanks to the two Celebrity Guest Playbookers -- Ben Smith, one of the great journalistic innovators, and Marc Caputo, master of Florida politics - who held down the fort while I spent a few days in Maine fishing, four-wheeling and eating fried food. VEEP INTRIGUE - \"Castro moves to stop VP fire from the left,\" by Isaac Dovere: \"Targeted by progressive activists hoping to kill his chances of being picked as Hillary Clinton's running mate, Juli\u00e1n Castro is set this week to announce changes to what's become a hot-button [HUD] program for selling bad mortgages on its books. ... Castro's actions could potentially defuse an issue that activists have been using to question his progressive credentials.\"  PLAYBOOK IN-BOX - MATT McDONALD, Hamilton Place Strategies partner, McKinsey alumnus, associate communications director in George W. Bush White House, and senior counselor on GOP campaigns: \"I've always thought of establishment as those who put winning #1 and ideology #2, and I've thought of the grassroots as putting ideology #1 and winning #2. \"Now, it's the establishment that seems to be having ideological reservations and the grassroots who are embracing someone who doesn't adhere to the norms of conservative thought. Not sure that winning is actually part of the thinking here at all for anyone.\" LOOK FOR A WAVE of stories like this ... \"On more than one issue, GOP's Trump sounds like a Democrat,\" by AP's Jill Colvin, with Lisa Lerer in D.C.: \"[O]n ... trade and national defense, the billionaire businessman could even find himself running to the left of Hillary Clinton ... Trump is a classic Republican in many ways. He rails against environmental and corporate regulations, proposes dramatically lower tax rates.\"  --Kansas City Star, \"Trade policy issues are blurring old lines, turning politics in 2016 inside out,\" by Dave Helling: \"Free-trade Republicans are becoming protectionist, while some Democrats are moving the opposite direction on exports and imports. The flip-flops are making it harder to reach consensus in Washington.\"  --GRAPHIC ... N.Y. Times Upshot on May 11, \"Where Trump Breaks With the Republican Party,\" by Alan Rappeport and Alicia Parlapiano: \"He aligns more with Democrats on some economic issues.\"  YOU'RE INVITED! Mike Allen and Darius Dixon (engineer, geologist and Politico energy reporter) interview Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz at a Playbook Breakfast on WEDNESDAY. Doors open at 7:30 a.m. at the W Hotel. RSVP  MONEY HONEYS -- \"In Koch World 'Realignment,' Less National Politics,\" by National Review's Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson: \"[T]he brothers' political decision-making [is] increasingly being influenced by their business and public-relations interests, and ... their investments in electoral politics at the federal level [ARE] diminishing.\"  CLINTON STRATEGERY - \"Clinton caught in end-of-the-primary trap ... [N]eeds to start focusing on Donald Trump. But she can't ... without alienating Bernie Sanders' supporters,\" by Gabe Debenedetti: \"Republicans are getting a head start on November ... Democrats may have an unprecedented opportunity to win over the significant number of GOP voters ... and the Clinton campaign is unable to take full advantage. ... [S]he has held just two open events in Ohio and Virginia in recent weeks, intent on remaining in places with upcoming primaries lest she appear to be looking too far beyond Sanders.\"  2016 PLAYERS: Miguel Angel Ayala, press secretary at Small Business Administration, named Nevada comms director for Clinton campaign. JUST POSTED - \"The return of John Boehner: The ex-speaker, far from receding into retirement, is making headlines and set to barnstorm the country to elect House Republicans,\" by Jake Sherman: \"The former House speaker will spend late July and all of August on a cross-country bus trip raising money and campaigning for House Republicans ... The trip - on Boehner's bus, dubbed 'Freedom One' - will begin after the [RNC] in Cleveland and end Labor Day weekend.\"  --\"Trump backers face 'scam PAC' charges,\" by Politico Influence's Isaac Arnsdorf and Ken Vogel: \"An increasing number of unauthorized groups are invoking the presumptive GOP nominee's name to raise money, suggesting that they'll use the cash to support his campaign, even as some appear to be spending most of their money on contracts with favored consultants. Trump's campaign and its allies worry that the groups are doing little to help the campaign, and may be doing more harm than good by siphoning off cash that would otherwise go to the campaign's fledgling fundraising effort.\"  MEDIAWATCH - \"How the New York Times plans to conquer the world ... in search of a sustainable digital business,\" by Politico's Joe Pompeo in New York and Alex Spence in London: The \"Times now has north of a million digital subscribers, but only 13 percent are from outside the United States. ... [CEO Mark Thompson:] 'I don't see why we shouldn't aspire to a digital subscriber count [overseas] of many millions' ... NYT Global ... will be looking at developing new editorial products around certain topics with broad global appeal, like climate change, technology, gender identity and urban life.\"  --\"60 Minutes' honors correspondent Morley Safer as he retires,\" by AP Television Writer Frazier Moore: \"The tribute marked the close of a 61-year career for Safer, who, according to the program, has had the longest-ever run on prime-time television.

{"text":"From: Michael Briggs Sent: Wednesday, May 04, 2016 6:14 PM To: Brinster, Jeremy Subject: ICYMI: Bernie Sanders would be Donald Trump's worst nightmare; Hillary, not so much New York Daily News: Bernie Sanders would be Donald Trump's worst nightmare; Hillary, not so much By Shaun King May 4, 2016 You may not like Donald Trump. Hell, you may hate his guts and think he is the worst thing to ever happen to American politics in modern history. If you called him an offensive, sexist, xenophobic bigot, I'd be first in line to agree with you. Yes, his skin is orange and his hair is ridiculous. He's also an incredibly formidable politician who just beat the dog crap out of more than a dozen different Republicans including the current governors from Ohio, Wisconsin and New Jersey, two widely-known multi-term governors from Florida and Texas, four current U.S. senators from Kentucky, South Carolina, Florida and Texas, a doctor and a former tech CEO. One by one, they all underestimated Donald Trump, overestimated themselves and made it abundantly clear that they have no earthly idea what conservative American voters are looking for in 2016. The GOP's top contenders raised more money than Donald, outspent him and out-hired him. Still, with virtually no support from the political establishment and very little ground game to speak of, he swatted them all away like flies. I can't stand the man, but what he just did was strange, historic and unprecedented. I've said it before, and I'll say it again \u2014 Donald Trump could very well be the next President of the United States. Now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee, and appears to be attempting to moderate his tone a bit, he is more dangerous than ever. Underestimate him and his candidacy at your own risk. Hillary Clinton is perhaps the worst possible Democratic candidate who could ever run against Donald Trump. I sincerely believe he could beat her in the general election. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, would give Donald Trump fits in a head-to-head match up. Let me break it down. 1. Like Donald's other fallen foes, Hillary Clinton represents the political establishment. This narrative is strong and served as the primary crutch of Donald's strategy to defeat an enormous, well-funded Republican field. Americans are incredibly frustrated with our government and Donald used this very real sentiment to position himself as the anti-establishment candidate. Call it nonsensical, but this position, which Donald will hold against Hillary, is what President Obama used to defeat her in 2008, is what George W. Bush used to defeat Al Gore in 2000, and was even what Bill Clinton used to defeat George H.W. Bush in 1992. Hillary Clinton is as establishment as establishment gets. The machine is behind her. Her campaign against Bernie Sanders has only advanced this sentiment. Donald Trump simply could not use this angle against Bernie Sanders. 2. Hillary's millions of dollars worth of paid speeches to banks, lobbyists and billionaires cede a certain moral high ground to Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a filthy rich fat cat. He's gaudy and cartoonish with his wealth. He openly admits that he hires foreign workers for cheap jobs and abuses tax loopholes. He is the poster child for everything that Bernie Sanders has railed against \u2014 not just in this campaign, but for his entire life in public service. Hillary Clinton will not really be able to say much about this, though, because Donald's biggest liability is also an enormous liability for her. What's worse, being Scrooge McDuck, or getting paid to speak to a room full of Scrooge McDucks over and over and over again and refusing to release the transcripts of what you said to them? She and Bill rented a home in the Hamptons for $50,000 per week. They've made $230 million since Bill left office. Hillary made more money in 12 speeches to big banks than most American's will make in their lifetime. Bernie Sanders is a career public servant and will be so until the day he dies. His entire life stands in stark contrast to the outrageous opulence of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The thought that this angle will basically be off the table if the campaign is between Donald and Hillary is simply dumb. 3. Independent and new voters are flocking to Bernie Sanders and even to Donald Trump, but not to Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders is the longest standing Independent in the history of the United States Congress. Consequently, independent voters have flocked to his campaign en masse. When they are allowed to vote in primaries, like they did on Tuesday in Indiana, he wins. They have been absolutely essential to his wins in 18 different states thus far. With only 29% of Americans identifying as Democrats and 26% as Republicans, the largest voting bloc is independents. Those voters make-up a large spectrum of political views and demographics, but they are all united in their frustrations with the government, the status quo and lobbyists. I believe many independent voters will stay at home if Bernie Sanders isn't a candidate. It will be up to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party to win them over, but they've expressed very little interest in such a thing thus far. Many more conservative independents will indeed vote for Trump. 4. Hillary's reliance on millions of dollars from SuperPACs is a real problem. Zero percent of Bernie's campaign funds come from SuperPACs. Four percent of Donald's campaign funds come from SuperPACs. Hillary? More than seven times that amount. An astounding 30% of her campaign funds come from SuperPACs. Donald Trump could feasibly decide he isn't taking a dime from them and put Hillary in a position to defend her reliance on them. This would never be an issue for Bernie Sanders. It is his rejection of SuperPAC money that has actually won over millions of his voters. For them, this issue is everything. The idea of supporting the candidate who relies so heavily on this type of money nauseates many. Donald Trump will be able to get on the mic and tell supporters that he just isn't influenced by outside money and they'll believe him. 5. Young voters are crazy about Bernie Sanders and just don't care Hillary Clinton. By young, we don't just mean teenagers. Voters under 25, voters under 35, even voters under 45 all support Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton. The younger voter, the bigger the margin. In some age groups he's beating her by 85%-15%. These young voters were the lifeblood and energy of Barack Obama's campaign and they have virtually rejected Clinton altogether in this campaign. They are incredibly loyal to Bernie. They trust him and believe in him. They won't simply or easily transfer over to another campaign. This is a real problem for Clinton and will show immediately in a general election. Hating Trump is not the same thing as supporting Hillary Clinton and young voters know this. While Donald Trump doesn't have a youth movement of any kind to talk about, it just matters a heck of a lot less if it's Clinton he's going against. Bernie has consistently said that he does better in every poll in a head to head match up against Donald Trump than Hillary does. The non-partisan fact-checkers at Politifact found this claim to be accurate. In one new poll, Trump actually leads by 2 points in a race against Hillary. In another, she's just up by 3 points against Trump. Bernie beats Trump in every poll and by larger margins. This race isn't new anymore. People know enough about Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to make an informed decision. I believe these polls are accurate. The team at FiveThirtyEight stated that they believe the polls between Trump and Clinton will continue to narrow. We can all agree that Trump must be stopped, but this much is clear - Hillary Clinton is not the best opponent to stop him. [Image removed by sender.]","label":0}
