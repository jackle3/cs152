YOU WILL EARN 10% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR TEAMS CLIENT BASE! PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE! If you are working in the merchant cash advance\/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully. Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation. Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make. What a disaster that would be. Wouldn't you agree? But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal. We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry. We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country. The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify. Your manager's agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals. Gross profit for our Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions. Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company. An Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders. Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place). If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit. On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1\/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1\/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60\/40. So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager. Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month. Even on the subprime deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal. So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%, Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees. On a 50K subprime deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager. Your manager's agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps. Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left. This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days. We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid, We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail. We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way. We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A. Recruit Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B. Train Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C. Manage Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company) If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business. If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins. This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person. If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad. If you are a rep sitting in someone else's business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply. We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area. But you may recruit offline wherever you want. So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back. Again, \"NO EXPERIENCE IN THE MCA INDUSTRY\", \"NO POSITION\". . .","label":0}

{"text":"Introduction The simple recipe for wild success in tech has always been: make a great product and sell it well. Every day, people say things like this about Intercom: Have said it before, but have genuinely never been more impressed with a web product than @intercom - simple concept brilliantly executed. We're hiring a Head of Product Marketing because it's now time to sell as well as we delight our customers. About the company and the product Intercom, Inc. is just over one year old. In 2012 we raised $1M, grew the team from 4 to 14, and started charging. In early 2013 we'll announce the next generation of our product, plus some exciting traction and revenue. The company is founded by two designers and two engineers who've spent the past 5 years building web products and companies together. Originally from Ireland, we've based our engineering office in Dublin and set up our headquarters in San Francisco. At the core of our culture is a passion for simple, well designed software that solves real problems for many people. We care far more about creating something great than having people think we're great. We make decisions based on principles, values, and instinct, rather than following trends. Our mission is to make web business personal. As software \"eats the world\", all businesses are becoming web businesses. The potential for these businesses to sell to and support customers at scale is truly awesome. But the \"low touch\" approach this requires has a nasty side-effect: businesses don't know or talk to the people who use their product, and customers don't know or talk to the people who make the product. Intercom fixes this. It's a product with three integrated parts: Discover: A live database of users, allowing business people to understand who's using their product and how. Engage: An outbound communications tool which lets businesses manually or automatically send personalised, targeted messages to their customers to drive usage of their product. Respond: A customer service tool designed to allow businesses to support their customers quickly and in a personal manner. Together and separately, we think these products and our plans for them are highly innovative. From a product perspective, think of Intercom as a brand new way to understand, reach out to, and respond to your customers. From a marketing point of view, think of Intercom as a business with the potential to disrupt Salesforce, Marketo, and Zendesk. Intercom is installed in thousands of web products and tracks many millions of users. About the role This is our first marketing hire. The Head of Product Marketing will work directly with the CEO and have the opportunity to grow a team. They will be responsible for: Knowing what jobs the market wants done, and what the competition is offering. Collaborating with product management to deliver products that best do these jobs, and at the right price for the customer and the company. Owning the positioning and messaging of these products, and finding ways to describe them in the simplest and most enticing fashion possible. Running projects to create the content required to communicate this. As we expand our business management team, they will either work alongside other marketing roles or move into Head of Marketing and hire for Product Marketing, Inbound Marketing, PR, etc.","label":0}
