Well after this you won't want to contract again. Why? We're betting that after 3 months with us you'll stay on in a permanent role. You'll be working with an integrated team of developers, testers and designers on one of the largest Rails apps in the world. We're in a great place to work with hard problems in a complex business domain. And we pay permanent rates that will make you want to stick around. What's more you'll spend the first couple of weeks on our dedicated training team where we'll challenge you to write more elegant code. When we're happy with your code you will move onto our delivery teams either working on the core product, the API, Australian specific changes or on UX heavy tasks. Still reading? Before you decide where you want to work and especially before you choose the worst contract ever, think about what you want most. Where do you wish you were working? Do you want a startup where you have freedom to change things and use cool technology, or is it more important to have a stable corporate job somewhere with a working business plan and competent managers? What's more important: getting paid well, or working with awesome people? Don't compromise. Powershop has all this and more. We're at the sweet spot. We're making a good profit and we have 75,000 customers, but we're still small enough that everyone is a key player in getting things done. We're successful enough that we have all the resources we need, but it's still early days and passionate people are making big tech decisions. We're also growing fast. We need experienced developers to help us develop and export our software around the globe. Sounds great, right? So what else is worst? Well, it's a high performance kind of place with no exceptions. It's fast and we don't tolerate bullshit. We expect beautiful and elegant solutions and we respect you for your teamwork and output, not for your X year's experience in being oarsome. We judge seniority based on how much you can teach, not on what you know. So there's a high barrier to entry and a complex domain, but it's fun and people love working here. We're looking for developers who are passionate about elegant code and contributing to a healthy and respectful work culture. If you're smart and willing to be challenged, you'll fit in well. We use Ruby and for this role we expect you to have plenty of experience with it too. You, along with everyone else we hire, will start on the dedicated training team until we're happy with your elegant code. Prepare to be challenged! Here's why you want to work here: Work on hard problems with super smart people in a fast team. We think you'll like it so much here that you'll stick around. Learn like crazy, no matter what your current skill level. Use whatever platform you like. Whatever editor you want. Do TDD? Great. Hate it? Fine. Pair programming? If you like. Stand up or sit down desk. Work how you like working. We're serious about agile. We do scrum, small integrated dev\/design\/test teams, peer code reviews and automated tests because they make for better software. 10% of your time is spent on your own projects.

We've worked hard to turn the industry on its head and have built a company that people don't just like but actually love. You don't get to remake electricity retailing from the ground up by employing cynics or clock-watchers. We look for people who give a shit about what they do.

Our Client Services Managers work directly with our attorney clients, and you'll support them in that effort. 2) Assist with configuring marketing systems for our own marketing campaigns - the ones which bring customers to us. You'll help manage our markting automation, email campaigns, website, blog, webinars, etc. While this is not a programming job, you should be comfortable with the basic configuration of online tools. If you are comfortable deploying a Wordpress site, including adding themes and plugins, and doing basic HTML\/CSS then you'll do fine. We can teach you all the other systems. If you're not completely comfortable with this level of technical configuration, then this probably isn't a fit. If you are experienced with configuring marketing automation systems (such as Infusionsoft, Office Autopilot\/Ontraport, etc) then you are very qualified. Working With Us Our offices are in San Francisco, CA, but you may work remotely anywhere in the world so long as your work day overlaps with our work day (9am - 5pm Pacific) by at least two hours every work day. This is a full time position. Applicants are expected to not have any other employment, freelance or otherwise. Our Hiring Process Our hiring process is different. That's because we're serious about a long-term partnership with you, and we're willing to put in the time up front to ensure it's a fit for both of us. That also means you'll need to put in extra time as well, but as a result you'll know whether this is the place for you. Our process is designed to find superstars who want to work with other superstars. People interested in a fundamentally different organization where everyone is motivated for excellence, and everyone gets to work on things which make the most of their abilities. But, you can't tell who's a superstar from a resume, and it doesn't come across in a short interview either. So our process is designed to let you get to know us, and us to get to know you, before we move on to meeting in person or via video call. We typically screen over 130 applicants before we hire someone because we're looking for the best candidate \u2013 and one who's also motivated to work with top-performing colleagues. As you read this process, do not get intimidated. The first steps are intended to give you a picture of who we are and what we do, so you can get a feel for what it's like working with us. As the process goes along further, it gets more personal. If it's a fit then rest assured you'll have more than enough time to get all the information you need and speak personally with us to make a good decision for you. Step 1. First, you'll fill in an application, with a little information about you. As a part of this application, you'll be asked to answer a few questions, and also shoot us a quick video introducing yourself (60-90 seconds) so we can get a better idea of who you are. We don't care about the quality of the video, we just want to see how you communicate since you'll be working remotely and communication is very important for success in this role. Step 2. If your application looks like a fit, we'll send you a series of videos about our company and its products. Watch those videos to get a sense for the problems we're solving, and why lawyers want our solution. Then we'll ask you how your experience fits with the products you learned about in the videos. Step 3. Our recruiter will be in touch to request other information, do a phone\/skype screening call, and discuss next steps. You should not contact the company outside this process.","label":0}

You will enjoy the regular workload of releases and the part you have to play in making sure the system is configured right in every environment you work in. What this role isn't This is not an IT System Admin role, nor is it a routine business administration role. You're not a developer and don't need to be a techie. But if you can create basic SQL queries, view logs and edit flat files comfortably, that'll do nicely. If you understand version control in environments, and broadly understand how databases work, even better. Interested? To be considered, you must have: - Hands-on experience with SQL and\/or another database - Experience of working with outsourced IT service providers - A track record of liaising with customers and stakeholders - Experience of working cross-functionally to design and implement change - Experience of the management and configuration of parameter driven systems - At a minimum, A-Levels The ideal System Super User will have financial services industry experience. IT service provision experience would also be an advantage, as would multi-site \/ multicultural organisation experience. Specific experience regarding Pancredit systems, such as MADE, Core, Back Office, Front Office or Control Panel, would be equally favourable. Please send your CV to Darren Curley.","label":0}
