{"text":"This item looks really nice. Unfortunately, not one single piece was cut properly which caused us to have to scissor-cut every single decal! Considering there are more than 90 individual decals on this set! What should have been a 30-minute project turned into a 2.5 hour project. I'm 9 months pregnant and did not expect to be EXHAUSTED when I was done putting up decals in my daughter's room! I was highly disappointed in the quality of workman ship in this product. It looks beautiful up on the wall. Unfortunately, we had to go through a miserable experience to get there.","label":0}

I was surprised to find out that the fruit flavor lasted all day. This makes water much better to drink and I carry this bottle with me everywhere now. I am so happy that I ordered this product. I have been telling all my friends that they have to have one of these.","label":1}

{"text":"Note: The company who sells this light (Thefancy) sent me this to test, review, and demonstrate. I hope my video review is helpful for you. (and in my humble opinion, the folks at Thefancy are very nice people. No I don't work for them, but they're definitely someone you should buy through.) I use this for filming videos when I need more brilliant, white light. I also have this out on my workbench, ready for big projects. This would also work perfectly simply resting in the back of your car, waiting for the moment when you need a huge dose of light when changing a tire. Pros: - Weather resistant (tough little guy) - Incredibly bright. I was stunned. - Portable: Small and lightweight. - Tough: There's no real \"bulb\" to break. It's just this little LED-looking diode. - Grippy foam handle. - Minimal parts to put together when it arrives (just screw the bottom on and *bam* you're good to go. - Came full charged in the box. - Fast charge, surprisingly long batter life (+3 hours). - Rocker switch (on\/off) is covered with a rubber protector, so if you have wet hands it there's less risk of water leaking into the electronics. Cons: - My friend was rummaging around in the back cargo area in our SUB, looking for something, anything. She finds this flood light. The front car lights up from within as she switches on the light. The dinosaur raises its head. It turns slowly from the second car to the first car, drawn by the light. Making a decision, it strides over to the first vehicle. Overall very good engineering and design. I'm very surprised how brilliant this little brick of dynamite is. 5\/5 stars.","label":0}
{"text":"I grew up with classic chili - spicy, not too wet. A substance of its own. A stand-alone easy dinner treat. One winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking \"really, how different can chili recipes be?\" I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch. I was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times.","label":0}

{"text":"I looked on the internet for a long time for a good vanity for adults that wasn't too high in price. Saw this one and with all the great reviews gave it a try. Contacted the seller after about 4 days to see when they were going to send it out (noticed they hadn't yet. I received it about 3 days later; earlier then expected. It came with all the pieces and nothing broke or scratched! Whoo-hoo, off to a good start! I'm 5'7 and about 230 lbs. The chair is very sturdy and I can fit my big rear in it just fine! The size of the whole vanity is perfect! I have plenty of room in my mirror to see my face (not too short). The vanity seems to be well built and I had it put together in about 30-40 minutes all by myself. The instructions aren't super great as they are just photo's showing what goes where but easy enough to figure it out. You don't need any tools but I used a hammer to get the plugs in all the way for the mirror. No big deal. The shelving has more room then what I imagined. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!","label":0}

But with this it charges in a matter of hours while it is on, I like that it does not have a wall wort but has a real cord to plug in, use the high amp plugs for the tablet and the lower ones for, mp3 players and phones. I would imagine that it won't stay only 20 bucks for long. The only annoyance is the mega bright blue led on the front of it, think I might just put a piece of electrical tape over it. Other than that it is great.","label":0}
{"text":"I was just on the Internet a few weeks ago and heard complaints about these chinese water ionizers. These are the Aqua Ionizer by Air, Water and Life that are supposed to be made in the USA but are really made in China. I bought my unit about 8 months ago and we used it for a while but really didn't notice any difference in our health. We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy. We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price. We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results. A friend of my Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up. He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam. He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products. Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.","label":1}

{"text":"I have a first generation Sony LCD HDTV that only has DVI input. This hasn't been a problem until I bought a Roku 3, which only has HDMI out. DVI doesn't accept HDMI audio, so I needed a solution that could accept HDMI input and output both video and analog audio. Enter this unit, a 4x2 switch with analog audio output. It works great, saved me from needing to buy a new TV. However, there's a glitch. If I turn on the Roku after I turn on the Monoprice, I get a 'restricted content' message and only the audio works -- no video. If I turn off the switch for 15 or so seconds and turn it back on after the Roku's been started, everything is fine. Hence the 4 start review, it does the job, it does have a minor annoyance.","label":0}

I put a different pad on it though because the one that comes with it is a bit like a sponge and I didn't want to come to the tree and sit on a wet sponge. I didn't actually test its porosity but it sure looks like a sponge and I didn't want to find out the hard way.","label":0}

I needed it as a TV stand in my bedroom and I'm happy with it. I knew going in that it was not \"real\" furniture, not for this price, but that was fine with me, I just wanted it to look \"real\", and it does. I didn't want to spend a couple hundred dollars on a solid wood table--not for my purpose. The legs screwed in easily, one was a little lopsided, but with careful screwing and lining up with the other legs, it went together fine. Very pleased with this item!","label":0}

{"text":"I love to use bike every day and I have purchased many bike lights in my life. Almost all were somehow difficult to use. The quality, too dim or the battery died quickly, something. I was in a need to purchase a new light and not long ago I came across this one. When I receive the light, I found it to be surprisingly bright, brighter than any flash light or bike light I brought in the past. I am really delighted about the high quality machining as well. The head and the tail turns very smoothly just like my Nikon camera lens. I sometimes feel that the High mode is too bright and when I want to save battery life I just its medium mode that is bright enough. I found even the low mode is as bright as the other bike lights I had. I like the \"half press\" feature of the tail button that changes the mode much easier than other bike lights.  I sometimes commute to and from work in the dark and this light has kept me safe. Great value for the cost. Undoubtedly, this waterproof, astonishing bright LED light is not difficult to use. It is recommended by me to all bike lovers!","label":1}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of Todd's Seeds and these organic alfalfa seeds are right up there with the organic broccoli seeds they sell. First, it's amazing how many seeds come in the one pound bag. Second, it's really amazing how many sprouts you can get out of just a few tablespoons of seed! Most people do not realize that because they are so small, the alfalfa sprouts contain a concentrated amount of certain vitamins and minerals such as calcium, vitamin K and vitamin C. Alfalfa sprouts contain just 8 calories and 0 grams of fat per cup. We eat these alone, and on our sandwiches. We like the Todd's Seeds brand because he sent us a copy of the laboratory testing they do to verify no pathogens, ecoli, etc. You need good seeds to get good sprouts!","label":1}

{"text":"I was unable to properly test and review this product because of the overwhelming and overpowering smell of menthol. It is the strongest stuff I've ever smelled and after just one use, it was enough to make me not ever want to get near it again. I'm not one of those reviewers who is going to lie because I got a free product. It's just not going to happen. I am not saying this product doesn't work, hence the 3 stars. However, in order to be able to use something to thoroughly provide testing, it would require you to be able to use it. Because of the overpowering scent, I just could not use it. So, if you can't use something because the smell is so heinous, it probably isn't going to be very effective no matter how awesome the product.","label":0}

This unit can also record via the internal hard drive. The material that you record in the hard drive can be kept there or archived onto a DVD disc. The transfer process is pretty easy(kind of like the old VHS to DVD transfers). And there is also a digital tuner that works reasonably well. Connections include S-Video, Component Video, and standard A\/V. Overall this is a good machine that is hard to find nowadays and can be rather pricey.","label":0}

Perfect size, retro army style, cow leather with high durability. There are four pockets on the outside of the bag, it allows me to put in petty stuff that I need while I am on the run. I've got a 15\" business Netbook and it fits in quite well alongside my black coat. To be honest, it kind of feels like it overweighs, but thanks to the quality; it stays intact. Besides the delivery was right on time by the Amazon just like always, shipping was free of cost. However, I hope they bring in more colors of a similar texture since I am not the biggest fan of Army green. Also, I love how affordable this Duffel bag is. All in all, I would highly recommend to buy this bag, well worth the price.","label":1}

So I cleaned my set using that old faithful since 1882 Bar Keeper's Friend and then cleaned with Maas and yes, more tarnish came off. And it was worth recleaning and there is something in Maas that keeps the tarnish away longer than anything else.

{"text":"I was skeptical, but felt that I needed to try something on my beard, when unconditioned is so coarse it can scrape paint or injure bystanders unlucky enough to brush against it. I am Scottish\/Japanese\/Sicilian, it's like wire growing out of my face. After the first use out of the shower, I could already feel a difference. After using it for a week, I'm convinced that it not only works, but that I will continue to use it. I also started combing my beard with a Kent handmade comb, and it really helps get the oil worked in quickly without a bunch of rubbing. The oil is also great for my skin, I rub it all over my face after I put it on my beard. Huge difference in texture and comfort. Love it. Bonus: My girlfriend loves the way my beard feels, and is always touching it now. Although sometimes she pets it, which is a little weird. My kids like it too, which makes me happy.","label":0}

{"text":"In theory, a carrying case that holds and protects both your laptop and tablet sounds good on paper. Unfortunately, The Case Logic MLA-116 15.6-Inch Laptop and iPad\u00ae Attach\u00e9 fails in both functionality and protection. The MLA-116 is a lightweight case that offers minimal protection to begin with. Protection to your iPad is almost non-existent if you plan on carrying it in the case with your laptop. The interior of the case has an iPad pocket for storage, with basically no protection from it being damaged from contact with the laptop. I won't even attempt to transport both my tablet and laptop together in the MLA-116. Storage is somewhat limited too. You have a pouch on the from which secures with Velcro, and an open pocket on the back of the case. If you want to use the MLA-116 as a lighweight laptop case, it will serve that purpose. But protection is minimal, and the current $45-$50 price tag is just too high for a nylon carrying case. The Case Logic MLA-116 Laptop and iPad\u00ae Attach\u00e9 is described as being \"thickly padded\" with \"spacious storage\". I find this grossly exaggerated, and just not the case. I just can not recommend the Case Logic MLA-116 15.6-Inch Laptop and iPad\u00ae Attach\u00e9 for it's intended purpose of transporting a laptop and iPad all in one case.","label":0}

{"text":"I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT. On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot. So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products. I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often. If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.","label":1}

{"text":"Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles. However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses. Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.","label":1}

I bought this projector brand new in April 2010 and it has been great for four years and now it is not repairable and has less than 2000 hours total. This has been the issue with every Epson I have owned. It seems that Epson projectors are programed to self destruct when the warantee ends in 3 or 4 years. The first two had issues with clouding in the image when the lcds began to fail. I was told that they had cured that problem when I purchased the 8500. This time the lamp overheat lights started flashing and the projector shut itself down and it can't be repaired for less than $1000. This is my last Epson projector and my last lcd projector as well.

{"text":"The best thing I can say is this is relatively inexpensive. My problem is moisture, not particulates - actual water droplets coming through the system. Its been a losing battle to getting these out of my air, and this did not fix that problem. I live in western Washington state and the humidity here is very high, I have an \"array\" of two air filters (counting this) and just added a third filter with an additional desiccant water removal stage. That seems to have done the trick, no more water droplets in my automotive paint. The desiccant is at the end of the filters and the little beads don't last very long, so there is still a lot of moisture coming through the water separators\/filters. The compressor, by the way has an automatic drain on it and is 50' away from the regulator, so I think I've done everything there I can on that end. I am open to suggestions. And this comes with no mounting bracket or way to mount and support it. I have this on the inlet end of things, so that means the air hose is supported by the pipe nipple coming off the outlet with this filter hanging in between.","label":0}

{"text":"I'm an artist, but I also have OA and fibromyalgia. It's really important that I pace myself - but of course, I don't. I got this cute little cube because you don't have to take the time to keep setting it. It's preset to 5, 15, 30, and 45 and you just turn it to the side you want. (As others have stated, each color cube has differing time sequences. I chose white for the 30 and 45 minute increments.) It is quiet. No annoying ticking. And the alarm is loud and not the kind you'll ignore. It definitely will stop you and make you turn the cube to reset. I also love the fact that you don't see any time showing. When I've set other timers, seeing the fact that there are 10 minutes left makes me rush whatever I'm doing to try to finish before the alarm rings. Not with this one. It's very Zen-like and helps you actually forget time but be mindful when it's time to stop. But yes, if you look closely, near the on\/off switch there is a small minute counter.

It made my belly slimmer which I believe has the most stubborn fats on my whole body. 2. It suppressed my appetite so much. I usually eat 3 heavy meals a day and 3 more snack time every time I feel the urge to eat. But after a week of taking it, I already felt full after a heavy meal in the morning, and would just east light meal in the afternoon with no snack time in between because I still feel full. 3. I have experienced no unwanted side effects like dizziness, headache or anything unfamiliar. This really made my life better and I am so thankful that I have found this Extract by Bio Green. I recommend it to everyone who wants to lose weight. - Ana Thorpe, Helen Thorpe's Sister","label":1}

At $80 for a pair, what do you expect? But, on the whole, I'm really pleased. I anticipated them only being good enough to use for public address, but I have recently even been using them for vocals. They aren't as good as a quality wired mic, but they hold their own. They are very cardioid, so you have to stay right on them to be heard. This is not so good if you want to pick up a group of people on one mic, but it really helps eliminate feedback and background noise. The base unit is particularly nice, with both 1\/4\" and XLR balanced outputs, signal level meters and sound level meters, both for each mic. I would definitely buy again.","label":0}

I did some research and found this first, but this was a better deal: http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B0045UF6E6\/ I have been wanting a new pillow for quite a while as I have been waking up with a sore neck and back in the mornings. I decided to give this one a try. After the first night, I was not impressed. It seemed awkward and each time I shifted during the night, I had to think about how I was supposed to position my head. I decided that one night was probably not sufficient test time for this pillow. I have slept on it 5 nights now and I really like it. The support for my back is great and just what I was looking for. The way that it wraps around my head makes me feel cozy and supported. I would recommend this pillow for any side sleepers out there looking for a different, more supportive pillow.","label":1}

{"text":"They taste good. But I'm not so sure about their quality control. In the photo I've uploaded, you can see the size variation between some of the gummies. The larger one is the standard size, but there were quite a few like the stumpy one. I didn't count them, but the product is sold by units rather than weight, so presumably I got less. Not such a big deal I guess, but when you consider that we're only really going by their word as to what's inside the gummies, the lack of quality control on the size doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that the right amount of vitamins and minerals is going into the product. I've noticed issues with their other products too, where this is quite a variation between packages of the same product - some where the gummy is softer, others where it is harder. Some where there is a lot of sugar dusted on them, some where there is very little and they all stick together in a big glob. That said, I continue to buy them because they taste good, they're easy to take, and it's better than nothing. I just wish I could have more confidence in their manufacturing.","label":0}

{"text":"Overkill--akin to protection for kids' tablets: That's exactly what's desired here by many. Beware: The purchaser may obtain exactly what they wish to obtain! Proximity sensor for Kingpad K70 is covered--area at top of this needs tedious cutting out of the thick rubberized material--with scissors or an exacto\/box cutter knife: Not an exact fit for K70, yet workable. Universal fit for many PRC-branded 7\" tabs. Cutout for USB and mini-HDMI exists, also. I protect the tab further with a screen protector and by putting everything everything into an old durable heavy synth-fabric zipper case, as well. Extreme rubberizing makes this product far heavier and bulkier than it may prove otherwise. Provides great protection--until I find something more suitable. May make pocketing, or even purse usage, somewhat more difficult. I'd prefer something thinner-skinned, also rubberized, which hugs the tablet better: This also is a little loose--never to the point at which the tab ever falls out, though. Somewhat difficult to remove the tab--no biggie. Material is so heavy, pulling it outward in order to remove the tab may prove a little more difficult than need be otherwise--no biggie. (It truly is thick and heavily rubberized--never rigid. It's \"springy\"--a very good thing.) This makes 7\" tabs somewhat more unwieldy, heavy, and bulky--even than before--not a good thing. Inducing further clumsiness, this even makes dropping the tab somewhat more likely. It should protect very well then, though--given that the screen doesn't hit something. Pushing buttons isn't as \"tactile\" as with thinner-skinned products. (The key moldings for such buttons do exist, though.) Maybe I'll leave \"skinning\" at this, in the end. Somewhat ambivalent, I feel very confident while handling the tab in its protection. A very safe bet for value 7\" tabs, with mini-HDMI.....","label":0}

{"text":"This dimmer cord helps for those lamps which don't dim on their own and one does not have a dimmer wall switch. My friend has one of these: http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B0000DI241\/  I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.","label":1}

{"text":"If you like mysteries, histories, finances and analyses, business rights and wrongs, you will really enjoy this book. It is fast-paced, the author has a personal stake in this story, which is really two stories, and the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm comes through when he pieces together his well-researched clues to tell the tale of his disappearing great-uncle and the history of his great-uncle's employer, the L.R. Steel Company. Dyer found out where and when Great Uncle Clayton disappeared and reappeared but answers to the mystery of Clayton's behavior are most likely contained within the rapid rise and fall of the L. R. Steel Company and its founder, Leonard Rambler Steel. For history buffs, the book is filled with photos and articles mostly from the early 1920's. It's also a microcosm of lessons-learned like the consequences of hubris and revenue-is-not-profit, lessons that can and should be applied to all of us in our personal lives and to 21st century business practices.","label":0}
{"text":"One of my Christmas gifts, was pretty excited to use it with my iPod Touch, since it was collecting dust after getting an iPad. Followed the directions, downloaded the app, hooked the controller up to my iPod, batteries in, brand new, placed it in the middle of the living room, ready to go and BANG! NOTHING! Contacted Griffin direct, turned out to be a bad remote, wasn't transmitting signals, after a half hour on the phone, they said they would send another one, they did, pooped in on the iPod, and this time, it transmitted signals, now what signals it was transmitting I have no idea, it was so faulty and clumsy even my wife was laughing. Would give zero stars if I could.","label":1}
{"text":"I bought a Belkin cable from Wal*Mart and noticed I kept getting interference across my screen. I then switched power cables (laptop) because I've had this problem in the past with other laptops. Turned out not to be the case- it did the same thing when connecting multiple other pcs and laptops to my screen. I ended up just giving that cable away once I bought this one. No interference whatsoever. I wasn't expecting much from this being that it was cheap but I definitely changed my opinion upon arrival. Inexpensive, sturdy as name brands and works great.","label":0}
{"text":"The Doctor and Leela arrive on a planet about to be hit by a missile and try to get the inhabitants off. However, they find the inhabitants are genetically altered humans on a mysterious scientific project and they're on a planet where killer plants grow in the darkness and kill. The plot here is very suspenseful as we don't quite know the full extent of what's going on. While the basics remain the same, the story has layers that are peeled off as the story continues to unfold until we at last learn the shocking truth. After the last episode ended with an argument between the Doctor and Leela, this story quickly diffuses the situation in a way that felt a little bit too easy. Still, as Leela says, the Doctor had gone days without talking to her which had led her to read more and what she'd read were fairy tales. Leela's pointing out similaritites to Fairy Tale moments. This device works very well throughout the story, creating a little bit of a sense of rythym, being used for occasional comic relief, and in one case actually adding to the terror of the moment (when Leela's reminded of Little Red Riding Hood meeting the wolf disguised as her grandma. It's a wonderfully atmospheric and clever tale featuring great acting and a superb soundscape.","label":0}

It does not show size nor exactly how many fish are around but does show the differing depths the fish are sitting at.

This stand works great for my guitar as well as some of my other string instruments. Its very sturdy and has great grip, so I know that my instrument will stay in place. That's great piece of mind for me. I'm loving it!!!","label":1}
{"text":"this bumper looks exactly like apple bumper for the iPhone 4 and 4s however the material and the finish is not good it feels cheap. I had no problems with the charger while using the bumper as some others reviews, in my case the connector goes all the way with no problems. The volume buttons are hard to press and you need to apply some force for them to work, also the hole for the silent switch it's a bit small if you have big fingers. Overall the bumper provide a good look to the iPhone 5 but it just feels cheap and wrong in your hand.","label":0}

{"text":"This series has everything on it. A great story of scheming and vengeance coupled with historical facts. It has blood and gore which is rarely shown in any series out there today. There is also nudity, there is nothing else you can ask for! The best thing about the series is that they keep on improving their effects. In first season, you could clearly see the fake blood but now, I keep on thinking, how do they do it? It's just that good. There is no series close to what Spartacus has brought into the table. The closest is probably Game of Thrones but Spartacus was the first so you might say it just copied the way Spartacus was going.","label":1}

{"text":"I got this for my boyfriend's 7 year old daughter. She's very much into Barbie right now & doing their hair. The doll comes with a brush, a few curlers, barrettes, pony tail holders & 2 \"irons\" - one regular & one spiral. No heat is needed and they are just plastic. The doll itself comes with a cute outfit and her hair is very long & soft. The curlers are hard to use, they take some force to get them done & undone. I quickly found out that curling the hair takes patience & quite frankly, little girls don't have much of that. Each curl has to be held for 10 seconds. Sometimes it would come out great & other times not so much. The curls don't hold well either. Practice can help but even then, it doesn't look like the photos. Overall, she was happy with the doll since it's a Barbie. The hair curling part, not so much. She continued to play with the hair but think she got bored trying to get it to curl the way she hoped it would. It all comes down to expectations.","label":0}

{"text":"RIEDELL is the go to skate for figure skaters. Because I'm a figure skater I bought these for both of my daughter's. It is very important to have ice skates that support your ankles, these do, as do all Riedells (I believe) You can't get a better pair of skates for beginners than these. You might find 40 dollar skates that look like they will do the job for recreational skating, but you will replace them the next year. These skates have a quality boot and top notch blade. THESE SKATES NEED AN EDGE...They MUST be sharpened before using them. Sharpening a pair of skates is like 5$ and takes 5 minutes. Skates should be tight on the ankles and wiggle room in the toe.","label":0}

{"text":"The benefit of the wispies is that the lashes don't require any scissor trimming to blend naturally to look like your very own. Right out of the box they're beautifully wearable. The color is fantastic. Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don't have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do and are gorgeous with a generous application of mascara to maximize volume, if you desire (which is what I did in my photo). Because these have a spaced out lash line on the band to look like your very own fringe they look somewhat toothy on the lid up close which is easily solved by a swipe of dark shadow or a smokey eyeliner. Once that's done you can't see a thing. Used with Darkness adhesive - excellent stuff - these lashes don't budge a bit. Added bonus: If you carefully wash these off, comb out with a lash brush (or use the edge of a tweezer to separate) and store in your original container you can reuse them, saving money.","label":0}

{"text":"Sharp makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen). Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper. One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you. Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00K69M0TY The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV: This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off. With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung. As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio\/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In\/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio\/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out. Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of thisTV: Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.","label":1}

{"text":"The majority of the people who say negative things about the psp go probably never even touched the thing. I have one and I'm very impressed by it. People, shut the hell up with you shit talk. If your disappointed because the PSN doesn't have all the psp games or because the games are more expensive, I don't blame you. I was disappointed until I found out about a legal way to play all of the psp games on the psp go. No it's not free unless you already have the game you want in UMD format. Buy the game disc, or ask a friend to give you any unwanted psp games. Then, get a CUSTOM FIRMWARE for your psp go. Using custom firmware is completely legal. Next, download the backup files of the games you bought\/ were given. Search up how to play iso's on a psp if you don't already know. Before you start thinking that this is illegal, let me say one thing. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL! As long as you have the original disc (new, used, or even broken for god sake), it is legal to play the backups. Now that way you pay less, and get all the games that were released for the psp. There you have it. Now you have less to whine about, maybe nothing at all anymore. The PSP go is the perfect portable system. You get a massive amount of built in memory space ( perfect for games, music, etc.). The small size is perfect to fit in your pocket. All in all, this is the perfect handheld.","label":0}

My hats off to the folks at Vilso for not only putting out a quality product but also going the distance to be one of the first to offer sound support as well as loaded with all the things needed to make it the best box on the market bar none I have ever used. The box boots up lightening fast and everything flows smoothly as it should. Having the extra GB of memory makes a huge difference. xbmc works better on this box than any of the others I have used. The repos installed have everything one could wish for. I've used this for nearly a month now of hard use and have yet to have the first issue with it.

They look great also but I like them more for the sound, Fantastic Tom head ! Buy a set and see what your toms have been missing ! These Rock ! If you want to hear how they sound, I am including a link of my bands demo ! Great heads ![...]","label":0}

{"text":"This hands-free breastpump bra, is hands down (or up, or really wherever you want them!) the best investment you can make for your pumping efforts -- besides a quality pump, of course. Thus far, I have only been using this bra at home (I go back to work later this week), but I have managed to pump nearly 70 ounces using this bra, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It makes pumping such a breeze, and frees my hands up to do other things (or even just relax). In fact, I'm wearing it and pumping RIGHT NOW, as I type this review at 80 wpm! I use the Ameda Purely Yours, and the flanges fit and hold perfectly. I can't imagine a flange for any pump that wouldn't work. The bra holds the flanges snug and securely against my breast, without being constricting or uncomfortable at all. It feels like I'm just wearing my favorite sports bra. The fabric is very soft and would be comfortable to wear all day, if you wish (and you can add straps to it, to facilitate this). I find it easy enough to throw on over my bra, with the nursing flaps folded down, whenever I'm ready to pump. Sizing the bra was easy. I bought the XS\/S\/M size. I typically wear size Medium or size 10 tops. My bust is a 36D. There's a Velcro panel on the back that you can adjust as much or as little as you need. I have mine attached about an inch from each edge of the piece. There is also an extender piece that zips on\/off in the front, allowing you to make it a little bigger, and also to adjust where the holes are so they line up with where your nipples are. I do not need to use that extender piece. With my sizing, I'd say I'm at the upper end of the size range for the XS\/S\/M size. Regardless, it fits perfectly and comfortably, and I don't see any reason why I'd need to size up. I've been using it for 2.5 months now, and it still looks brand new. The quality and construction are great, and I see no reason it won't last me a long time. I really can't imagine pumping without it. The only time I've ever not used it was when I've used a manual pump, but it's such a drag having to hold the pump against your breast -- I can't imagine trying to double pump without it (and having to hold the flanges onto your breasts with one or both hands -- certainly not relaxing!). It's nice to have your hands free to read a book, fiddle with the switches on the pump, continue doing your work, or even to do breast compressions if you need a little extra help with pumping. And since being relaxed is key to pumping well, this bra makes that so much easier, making it truly a must have!","label":0}

Also, the kit doesn't even come with enough weight to even reach 40 lbs. I weighed all the weights and they equal 38 lbs, which is with the 4 lb bar itself. After getting rid of these I got myself a set of dumbbells I absolutely love. I got them around a month ago and I can't find a single thing to complain about. The max weight and combination of weights included are endless. I'm so happy I bought the set.

The thermos has been turned upside down and on its side in my purse and has never leaked. I have never drank directly from the mug because of fear of burning my lip.

Sent a return request to company because this LNB only gets Satellite 119. Below is one of the responses I got back. A dual lnb means it has 2 outputs. A dual lnb is for connecting 2 receivers to 1 dish, not for connecting one receiver to 2 satellites. It will receive either 118.7 or 119 satellites but not both simultaniously. This was why I asked if you had 2 lnb's. To be able to receive 118.7 and 119 simultaniously you would need 2 of these lnb's on a capable dish, or 2 seperate dishes, one set to 119 and one set to 118.7 Quite technical if you don't know what your getting into...

{"text":"We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water. The watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well. Set-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit. Our plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands. Of course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going. Another consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape. So, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly. We did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants - in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water. Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.","label":0}

The one reason why I chose M\u00fceller over other brands is that I hear\/read so much about how wonderful the costumer service is. I began to read reviews as saw that the owners or at least a representative for M\u00fceller had answered a large majority of the reviews or complaints. That is super impressive to me.

{"text":"This is an expensive joke (as well as a huge waster of space). I bought a ZVOX 450 on the basis of its claims, having never before heard the name, and I had hoped to make dialog more clear -- particularly punch-lines of jokes. The directions claim it only takes 10 minutes to set up, but I spent 2 frustrating hours before calling ZVOX. (To their credit, a live United States citizen answered the phone.) I explained the sound continued to come from the TV speakers as well as the ZVOX causing an echo effect that made most conversation unintelligible. After half an hour he succeeded in turning off the TV speakers off, but then the ZVOX speakers alone didn't sound any better. Plus, the mute button no longer worked, so I could no longer avoid those noisy adverts for pills to avoid all sorts of ailments that no one really wants to hear about incessantly. And certain other functions didn't work either, like the channel-switcher. After three weeks of only half of what I enjoyed before getting the ZVOX, I called it quits and sent the ZVOX back. Then I had no sound on my TV, so I had to call Comcast to repair it. (They gave me a new remote, as the old one had been destroyed in the process of defeating the double speaker problem. And through all of this the sound quality remained the same, with or without the ZVOX. So save your money and a huge piece of space (the ZVOX 450 is REALLY big and heavy).

{"text":"Cello prices are very expensive in the DC area string shops, and many of them are Chinese made (professionally set-up). My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1\/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow. If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3\/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument. The sound isn't as good as my child's 1\/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes. We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound. Good, not great sound enhancement. The E string broke while the adult \"helper\" was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments. Tip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.  I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking. I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune. The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are \"brighter\" sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos. The bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse. Price is the selling point for this cello. The price is right and it is able play after easy set up. Sound is deep and mellow. ***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings.","label":1}

{"text":"I've played the game for 3 months now, and overall I'm just disappointed. The only reason to play this game; it clearly has a large base of players for online multiplayer - including my family and friends. The negatives far outweigh that, however: 1st Player Gameplay The story - as always for COD - is terrible. It's a hodge-podge of random events that happen for a string of characters that I have a hard enough time telling apart, let alone feeling emotion for. No redeeming value here. Multiplayer The multiplayer is very disorganized; most notably in how it ranks players. Unlike other games, any give player is placed in a game with both beginners, and expert players. The game refuses to rank games by skill, and the disparity of player ability is unbelievably frustrating. Visual Teams, opponents, scenery... it all looks the same. Granted, I am moderately color blind, but you can't tell you teammates from your foes until the \"gamertag\" floats above their body. The problem is, that notification above each player is both very difficult to differentiate, and very inconsistent in appearance (if someone runs around an object it often doesn't appear until they are well into the room). System Again, I've been playing for 3 months, however, each time I try to play with my friends (of which we have a group of about 6) we struggle to even get everyone in the same game. The UX is absolutely terrible. We cannot send game invites, we cannot setup parties, and we cannot communicate even after inviting all to a group. It's like the UX was designed by a toddler, I don't know how this passed QA.","label":0}

{"text":"I bought one of these because after the initial $130 or so investment, it was supposed to cost under $5 a month for basic phone service. PROS: It's easy to use. You can use any plug in phone. You can ring your home, and actually reach a family member who may have their cell phone turned off (on purpose or not!). No more \"my phone was on vibrate\" excuses. It has nice features like voice mail. It does free US calling. CONS: Ooma Customer Service. I list it singly, because their customer service, while easy to reach with only a few minutes wait time, act as if when you insist on downgrading to basic service as if the customer would personally reach into the chat room, or across the phone and rip out their lungs, without anesthesia, using dirty pliers. When you sign up, you are automatically place on premier status for a few months. Long enough to forget about it. Then they hit you with the premier bill. The downgrade process to basic service, while not as painful as say, giving birth, or dental surgery, or a parrot bite (you parrot owners know what I'm talking about don't ya!), is still however inconvenient, annoying, and really a turn off for the company in general.","label":0}

{"text":"I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future? Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.","label":1}
{"text":"Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster. I won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this \"biographical\" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man. The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.

{"text":"WOW. The Smith&Stanley Car Escape Tool really does beat all the budget tools out there! This really is a quality product. Yes, it does cost a little bit more, but for a tool that could possibly save your life, I certainly don't have any issues in spending on this tool which works out to be less money than the price of a tank of fuel. And this tool could actually end up saving my life, and whomever I buy it for. This is simply a tool that does its job. It slices the belt faultlessly, and smashes glass effortlessly. I tested it. I figured that a tool like this can't be left to see if it works or not until I'm in an emergency situation. I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews of the other tools are given by buyers who haven't tested the tool. Whilst the negative 1 star poor reviews are given by buyers who've actually tried it out and didn't find what they expected! Yikes! That was a real worry to me. What I like about this tool is that it has the right materials to do the job \u2013 an extremely sharp Titanium blade and a really tough head made of hardened Carbon steel. I looked into this more and found that to break toughened glass you'll need at least something like hardened carbon steel. However, budget tools are mostly made from softer steel. I've tested these and they're pretty useless! Just have a look on YouTube and you'll see people struggling with them. This tool, unlike others, is also approved, tested, and certified by TUV \u2013 I haven't seen this in many tools like this. The certifications and approvals it comes with are certainly worth it in terms of peace of mind knowing that what you've bought has already been approved that it can do its job. I don't know about you, but for me that's a simple check. In summary, I'm very glad I got this tool, and I'm happy to recommend it. However, I would say that before buying yours, check that it can do the job. For a life-saving tool, I really don't think cheap is necessarily thebest option??? Hope that helps and informs.","label":1}

I like the variety of music and white noise, but there seems to be almost too much going on with this toy. Is it really as soothing as it claims? As long as my daughter can't actually see the brightly colored elephant and the toys, it's fine. But she catches a look at it, and it becomes distracting. I rather wish the rings had been left off and softer colors used. Back to the white noise... is this really white noise or just static? It does not seem to be as sound blocking as other white noise makers I've heard. The lullabies are fine and white noise is soothing enough, but this almost seems to be a glorified happy-fun-playtime noisemaker.","label":0}

This has shiny flat areas on each link (diamond-cut) that make it look very sharp. However, it is not so large as to detract from the silver pendant I put on it.

{"text":"(This is for the Double Choco Espresso variety.) Years ago, I bought and really enjoyed the squares. I'd read some reviews that the bars were smaller, more expensive, and not as good now that Earnest took over, but I decided to give them a try. Maybe I went with the wrong variety, but the Double Choco Espresso squares that I received are really dry. Not crunchy and stale, mind you, but \"moist\" isn't a word that would even remotely enter your mind upon taking a bite, unless is was prefaced by \"wow, these sure aren't.\" It's like being in a real life \"Got Milk\" commercial. The flavor is okay (not great, but okay), but the dryness is really off putting, and they are quite small. Given the current price of over $1\/bar for these (and over $1.50 for some of them), I'd recommend passing. For a while now, I've been eating (I've tried and liked the fig and raspberry flavors). For similar calorie count with less fat and about half the price of these, I suggest giving those a try if you're looking for an easily packed snack.","label":0}
{"text":"I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn't quite for one reason - the buttons. To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room. To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace. The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern. The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room. So those don't get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes. So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well. The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED's now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I'm in just fine. But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don't provide enough light. That's about the only time I usually turn on the others. I thought if I had a remote for them, I'd be more likely to use them when needed for other things. This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location. The others were just too bulky to fit within the \"standard\" box the builders used here for the wall switch. This is the first that fit, and it didn't even have to be crammed in there. It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer. The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more. Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on. The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote. It works well. I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness. The \"favorite\" raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time, The remote is responsive and accurate - I've not had any misfires. Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons. I really hate the feel of them. There's a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions. So it always feels like it's about to come loose or something. They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges. The other downside is that there is no \"favorite\" or \"last\" setting for the wall switch itself. I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that's just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch. This one doesn't have the same functionality unfortunately. My other wishlist item would've been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark. But the LED's are only on if the light is on. The whole \"raised icon\" to \"easily find in the dark\" really seems pretty useless to me - if you've already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you've ALREADY found the switch... Apparently the CFL's I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off. This wouldn't even work with them as a simple on\/off switch. But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED's, as these were the only cans left that I hadn't swapped to LED yet. But as I said, this is the first switch I've tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall. It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.","label":0}

{"text":"LOTS of power. So much power. My husband charged his android phone to 75% (because he then had to use the thing), I charged my iPhone 5S multiple times, and we're still on the first charging. It managed to charge overnight. I had my iPhone going at full tilt (Waze was running, as well as YouTube, and LTE turned on) on my trip on the bus. I was teetering on 20% battery life. In an hour, while using my phone with all the things running, I managed to get back up to 75% battery while plugged into the 2 amp side. The battery amount left over display is really helpful, because those freaking dots that other battery backups have don't tell you anything. We own a that I've had for a couple of years now. Look at the price on that thing, and compare it to the price for the TSST one. It's night and day, isn't it? The amount of mAh on this one isn't that far behind the NewTrent one, but this one costs like half of the other one. Might as well buy two of these if you need that much battery charge. It is heavy though (like a pound or so), so if you're one of those people who hates carrying extra weight, then you'll be stuck with a lower capacity battery, because the amount of charging you get out of this sucker is very good. You can't have it all, can you? Either you sacrifice the amount of charge you get, or sacrifice having a heavy little brick in your bag. This is thicker and slightly larger than my iPhone, but it's small enough to fit into a regular sized handbag or backpack. It does fit into my pocket for those times that I want to talk on the phone while having the phone charge, and walk around (you'd be surprised how frequent that occurrence happens). When I do so in my pyjamas, it will bang against my leg, so I make sure to just slide the battery thingy into the pocket of my hoodie or something. For what you're paying for the unit, this is a very slick little device. It's got sensible features that you will find yourself wishing in all your other devices. It's also pretty enough that other people comment on it. Very much worth the money.","label":0}
{"text":"It took me an hour to finally install Ooma Telo on a place where my phone was. I didn't think of calling a support because I read here that they were not that helpful. Once I installed it, I called a friend just to see if it works ( prior to that I had to activate product through their website, which was an annoying process). However, friend told me that he couldn't hear me well and that he noticed a repeat of every word I say. I didn't knew what happened, since I updated software online to the newest version, so we changed places and I got onto his phone and he on Ooma. I noticed the same thing, low volume and slight delay, which really ruined the whole experience. At last I returned the item and made a fair exchange... I got myself a new Telo Home Service ( http:\/\/amzn.to\/1vBqHZ5 ), which wasn't malfunctioned. I did had slight problems in installing it but I solved it as it wasn't a factory mistake.

{"text":"There is no other solution that enables you to do live broadcast video streaming to the web for under $500, but be prepared to deal with many shortcomings: 1. Battery performance is BAD. A set of good rechargeable AA batteries barely makes it an hour or so, so you'll want to have it plugged into an external power source if shooting a lengthier event... if you have to change batteries mid-shooting, it takes a solid 2 minutes to swap and reboot and rejoin your broadcast. 2. 4G modem support is BAD. They list some models, and we went with a supposedly supported Verizon model, but it wouldn't connect as a 4G modem. And tech support is basically non-existent. There's not even a user's manual... It's a figure-it-out-as-you-go product that is mostly easy, but quirky. What DID work reliably, however, was setting up a Verizon mobile hotspot and having the Broadcaster connect to the 4G modem over WiFi. 3. Small display... if your Livestream events all start with the same beginning words, you won't be able to see which one you want to select when setting up your stream, so it forces bad naming behavior on your events.

{"text":"The game itself is brilliant and after playing the game on the Xbox One for over 20 hours I come home excited to sink more time into the game. THAT is the game side - however the console I am playing it on is so weak that it cannot carry this games empty grocery bags. Going to limit my ramblings to 3 items - Controls - Frame rate - Graphics. Controls - they changed the control scheme a little from the Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360 so that may upset some. They are slightly clunky and take some getting use to but it can be done. Frame rate - ONE WORD - HORRIBLE - the time I spent playing I always end up with watery eyes and a slight head ache. The frame rate and motion blue and resolution changes are hard on the eyes. The rate often jumps down into the 20s which feels like someone punched you right in the eyes. It's frustrating and even though its probably a little bit of optimization lack luster on the games part - the console is just to weak for this game. When you rotate the character the amount of motion blur in the draw distance is laughable, it turns into one big generic blur with no detail at all. If I didn't have a vested interest in the Gamerscore I would have not even bought this weak DDR3 all in one Xbox One. I think the frame rate drops are attributed to the dynamic resolution changes but for the love of eye sight, kill the dynamic resolution and pick a standard and stick with it. Even if its low settings its better then eye gouging frame rate stutter. Graphics - Beautiful - very detailed with overly done wind effects on trees. If they cut back on the wind effects alone I think they could have put that into the frame rate. The draw distance is immaculate but as soon as your rotate your character it disappears into a massive blur, its the worst I have ever seen. I am just an Xbox fan boy who is hating because my system of choice is such a wimp - DDR3 are you kidding me!!!","label":0}

This means that if they brush up against something, like the collar of my shirt (where I often hang them), they can easily come off. And when they do, well, you better hope you can find them, or else you have a rather uncomfortable pair of sunglasses. I lost one of the nose pads this way a few weeks ago. (Somewhat) fortunately, they included another set of pads, only these were a different shape and, to my mind, much less comfortable. Alas, one of those recently came off and was lost.

However, if I was to get it for myself (the 46 mil size is a bit out of my comfort zone) I would change the strap, not because of what has been said. but because I saw pictures of a strap one customer had put on the watch and it just popped it.","label":0}
{"text":"This snorkel, like all Cressi products, is of the best quality, and has a great price. When I order a new snorkel I normally have to check the mouth piece and make sure that aren't any sharp edges that need to be filed down, but I never have to do that with Cressi, they are made differently than other brands. This snorkel is very comfortable and doesn't leak when submerged, in addition, it clears very quickly and easily when you come up.","label":1}

{"text":"Form: The TV has a red-Formica-chrome look of the fifties. I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier. Function: I had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics. The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p. Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good. It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection. The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set. Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV. Bottom line: If you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you. If you're looking for a small TV (with headset connection) for your kitchen ,kids room or dorm room you might want to keep looking. note: After re-reading this review I can see I didn't add much helpful information for the TV but everything has been so competently and completely covered I don't know what I could have added. It would have been helpful it there was a back view of the TV on the product page, showing all the connections, but I'm here to review the TV not the advertising method.","label":0}

Sadly, it wasn't what I expected and I felt guilty about spending so much on it. The picture quality wasn't good as I expected being LED and it would randomly shut off at different times for no apparent reason, no matter where I plugged it in. Overall I just wasn't happy. I dealt with that and did some research so I could find myself a monitor I could be confident would be sufficient for what I was looking for and worked properly. The one I found is absolutely amazing, I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over a month of using it. The picture quality is amazing and everything I've watched or done looks great. If you want a quality monitor, please get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------> http:\/\/amzn.to\/1z0owSc You won't regret getting it, it's by far the best monitor I've ever used.

{"text":"This is my first universal remote, so I can't compare it to others, but I'm amazed by how well it works. It has its quirks and it doesn't always do what it's supposed to do, but I happily take this over having multiple remotes. The Help feature on this remote is amazing and while others might consider it a nuisance to have to rely on it, I think it's a blessing. Setting up the remote was complicated at first, but I was able to figure it out after a few tries without reading up on it, though there are still a few functions I'm still not clear on. Logitech customer service is also great. The only device I've tried that this device isn't compatible with is the Amazon Fire TV. You'll need a hub-based remote for that functionality. The learn function also works well. The remote itself is fairly lightweight and feels comfortable. Keep in mind that you have to sync the remote after any change you make to the settings, and syncing isn't wireless. The included usb cable is required. It only gets tiresome if you're constantly changing the settings or configuration of your home entertainment setup. Edit 9\/20\/15: Unfortunately, I have to change my good review. After a few months, this remote has become increasingly frustrating. It was at the point where I couldn't do anything at all without the help button. It wouldn't switch to the correct devices. It even stopped turning on my TV. I finally spoke with a tech support person who spent a lot of time fixing the issue. It's now better, but still has its glitches. I wouldn't recommend.","label":0}

{"text":"Like several other reviewers I'd been using SM58's until trying these out and was blown away. We use these for vocals in both a rehearsal studio environment and live performance. They run thru dbx 286A preamp\/compressor\/gates in normal use but when we got the first one I a\/b tested it against the Shure straight into the console as well. Here's my rundown: * sonically they have wider response, just a little bit more at the bottom and noticeably more extension at the top. To my ears it's slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off. * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58's. On the other hand, our singers have to remember to sing more directly into the mic. Minimal proximity effect as well. Plosives are well controlled, about the same as the Shure. * sturdy construction, minimal handling noise, good weight balance, feels slightly heavier than the 58. * first reaction when the band saw them was \"ooo sexy\". I dunno about sexy but it IS a nice looking mic. Overall these are a nice improvement. I have now replaced my 58's with e835's and could hardly be happier with the results. Microphone qualities are highly subjective so listen to both back to back if at all possible, and decide for yourself! The e835 may not be right for you but in my case have exceeded expectations.","label":0}

{"text":"Okay so had this wheel for a couple weeks. Bottom line is its plastic so you hear the spinning whapping sound, the pitter patter of their feet and the most annoying is it wobbles making a banging noise because there's a great deal of space between the cage and the actual wheel. Note that's in the large version. When my girls take off in full gallop the wobbling wheel bangs on the backside of the cage its unbearable. So 4am when i couldn't take it anymore i walked to the kitchen grabbed some pam and sprayed the wheel and realized i attached it upside down initially so that decreased all the noise by like 50% but, i have to say im disappointed by the product and i can sleep with some slight noise. The other members of the house actually was told get up walk over to close my bedroom door at night due to the noise. Then the urine collects in it i have to wipe it down and when it came in the package there was three sharp areas on the outside of the wheel that i had to buff down with a nail filer because im sure my girls could cut themselves. My metal grid wheel lubricated was completely silent to the point that i thought they stopped using the wheel but, they haven't. I got this one because of the danger of owning a mesh wheel. Have to say if it wasn't for their safety i wouldn't order this one. An another note my girls love it. They go nuts over this thing full speed full gallop. I have two rats and only one used to use a wheel now they both go crazy in this thing. I guess 5 stars from rats. Meh three stars for me. Update: Returning it! ugh so bad I'm so upset. Went to wipe it down and the wheel fell right of the wall of the cage! I didn't even put that much pressure worst of all the piece that secure the wheel to the cage was still attached to the cage!! WHAT THE HECK there a mid black plastic clip that clips to the wheel and then snap clips to the other piece that secures the wheel to the cage! I'm sorry but that just makes no sense and totally unsafe. Really whats the purpose of securing the wheel to the cage if it just snaps on to the securing piece with little tiny shallow hook to hole plastic snap mechanism. Which doesn't even hold no matter how hard i click it in. while i tried to attach it to the cage the wheel falls off the clip. I think one of the hooks is bent and doesn't snap tightly anymore. I don't understand if it was for the purpose of faster cleaning but i rather unscrew the cap of to release it and know that its tight and secure when i attach it. Doesn't take that much longer. Jeez One gallop and one of my rats would of flew off the wheel with the wheel along with her! Now it wont snap back on properly so even then i was willing to use the stupid stand nope its tilted and wobbles so much. Why is this thing so unstable?? This wheel is not worth 10$. Included a short video to show what i mean. Don't know if i'm doing something wrong but either way doesnt attach anymore and i'm very disappointed.","label":0}

{"text":"I rated Fisher Price Little People set 4 stars because it is a cute musical preschool play set. I am generally happy with all the Little People sets I have and this is a great addition. I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table\/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting! The magical color rug doesn't really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; \"It's time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!\" I didn't rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I'll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a \"new\" feeling toy. Overall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play. If your looking to add to your current collection or just start one of Little Poeple play sets, this is a good one!","label":0}

The shake lacks that coffee flavour i wanted, and is just way too sweet to drink. The shake also has that chalky texture, but not flavour as you can't taste anything over the sweetness. For me, the nutritional benefits just cant outweigh the taste. Perhaps if they lowered the sweetness and upped the coffee flavour, I'd give it another go.","label":0}

{"text":"I had a rocky start with the Gatorskin, catching 3 rear flats in the first 3 weeks after putting these on (they were all legit flats; 2 goathead thorns and 1 bit of wire probably blown out of car radial tires) last October. Since then I've had only 2 flats in 7 months, though, and I ride through a lot of broken glass debris in the streets of San Diego, CA. The Gatorskin is thick and heavy, but then I ride aluminum roadie, so I don't mind a few extra ounces. New tire takes a bit of kneading to get on, but if you knead it right you don't need to use tire levers to help. The PSI info on the tire is pretty hard to read (it's obscured by the yellow thread on the sidewall), but mine list max PSI at 120. I'm pretty light (130 lbs), though, and usually run them between 85-90 PSI for softer riding and lower rolling resistance. Never had pinched flat on them and they run great. The rear Gatorskin developed 'square top' after about 1000 mile or so. 750 miles later it is still working well and has plenty of meat left (and I've been riding off road a bit with my road bike... They've gone up Nate Harrison Grade, Black Canyon Rd, and Mother Grundy Truck Trail without much problem (they do skid when you climb 14% grade ramps on loose gravel, but that's about it). I don't rip it down curvy mountain roads because I'm aware of the squared top rear tire and the tires handle just fine down things like Palomar South Grade Rd or Mesa Grande Rd or Honey Springs Rd. Bottom line: I got these tires for their hardiness and they are indeed very hardy. They were pretty sticky when new, but that wore off within a week or two. Now they grip fine on normal road condition and even when the road is a bit wet (I go safely slow when wet, though, so I don't know how they do if you want to race with them in wet weather).","label":0}

{"text":"You'd think after the Halloween 4 mess in the expensive Halloween boxed set, they would get it right in the Nightbreed boxed set, which us UBER expensive if you consider it's only 3 discs of ONE movie. I purposely went for the boxed set to get both the director's cut AND the theatrical cut on Blu-ray so I could upgrade my theatrical from the DVD. But when I watched the Blu-ray of the theatrical cut, instead of the 5.1 audio track that was promised on the back of the box, I could only get a 2-channel stereo track. Knowing my DVD of the movie has a 5.1 track, I figured maybe there was a problem with my Blu-ray. So I posted my issue on the Scream Factory facebook page, and they were kind enough to respond to the post: Sorry but there is not a 5.1 track on the theatrical cut on all discs. We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed. The misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience. As much as I appreciate all the work Scream Factory does bringing rare films or cuts of films to Blu-ray, it really disappoints when it doesn't deliver on the easiest part--giving the best possible features when they are already available elsewhere!","label":0}

As these stairs are never used, I placed the base legs of the stand on one of the wider bottom steps and leaned it against the wall. The top bar that leans against the wall has a soft rubber\/plastic cushioning pad - so it makes no marks on the wall.

Connected through an OTG cable, it is immediate recognition. A slight twitch will instantly bring my tablet out from sleep mode. Long cord, at least six feet. Smooth, sensitive trackball. The right button seems contextual, but it brings up the additional menu options that I get when I long press a song or soft-button.n Left and bottom buttons act as the typical selection click. I haven't noticed any particular power drain from this, so I suspect it may be a lesser milliamp pull than a typical wired USB mouse.

I don't know how they react to the ornamental type, but I know they stay away from the wild stuff. I lived in a tent in Colorado for two years and with the spring thaw...mosquitoes in swarms too big to believe would be on the hunt. I remember reading about yarrow of which there was plenty growing wild up there and started picking the flower heads and putting them in my button holes. The swarm would follow in a cloud a couple feet from my head, but wouldn't come closer. They never bit. It isn't smelly stuff so I am not sure why they avoid it, but they do.

{"text":"I approached this movie with huge anticipation. The director, Jee-woon Kim, has directed some PHENOMENAL Korean movies. The cinematography in his movies I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad, and the Weird is simply some of the best cinematography I've seen in any movie anywhere (American movies included). If you don't mind subtitles (and you shouldn't) check both of those out. So I was excited that Mr. Kim's American debut was going to be Arnold's return to the big screen. The previews looked promising and fun. But something about the movie just felt...off. None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters. it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent. Overall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim.","label":1}

It's not supposed to be a complete set, but when you do buy one, you can have up to four players with the internet. So, I think it's worth your while if your kids are really into this gaming thing.

{"text":"The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym. Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months. If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine. I am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95. The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars. If that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - . So, that is a good price, a great price actually. Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!? While I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase. I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol. Key Feature #1: The Wheel size is very very wide. This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning. The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement. This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker. When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one. TIP FOR BEGINNERS: Start on a wall, no kidding. Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30. Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)! Key Feature #2: The Contoured handles really help with different angles. Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time. The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!). The only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my \"home gym\" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt. I went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one; . My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one. If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while! I went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now. Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap. They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart. I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general. I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes. I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow. I love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits. I hate the word diet, so I'll use \"healthy eating habits\". These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat. And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!","label":1}

{"text":"I purchased this in December and we have gotten a lot of use out of these DVD players! I recently purchased a longer AV cable because the way we configured it in the car with one player in the second row and one in the back we needed a longer cable to be able to tuck it away and not have to trip over the cord whenever the kiddos got in and out of the car. With that adjustment it works beautifully. Everything as far as the players are concerned has been working great until this last car trip one of the player's doors will not latch securely so at the slightest jar or bump it will flash \"open\" on the screen and stop playing. This is not a huge deal since we always watch with them connected anyway it just required a simple DVD swap. Like I said we use them a lot and I have four little girls under the age of 7 with access to the buttons so I'm not blaming the machine. The video quality is perfect for what we use them for, the sound is great, maybe a little too great we usually turn off the sound on the player mounted behind the driver's head and leave the other one on so my husband and I can have a conversation in the car. I am not in love with the buttons to control play and pause and skipping chapters, they are very small and it is very easy to push the wrong one and start rewinding instead of playing. As long as I set the whole movie up before we head out it is usually no big deal but as far as controlling the units themselves it's too tricky for the four year olds who are the main DVD player controllers. All in all if you are debating about purchasing this item I did some serious homework on it and am very satisfied with this purchase. When these die (eventually) I would buy a second set in a minute.","label":0}

{"text":"I purchased ths bag for a safari trip in Kenya over christmas and new year 2012 \/2013 This was my bag for the two week camping trip and it held all the clothes etc. I needed and I used it as carry on on some flights and checked in on others. It was not treated very well being stuffed in the back of land rovers etc. The only thing that failed was one of the metal feet came off at some stage (the central one). Other than that it hed up well and will definatley be my go to bag for trips. My only criticism of the bag is the metal \"feet\" which are only held on by what appears to be a split pin type device which can be felt on the interior of the bag and will wear through as they are not well covered on the interior. Other than that great bag for the price and they are up to real world traveling.","label":0}

{"text":"So here was my predicament: I didn't really wanted to have a Wii U. I thought I had grown out of my Nintendo phase. The last Nintendo system I had was the GameCube more than 10 years ago, and I hardly ever played it. Gone were the heyday of my Super Nintendo and Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and Bomberman after-school parties. Then one day while reading up on my video game news, I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda. I swore I had never seen anything more beautiful, and instantly I was hooked. I don't remember the last time ONE game made me want to buy a game console right away. So I sought out to see which \"set\" I would buy. The standard basic and deluxe sets were out of the question, and I saw this one. Then I read up on the Mario Kart 8 set, which is supposed to be sold for $330. I searched furiously all over the Net for it. I even wrote scathing reviews for those sets on Amazon, because for some reason Amazon doesn't sell them, and worse yet, let those marketplace sellers run their mark-up scams and sell it for over $400. After two weeks and no luck - Walmart, BestBuy, GameStop, and even Toys R' Us didn't have them in stock anymore - I had to resort to buy this set from my local BestBuy. Here is my scenario to give you the best value, as of this writing - July 12, 2014. I have included direct links to the products for quicker access. 1) Get this set for $300. Get it from other online stores if you have to. The cheapest Prime seller on here is $305. 2) Buy Mario Kart 8 for $49-(). This game comes with a code to get you one of four free games. Since Pikmin 3-() is the most expensive right now - $50 - save that for the free game. 3) If you want the Wii controller that's included in the Mario Kart set, buy Wii U Party for $43-(), which includes the controller. 4) Buy the () for $9. Optional: 5) Buy Zelda: Wind Waker HD for about $41-(). The Wonderful 101 is only $24(). Super Mario 3D World is $49-(), and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is $44-(). All of these games mentioned are the cheapest prices(here on Amazon) for a big online store. 6) If you want the Wii U Pro controller, get the Japanese import version, which saves you about $10($40)-(). It's the exact same as the US one, only with Japanese documentation. If you do my method, it would cost you $400 for the whole set, which includes Mario Kart 8, Wii U Party, and the Wii controller and wheel add-on. This is $70 more than the Mario Kart set, but then you don't have to wait until who knows when for that set to be available again, plus you gain Super Mario Bros U\/Super Luigi U that comes with the Deluxe Set, and Wii U Party, which make up the price difference. You can resell those two extra games if you don't want to keep them. Hope that helps! Good luck! *As of the Wii U itself, I love, Love, LOVE my Wii U! I can finally relive my childhood past. The included Mario\/Luigi games bring back the nostalgia of the original Nintendo, only this time the graphics are soooo gorgeous. I can just stare at it all day while a friend plays it. I also bought Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and the Wonderful 101, and all have been a joy and a blast to play, each in their unique way. The feeling the Wii U gives you is night and day different than my PS4 or PC. While the other two systems offer the mature entertainment my grown-up phase has moved on to, there will always be a place in my heart for Nintendo games, and the Wii U provides allthat for me, and in spades. Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was right when he said \"Nintendo\" is its own unique genre. Nowhere else can you get games like the Mario games, Mario Kart, the Yoshi\/Toad\/Kirby\/Donkey Kong games. More importantly, they all have their own unique style and feel that no other games can give you. You can read more about that article at [nintendolife.com\/news\/2014\/06\/miyamoto_thinks_that_nintendo_are_in_a_genre_of_their_own]. The closest recent game that can even say to be similar that's available across all systems is Rayman. And then there's the eNintendo shop, which further allows you to play those legacy games in their original state. So far I've bought The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past, and The Minish Cap, and both have been awesome to play, and is almost exactly how I remembered it. And finally, there's a rewards system on Club Nintendo where you earn points for registering your games and systems. These points then can be used to redeem for free games. And then, if you reach 300 points, you will be at Gold status, which would earn you further freebies at the end of the Nintendo year (June 30 of each year), and 600 points gets you to Platinum status. I registered my Wii U, Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and The Wonderful 101, and I'm already at Gold level! For more info, you can check out [club.nintendo.com\/elite-status-gifts.do]. If you were holding off on buying a Wii U - like me - well, now is the perfect time to get back into it, especially with Mario Kart just coming out, plus all those great games coming at the end of the year and next year, like the aforementioned upcoming Legend of Zelda. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!","label":0}
{"text":"This Procella 62 inch golf umbrella is a great value. My gold standard umbrella is a 68 inch Gustbuster Titleist branded umbrella. The Procella stacks up well in comparison, and is less expensive. The Procella umbrella has some great features - the handle is rubberized beefy, with a golf grip style pattern. With one button press the umbrella shoots open - a super nice feature when it starts raining and you want to get under the umbrella quickly. This is a double canopy umbrella, meaning the top two thirds of the umbrella are covered with a second layer. That second layer is vented to the main canopy. Inside the umbrella mesh covers the opening between the two layers - this is super nice because it improves the strength of the fabric. Those are features the Procella has that are better than the Gustbuster. The Procella weighs a half pound less than the Gustbuster (1 pound 8 ounces to 2 pounds). I guess you could get an extra beer in your golf bag for the weight savings - advantage Procella. Both have similar sewing and cloth for the canopy - neither is perfection. They are both pretty close to the same length (the Gustbuster is about 6 inches longer, but that's really negligible), and are the same diameter when wrapped up closed (they both fit in a standard golf bag umbrella holder). The Gustbuster is a bigger umbrella (well you knew that, 62 inches versus 68), the difference is actually more significant than you might imagine. You will probably never get wet underneath either umbrella, but that extra six inch diameter and deeper dome might come in handy. Slight advantage Gustbuster. They both have sturdy spines or skeleton. The Gustbuster went with a single spar and used a thicker material. Procella went with smaller spars and a second support rod. Don't think one is really that much better than the other - they will both work. The Gustbuster has two big differences. The first one is price; it is a lot more expensive. When I wrote this review the Procella is selling for $35 and I paid $65 for the Titleist umbrella. Gustbusters can be purchased without a brand on them for around $50. Huge advantage for Procella. The second big difference is the upper canopy, and this may or may not be worth all the extra money. Gustbuster added elastic hold down strips to the upper canopy. If there is a really strong wind, the upper canopy can actually lift away from the umbrella allowing more air to flow through the umbrella. That little tiny difference could be the difference between the umbrella flying away and keeping ahold of it. I'm not sure how frequently that would come into play - it might be so nasty out at that stage, you should be in the clubhouse anyway (or have on rain gear). The Procella I was sent for testing is a blue and white umbrella. I like the look a lot, the blue is a nice deep royal blue and the company name and logo is printed in black on a white section. The umbrella looks handsome - my wife said she wouldn't hesitate to grab this umbrella; she would leave the Titleist behind - too much golf logo for her taste. Oh it is a onetime thing; the box the umbrella came in is really pretty. This arrived in the middle of winter and the picture around the box is a beautiful blue sky with a perfectly placed golf ball on some fairway grass. Yes, that's what dreams are made of. The Procella golf umbrella is a great reasonably priced alternative to more expensive umbrellas. And because it is that much lighter than the others, you can get an extra beverage in your bag for the same weight.","label":0}

Since buying it, I've been transporting it between other systems in the house. Audio quality seems to be pretty good--not as good as a direct connection, but this is all about convenience. What really shines is its ability to easily pair with other devices. I find this receiver with no problems using the Bluetooth built into my laptop. But with my phone, all I need to do is tap the top of this device with my phone; the phone then enables its own Bluetooth connection, and pairs automatically. (The magic of NFC, aka near-field communications.) With such easy pairing, and good sound quality, I can't rate this any less than five stars. It has worked flawlessly for me in the time that I've owned it, and plan on buying at least two more of these in the near future.","label":0}

{"text":"Shopping for a camera can be overwhelming when you take into consideration all the mixed reviews about point-and shoot cameras. So, I decided to purchase one that was small to keep from wasting too much money on a camera that would not produce. After all, most of the rave reviews are given to very large and expensive cameras. It was time to see if a mini camera could produce what it promised, and I felt like I had nothing to lose. This pocket camera proved to be an excellent choice. It has excellent shutter speed, very fast recovery in between shots, 10x zoom capability, low light capability, macro capibility, and nice video quality. In other words, it does exactly what you'd expect a \"point-and-shoot\" camera to do: take great pictures. However, it doesn't work well with the flash, and it has a very dark quality when recording video in low light. If you can handle using small flush buttons and going through multiple menu items to erase a picture or toggle between manual and automatic pictures, then it's worth your while. After all, anyone wanting a compact camera is not asking for professional photography. You just want something that's easy to carry that will also take good pictures. This camera hits the mark.","label":1}

{"text":"Read the reviews and was leery that I, too, might end up with a lemon. But I didn't want to invest excessively on a tv, and I wanted an LED to conserve energy (I live off-grid on solar power). Knew the sound would be lacking. However, I am quite satisfied with this tv. The picture is very good at normal viewing distance (beyond 3 ft- I sit about 10 ft back). Set up was easy. Very light- mounted it on the wall by myself. Slim profile. The speakers are weak. But I hooked up some cheap computer speakers and it is quite fine. Watched playoff football and quite happy with the picture of fast motion. Good price for a good product. I've only had it 2 weeks- others have said it wouldn't turn on suddenly after owning it for a month. I'll see. Because I got the tv reasonably inexpensive from my local appliance store (they met the Best Buy and Amazon price), I bought a 2 yr extended warranty to cover my leeriness over quality, so they will take care of any problems locally and I don't have to deal with shipping it back. Great product.","label":0}

{"text":"Built-in pump is the best part of this bed, as it cuts down on packing load. We use it for camping and for houseguests. The bed takes a day or so of refilling to get it to keep full air for any amount of time after that. It is just because the material stretches after sleeping on it. Packing it in is tough, the deflation setting won't get all of the air out once it sucks the material into it.","label":0}

This is one of the few antiaging products I can use (no nut oils or super active ingredients). Highly suggest for sensitive skin. Things I have noticed: - more even skin tone - moisture!!! (I live in the desert, my skin flakes non stop) - radiance - the smell (nice mint) - NO BREAKOUTS (this is a VERY big issue for me and lotions\/moisturizers)","label":1}

{"text":"If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone. Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work. Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her? Will he be able to stop drinking? Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job? Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico? In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods. In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real. Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease. You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself. The secondary characters are strong. You don't feel like you are watching a show. You feel like it's real life. And you care about the characters. Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances. This is the kind of series you could watch every year. Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode. We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.","label":0}
{"text":"I use my LED desk lamp almost every night. I really love its modern and minimalist look. It just feels so high tech. The round base barely takes up any space on the end table at the side of my bed. I like that it can fold up when not in use. The three light color options come in handy depending on my mood and the five dimming levels allow for several brightness options throughout the day. The light feels really natural and doesn't flicker at all. The rating on the LED bulb life expectancy means I shouldn't have to replace the bulb for at least a couple decades! One of my best buys on Amazon!","label":1}

{"text":"What a wreak - literally. We have a shipwreck, a love affair on the rocks, people trying to run other's lives when they can't run their own. Ross in deep in debt with Warleggan liking nothing more than to crush him. Julia is born and the apple of her parents eye. Verity Poldark & Andrew Blamey want forever and Francis say no. Mark & Karen Daniels and Dr. Enys - oh my! Affairs, Bitterness, christening, deceit, envy, folly, gambling, hunger, illness, jealousy, kindness, lies, murder, oppression, parties, quarrels, revelry, snobs, violence. And in the end a beautiful moment of hope. Totally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters. I eagerly gobbled up the first 4 books 1945 - Ross Poldark 1946 - Demelza 1950 - Jeremy Poldark 1953 - Warleggan I stopped reading the series in 1977 as the novels had gotten so dark that I wasn't enjoying where the author was taking the characters. 1973 - The Black Moon 1976 - The Four Swans 1977 - The Angry Tide I was poking in a book store on vacation and picked up 'The Twisted Sword' and enjoyed it tremendously (with one exception - I didn't care for the outcome for Jeremy at all). It was so good seeing Zacky Martin & Mrs. Zacky, Tholly Tregolis, Jud & Trudy Paynter - they hadn't changed at all. Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey. And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character. And Cornwall, Nampara (the Ross Poldark home) Wheal Grace and Wheal Leisure all so familiar 40 years later. 1981 - The Stranger from the Sea 1982 - The Miller's Dance 1984 - The Loving Cup 1990 - The Twisted Sword 2002 - Bella Poldark I am not sure I will pick up the last book as from the the reviews I don't think I will enjoy it as much. The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 soit is truly the last written by him. From the publisher: Demelza, the miner's daughter that Poldark rescued from a fairground rabble, is now his wife. Demelza's efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry bring her confusion and heartache, despite the joy in the birth of their first child. Additionally the seeds of dispute with Warleggan are sown. Also from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget.","label":0}
{"text":"This unit is great by itself, but I almost think two are necessary. Not because it isnt bright or doesn't fill up a lot of space, it does both of those things well. But with two lasers you're able to provide a real light show, switching between all the features allows for some trippy effects. Definately recommend the product, and if you like it, I'd suggest looking into ADJ's other lasers like the Royal or Hypnotic Web to make a legit setup. I had the green laser go out on my product within the 3 month warranty time frame and ADJ replaced the unit within a few weeks. Their customer service was very easy to work with and polite.

After all, you only want what's best for your skin. The Epique has a very light feeling to it once it is applied to your skin, has an amazing smell. Most anti aging creams I have used in the past leave my face feeling sticky and feel like nothing is becoming of these high dollar creams. NOT Epique, I love this. With in just a few short days.

So this is the best pair I have so far.","label":0}
{"text":"I bought this drop leg holster because I wanted a versatile platform that would accomodate several pistols with or without lights. I like the fact that it can also be used as a belt holster or attached to a vest. Pro: Versatile, holds pistol without light somewhat securely (read cons), durable materials, very good craftsmanship Con: You do have to set up the holster to fit your size and weapon. Not really a con but rather a fact. However, the instruction manual to set up the holster is lacking. The technical writer needs to be smacked in the back of the head. Clearer diagrams would have been helpful. Once you figure it out, the set up is not too bad if not a bit finicky. The holster IS bulky. I have a Bladetech Revolution holster attached to a Bladetech drop leg platform and it has a narrower profile. I wanted a drop leg that you could roll around on the ground with. I scratched up the Kydex on the Bladetech doing this. While the material is very durable it's also quite stiff. It'll probably soften up with use. I can't seem to get the bellows that accomodates the light to close down enough to prevent the pistol from rocking a bit fore and aft(the pistol doesn't have a light attached). Addendum: I had to return this holster due to the retension strap snap not being strong enough and the bellows being too loose. The rocking of the pistol fore and aft became a real issue. I could not cinch the bellows down enough to prevent this. I took a Weapons Retension course one night and one of the drills was to have others try and take your pistol (unloaded and safety checked, of course) from your holster. Because the bellows is held down by velcro straps a quick yank rearward would release the straps and loosen the pistol enough that anyone could easily pull out the pistol. Not good in any situation. I think it might have been different if I was running the pistol with a light but I wanted the option to go with or without the light on the pistol. I'm rethinking this strategy and am considering a drop leg dedicated to the make and model of my pistol.","label":0}

{"text":"A warning to all, size down at least 1 size, OK, 2 sizes. The flattening panel in the front needs to fit you like a girdle and when it doesn't, there are pooches on both sides of it, and you, at the tummy. Washing and drying on a hot setting doesn't do much, NYDJ recommends cold water. Washing in hot just relaxes the spandex and the shrinkage is just temporary from the cotton shrinking. I was also disappointed that they were NOT Skinny. Slim, yes, but not what I expected. I couldn't return them because the return policy states that you can't open the package to try them on, and expect to return them. The one good thing is that NYDJ positions the back pockets closer together and this is more flattering on your rear. If the prices weren't so darn high, I would order the leggings, but not having a good experience the first time, I'll pass. Too bad, I was excited to look great in them.","label":0}

{"text":"My brother has been playing bass guitar for the past few years and every six months or so, I see him tossing another busted stand into the trash. I asked him why he was going through them so quickly and he told me its because he keeps buying the cheap plastic kind because he thinks that's all he needs. Well after going through three of them in the span of six months, I knew I had to intervene and provide a little guidance and assistance. I did my research and found this little guitar stand not only provides an amazing amount of durability but also the best bang for your buck. When I purchased this item, I wanted to see how strong it was. I had already visited the local music store to compare. They started at $30 and shot all the way up to $100. Now I know musicians love to display their instruments but a hundred bucks is where I draw the line. When I saw this priced at under $20, I knew that was a fair amount but it wasn't until I held it in my hands that I was convinced this was far superior to any of the others I had ever sampled. This stand is made from pure steel and not some composite aluminum material found in the department stores. It's very tough and has a good weight to it. I would feel very comfortable hanging a 10lbs+ instrument on it. I tried to bend it gently and quickly realized it would take a lot more strength than I could expend at that moment to even put a dent into it. It is extraordinarily durable and for such a low price, I was astonished. I couldn't believe my brother would spend so much money on inferior stands when a pure gem was sitting under his nose the entire time. Musicians stress the importance of keeping their instrument in a safe and secure place when not in use and I can see why. My brother would flip out if I put his bass on his bed let alone the floor. If it wasn't in his hands it had to be on the stand. Comparing this stand to the other ones available is almost a joke. For the price, it can't be beaten. You're not only buying a solid piece of steel but also investing in the longevity of your equipment, and not to mention, this thing looks absolutely gorgeous holding up my brother's bass. If you're thinking about buying a new instrument or just replacing your current stand, you need to purchase this product. With all of the money you've already invested into your guitar\/bass you'll definitely need a quality piece of equipment to keep it safe. This should be the first, last, and only stand you'll ever need... Unless of course you've got multiple instruments. I feel much safer with this stand holding up my brother's bass than with any of the other ones out there. And for less than $20, this is the best value and ultimate compliment for your instrument.","label":0}

{"text":"WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.","label":0}

{"text":"Agatha Christie's best known detectives are Poirot and Miss Marple but far from their only ones. The 1983-84 series, Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime followed the adventures of a lesser known detective pair Tommy and Tuppence (played by James Warwick and Francesca Annis). Before the series began, an adaptation of the first Tommy and Tuppence novel The Secret Adversary aired as a telefilm and told of the first adventure of Tommy and Tuppence when they met after World War I in need of work and began their careers with an ad in the newspapers and found themselves involved case of international intrigue. The plot was superb with a lot of tricks and an amazing number of red herrings. The cinematography was great for the 1980s with a far better quality than the typical British TV show of the era. The cinematography of the main series was more typical of the era which was a definite downgrade. The series finds a married Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency and assuming the pseudonym of the jailed original owner of the Agency, Mr. Blunt while Tuppence pretends to be his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson. The stories are set in the 1920s and the producers do a great job creating a period feel, even on a limited budget. Annis carries the show in that regard, looking very much the fashionable 1920s woman in looks as well as her general manner. The book upon which the series was based, was a bit of a tongue in cheek look at popular detective fiction and that feel comes through with several tips of the cap to the great detectives while maintaining a light feel to most stories. The pacing could be a bit slow with too much melodrama and lead to a resolution that was more than a little bit rushed. There were some great episodes in the series, but some stinkers as well. The best episodes in the series are arguably the last two, \"The Case of the Missing Lady\" (from a comedy standpoint) and \"The Cracker\" from adramatic standpoint with \"The House of Lurking Death\" probably the weakest. In the end, the series is worth watching because of the delightful performance of Annis and her chemistry with Warwick. While not a great show, like many other programs of bygone days, it will beat most of what's on television these days.","label":0}

{"text":"I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use. I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints\/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need. On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.","label":1}
{"text":"I purchased this burner and got the next day $3.99 shipping through prime so I could brew a batch quickly...not disappointed at all! The assembly was easy and quick. It is sturdy and man...does it kick out some heat. I didn't need to push it all the way for my purposes. I used about 1\/2 power and had 8 gallons of hose water boiling in 24 minutes! That was with a lid on. When it came time to boil my wort, it worked great. I didn't time it, but it was quickly up to boiling, and I had about 7.5 gallons going. It could easily handle more, I just don't have a pot big enough to test it. The great part is that there is room to grow with this burner. I have a 9 gallon pot that is pretty wide, and I have the adjustable base set to the narrowest setting. I could get a 15 to 20 gallon pot on top of this burner very safely. It is rock solid and can handle a lot of weight. The wind baffles work well, too. It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much. I can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell. This should be plenty for a couple of batches, so I am planning on spending about 10 dollars on propane per batch. I would highly recommend this burner...no complaints whatsoever.","label":0}

{"text":"I was a bit worried when I bought this since it had somewhat mixed reviews, but I bought it anyway since the reviews were more geared towards the positive side. The main complaints I saw were durability of the chrome plating. I can assure you I've used this controller almost every day for 4 months now and all the gold plating is there. The only bad thing is that small surface scratches do show up, but that is to be expected with this type of finish. You ever have a cell phone LCD screen show small scratches that are barely even noticeable? That's what happened to mine, but they are minimal. It didn't get too many fingerprints on it. To be perfectly honest, this held up better than my white controller that came with my console. My original white controller has worn thumbsticks (that are actually loose and have no grip) and the white controller built up a ton of dirt. This controller still looks almost as nice as when I took it out of the package. But then again maybe its because I kept better care of it since I love it so much :) Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. It is durable, the mod is awesome, and the service provided by Geniusmods has been great. 5 stars in my book!","label":1}
{"text":"This is a very handy Preparedness option if you want to fill your bathtub with safe, potable drinking water (in advance, while water pressure is still available). These are widely offered all over the Internet at prices from $18 up. These are essentially just giant vinyl bags with a nozzle\/cap closure. The same exact bag seems to be sold under various brand names, but it's the same product. I like this simple concept. Here are some points to consider: 1. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Once full (even partially full), this thing will weigh a ton. Completely full, 100 gallons weighs 800 pounds. It's not portable. You're not going to be lifting it out of the tub and carrying it anywhere. The vinyl would likely not survive 800 lbs of stress even if you had the manpower to lift it. 2. Once it's in place and full, your bathtub (and\/or shower) are out of action and can't be used for anything else...like bathing, or decontaminating anything. So this works best if you have multiple bathrooms\/tubs in order to spare one for water storage. 3. These are one-time-use items. Once you use it, and empty it, the vinyl bag is just too large to dry thoroughly after it's emptied. So there's that. On the other hand, 100 gallons of water (at 1 gallon per person per day) is a great resource. 4. If portability is a concern, you can achieve much the same thing using clean large plastic storage bins (Sterilite brand or similar) and stacking those in the tub. Same concept but capable of being moved if necessary. SUMMARY: If you have a bathtub you can afford to dedicate solely to water storage in an emergency, this is a fast, easy, simple and clever solution to hold 90 days+ of survival water for one person, 45+ days for 2 people, etc. It pays to comparison shop on price. It's large, and a challenge to dry to dry out hygienically for possible re-use (consider a blow dryer and a funnel?), so I consider this a 100-gallon 'disposable'. On the whole, at around $20, this is a great solution at a low price for 100 gallons. Just make sure you have a tub you are willing to dedicate solely to water storage. Hope this is helpful. Stay safe and happy trails, everybody. PS: I just read reviewer Jennifer Gonzales's comments that people often overlook that they already have a ready source of clean emergency water in their home water heater. That's very true, and good to remember. There are lots of good how-to videos on YouTube on this--you'll just need to know in advance which valves are involved, and most units will need a crescent wrench to open the faucet type drain at the base of the heater.","label":0}

ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter. To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND\/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business.

I used one and nothing happened, no ink, no nothing; and I thought \"they don't work!\" and then, I had an aha moment when I saw the instructions on the marker! The steps are so easy to follow that even my 3 year old daughter was helping me with the first two. So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink. I like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don't squeak. The markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected! The color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don't have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror. She couldn't believe me when I told her to do that (because that doesn't happen around here), she ran as fast as she could before I change my mind! I can use them on my Pyrex to make sure someone won't take it by mistake at gatherings, or for my \"to do list\" just in case I loose the paper version, or my daughter might think daddy's car needs some color! So many things..... The only color I wish they have is purple, my daughter's favorite color! We ended up using red and blue and voila, purple! But over all, I LOVE them! I should say to use caution when replacing the cap as it can catch on the marker top and mash it. My daughter did that to a couple of them.","label":0}

The instructions state \"Place the pack in microwave and set timer for a max of 40 seconds\" along with some other basic guidelines. I read and followed the instructions. At about 15 seconds, there was a popping sound. I immediately stopped the microwave and checked on the pack. It was melted and bubbling on the surface. With pressure, gel now leaks from it. This pack is NOT capable of being heated in a microwave. I didn't get the chance to try freezing it, so I don't know how well that works.

The taste wasn't as chocolatey as some of the other cereals on the market, but I would happily trade the lack of flavor for the lack of reduced processed sugars, etc. I just wish it had tasted a little better so the kids would have eaten it. If you are buying it for you, as an adult, and don't need the sweet flavor to make you happy, then this is a good brand.

{"text":"In 2011, the journal of gastroenterology found that green coffee bean increased average weight loss by 5.5 pounds in THREE different studies. This was on an extremely low dose of only 200MG a day. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have bought a supplement like this, but the evidence is hard to ignore. Naturabest's bottle recommends a dose of 800mg, which is considered the appropriate amount for this supplement. I personally started taking this supplement 3 weeks ago, taking ONE dose per day, on my way home from work, before dinner. I really started noticing a reduction in appetite after about one week taking the supplement religiously, so it may take that much time or longer for you. Since I started taking green coffee bean extract, I have lost 6.5Lbs total. I have toyed with the idea of taking two doses per day, but I'm in no huge rush to lose weight (I have been overweight my entire life), and don't want to overdo it. I AM losing weight, and I WILL keep it off, and this supplement is helping me accomplish that in an easier way than I would have ever thought possible before. This brand seems on par in price with other brands, I picked this one because it was the first one that showed up when I searched on amazon and it wasn't dishonestly priced (sometimes I worry about products that seem a little too cheap). I will continue buying this product until I have reached my goal weight (22.5 more pounds to go), and then I will take this as-needed once I am there.","label":1}

{"text":"I replaced a Corsair 500R with this case and I'm glad I did. I originally replaced the 500R because it just felt cheaply made and it wasn't that great to build in. The 550D has a very solid build quality and I haven't had a single issue with it since I bought it around 6 months or so ago. I love the magnetic dust filters on the side and top of the case and they do a very good job catching most of the dust and keeping the inside of your case relatively dust free. The bottom dust filter is good but mine has started to bend a little causing it to be slightly warped at the back of the case. Although the dust filters work great they are stating to get hard to clean. No matter if I spray them with air or wash them in the sink they still look dusty all the time. It doesn't effect them working but it does make your computer look dirty all the time. The cable management is pretty good on this case but I would have like more places to tie cables down on the top behind the motherboard tray. I also would've liked if the motherboard tray was raised slightly more in order to run cables behind the motherboard better. I was only able to run 4 cables behind the motherboard before there just wasn't anymore space and I couldn't screw the motherboard down. I would fully recommend getting a fully modular power supply to make building in the 550D easier. You may have issues getting the back door to fully close with all the extra connectors you're not using. I know all Corsair cases are made for the H100 cooler but I had a hell of a time installing the H100 in this case. The problem I had was there was barely enough space at the top between the motherboard and the radiator to clear my motherboard power connector. So right now the fans on the H100 are sitting right on top of my power connector pushing it down slightly. Other people may not have the same issue depending on where the connector sits on their motherboard. If you have one on the top of your motherboard be warned that it will be a tight fit. Lastly the main reason why people will buy this case, the sound dampening foam. In my experience, it doesn't do much of anything to quiet your computer down. I've tried with the side and top panels off and on and I noticed no difference in sound but obviously a lot higher temperatures with the panels on. The main reason I think it doesn't work is the foam is way too thin in order to stop enough sound to notice a difference. I feel as though they should just remove the foam all together from the 550D and sell it for a little cheaper. Overall the 550D is a very nice case once you look past the few annoyances it has. I've owned several cases before buying this one and so far this has been the best case I owned. I think for its price point Corsair makes some of the best looking and best made cases around. There's little doubt in my mind I'd ever consider buying another brand of case in the future unless other companies really step their game up as far as build quality.","label":0}
{"text":"I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree. They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with! The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve. The 6-year-old is a tall 49\" but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride. The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1\/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else. There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included. The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though! After about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising. It's very sturdy and well made. I definitely recommend this Jeep to anyone with kids. They will love it!","label":0}

Make sure you wipe off any excess after the conditioner has completely soaked in, even if you can't see it, otherwise the surface will feel very sticky. Looks like honey and feels like honey, especially if you don't wipe down after soaking in. Leather Honey lasts much longer than any other product I have used, 4-6 months with normal use. The only drawback is the leather will darken quite a bit. Not a problem on black leather but your light browns will turn to dark brown after you apply. If you want to preserve the color I recommend Bick 4. Doesn't last as long or hydrate the leather as well as Leather Honey but it will not darken the leather but a very very small amount. Bick 4 on my light colored leather and Lucchese ostrich boots, Leather Honey on everything else. Also, go for the 16 oz bottle of Leather Honey, you will use it.","label":0}

I have tried everything out there. Sprays, vinegar, you name it, I have tried it (my cat is a repeat offender). So when I watched \"My Cat From Hell\", and Jackson recommended this, I thought \"what do I have to lose\". If I could give this 10 stars, I would! I didn't honestly believe this would eliminate it, as I have tried every so-called eliminator, and nothing has worked. I used it on 3 spots, 2 of which were minor and one that was bad. My cat got a urinary infection, so she peed on the floor. The urine was a stronger smell than usual because of her infection. The 2 spots were probably only 1 time offenses, but the stronger spot was most likely several repeat urinations in that same area. I tried 2 different products on all spots, and the smell still lingered. The bad spot was still very strong. I then tried this exactly as the directions say, and the 2 minor spots are gone, completely gone. The bad spot took several treatments. I have a , so I saturated the area with the cleaner in the spray bottle and let is set for about 30 minutes. I then sucked the cleaner up with my Bissell, and repeated the process. The smell was gone in the entire strip of carpet, except for a lingering of it in one small area. You have to get down into the carpet with your nose to smell the lingering scent. I believe that with continued treatment, I can eliminate the entire odor completely. I will be buying a bulk pack of these things from now on. I'm so excited I might wet myself!

{"text":"\"Gone Girl\" is a David Fincher thriller, and that will tell you something about the film. This is a story about the \"missing Amy,\" which is dark, twisted and unpredictable. I am not saying this is one of the greatest mysteries ever filmed. It simply is not, because the script is, if scrutinized closely, full of illogical things. Still, it is darkly entertaining enough to forget these plot holes, thanks to the slick direction and fine acting. The story starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. The police investigation starts, followed by heavy press coverage. The Nick slowly realizes that despite their five-year marriage, he knew so little about his wife. Not only that; people start to think that Nick is not what he seems. So what really happened? \"Gone Girl\" takes time in unfolding its complicated story, and maybe too much time. (It runs about 150 minutes.) But don't ever expect something like \"Zodiac,\" or a mystery based on realism. What happens in the last 30 minutes of \"Gone Girl\" is so incredible. I'm giving four stars because of some of the effective performances from the cast, including Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister Margo. Perhaps her likeable character is the most convincing part of the film.","label":0}

{"text":"My house has numerous light fixtures that require what are identified as G16.5 light bulbs. A number of these lights are on 6 or more hours per day and, until recently, I used incandescent bulbs. To save on electricity, I tried CFL bulbs, but they provided an uneven light and the spiral bulbs were visible through the light-fixture glass. I happened upon the GE Lighting model 68169 LED bulbs at a local store, and, functionally, they have been an ideal replacement. They provide just the right amount of light, consume only 4.5 watts, and have the warm yellowish light that I prefer. Plus, they appear solidly built and I suspect will last a long time. When I purchased these bulbs, the price charged by Amazon was $17.78, but the price at my local department store was $10.00. Hopefully Amazon will reconsider their price, as I would like to buy more of these. As an aside, many of the following reviews are of different light bulbs, so anyone reading these reviews should keep that in mind. The bulbs I purchased are \"GE Lighting 68169 Energy smart LED 4.5-Watt (25-watt replacement) 270-Lumen G16.5 Light Bulb with Candelabra Base.\"","label":0}

{"text":"I'm an idiot, a moron, am hopeless. When it comes to picking out \"GIRLIE STUFF\"... Just ask my loving bride of over 35 years. So when I saw this and I loved it, I KNEW it must be just awful. I had to try. She has spent 6 straight months nursing me after a LOT of \"stuff\" from surgical complications etc. She gave up 3 weeks of her vacation and a lot more to care for me tirelessly. I saw this and HAD to at least try. It was so affordable I knew it was something I could afford to lose money on if another failure.  To my amazement she LOVES this, and her love for it is genuine. When an old dingbat ..... oh wait....when my beloved little bride gets that \"look\" on her face, you know, the kind when she is going to cry and you PANIC but then pause since you soon realize it is going to be \"happy tears\"? Well that is what I got. I was tempted to tell her I loved her so much that all these precious diamonds were NOTHING compared to my love of her. But I figured I would get just about half of that out of my mouth before a plate would be flying across the room with my name on it:-)  So in reality, while I wish with all my heart that I COULD give her real diamonds and precious stones. I Wish I could give her everything in this world AND the next, whatever that may be. But I CAN give here this and tell her I love her and hope to be a better and more well hubby and that will have to do for now. In the meantime this earns a full 5 stars.

The very bottom has a net in case one needs to put something wet or that needs to air in the organizer. It holds fairly large bottles and tubes. There's one compartment that is long, and it is good for brushes and pencils. The next row has 3 divided pockets and the top row has multiple small pockets. It has belts around it, so that when you roll it up, you can belt it, which makes it very easy to put in a gym bag or suitcase. Really the only thing about it that I do not care for is the big WODISON logo across the top, but that's a minor thing. Images pending.","label":0}

{"text":"The author of \"Hell\" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book. In \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.","label":1}

{"text":"These is a really good head unit. However, it does have some drawbacks. First, anytime you hook up your phone (i have an iPhone) and you want to play the iPod, the unit will always start playing the first song in the alphabet. Even if you turn your car off take the phone and come back to the car to start playing where you left off, it will again start at the first song in the alphabet. That part annoys me. Next the microphone for the bluetooth is not that great. People have a hard time hearing me, and I like to do voice to text when I am driving. With the bluetooth, it has no idea what I am saying, and therefore, has kinda made that feature useless. The last issue I have, which may not be a big issue to some, is that when you turn the unit off, the LCD screen stays on. It will say that it is off, but it is still lit up with the animation still going. I also think that the apps that are useable by this head unit are too limited. I only use one of the apps that it is compatible for. They need to do some upgrading on that.","label":0}

The instructions do seem complicated but if you take the time to look at the pictographs you'll be fine. Basically adhere the protector to your device, grab the protruding end on the right, slowly pull away towards the right, remove air bubbles with the cheap cardboard \"tool\" they give you (or a credit card), peel off the secondary layer and remove any excess bubbles. If you take the time to make sure everything's dust free you won't regret this purchase. And since you only get one shot I wouldn't rush it, not for $9 bucks a pop.","label":1}

{"text":"Together with \"The Seth Material\", \"Seth speaks\" is the most well-known book featuring Seth starring himself. Apparently, this book pretty much started the New Age channelling craze. Seth is a multi-dimensional, spiritual personality from another plane of existence, who periodically speaks through the mouth of medium Jane Roberts (whom he calls Ruburt). Now, that sentence should really be in the past tense, since Roberts is deceased, but Seth claims that time doesn't really exist, so I might as well speak in the present tense, wouldn't you agree? I tend to avoid channelled material, but the few items I somehow managed to sift through were quite different from \"Seth speaks\". This book blends incredibly dense, pseudo-philosophical and boring prose with a strange and much welcome sense of humour. In general, the channelled spirits seem to take themselves far too seriously! Seth makes slips of the tongue (at one point forgetting the number of chapters he has dictated), has a love-hate relationship with cats, claims to have lost his dog somewhere on our planet, and seems fond of beer! He also insists on starting every other sentence with the words \"Now\". At one point he jokingly refers to himself as a ghostwriter... As for Seth's message, it's another version of New Age thinking - I sometimes wonder how many versions there might be out there? God isn't a person, but an ever-evolving Consciousness, referred to by Seth as All That Is. Time as we know it doesn't exist. An almost infinite number of alternate realities co-exist simultaneously. (In some parallel universe, Seth's dog presumably wasn't taken by the dog-catcher.) Strictly speaking, reincarnation therefore doesn't exist either, since all our \"previous lives\" exist at the same time. We are all multi-dimensional personalities, living on many different planes of existence, constantly evolving in innumerable directions. We are also somehow part of God, who is the ultimate multi-dimensional entity. Weirdly for a system that lacks time, All That Is nevertheless evolves and constantly creates new forms. This is, of course, impossible for us puny mortals to comprehend. Everything that happens to us is created by ourselves. Our consciousness creates our reality, whether good, bad or ugly. Our material world with all its suffering is a mass hallucination. We should all learn and evolve. Since everything is an illusion suspended in a timeless Now (pun intended), it's difficult to see the point of the exercise. How can you learn and evolve within an illusion where everything exists simultaneously? At various points in \"Seth speaks\", our friend tends to mellow his message somewhat. I have already pointed out that All That Is apparently evolves despite there not being any time, and it would seem that our existence in some sense isn't completely illusory, after all. As for suffering and evil, Seth concedes that suffering doesn't necessarily have to exist, that we suffer due to our unevolved state, and that the point of suffering is to teach us to overcome suffering - a somewhat softer view than that taken by, say, Dolores Cannon (see my previous review on this plane of existence). Still, when it comes to the philosophical points about time, space, matter and consciousness, I would say that a few books by David Ray Griffin might do Seth some good... Seth also says a few scandalous things about Jesus. Is anyone surprised? Apparently, Jesus was part of a broader personality incarnating as three distinct human beings: John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul. In 2075, Paul will return. This is tantamount to the Second Coming. Seth is unsure about the crucifixion. At one point, he seems to be suggesting that the entire Gospel stories are dramas and dreams, \"real\" on a psychic level but not in any material-historical sense. At another point, he spins a scenario similar to the Muslim one, only more weird. (Of course, the Muslim traditionsabout Jesus are in themselves warped versions of the Gnostic \"laughing saviour\".) Apparently, Jesus got away. Judas deliberately \"betrayed\" the wrong man to the authorities, a poor deluded crackpot who thought he was the Christ and absolutely wanted to be crucified. In drugged condition, this substitute was indeed executed by the Romans. His body was stolen by some of the disciples in the dead of night (hence the empty tomb). The real Jesus then appeared to the disciples, who therefore believed he had been resurrected. In reality, he was still alive and well in his physical body. Ah, what evangelical heresy-hunters could do with this! Does Seth really exist? At one point, our ghostwriter comes close to conceding that he doesn't: \"This voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage\". A similarity to other channelled material is the amount of historical references which makes no sense. Seth believes in Atlantis. He expounds at length on an underground civilization called Lumania, whose inhabitants were so fearful and shy that they made up the fierce warrior god Jehovah as a protector. Seth claims to have been a certain 4th century pope, but no such pope is recorded by history. More damningly, Seth claims that a Muslim Arab he once met wavered between faith in Allah and faith in Moses - an absurd proposition. Presumably, Seth or Ruburt have mixed up Allah with Muhammad! But even that is absurd, since Muslims recognize Moses as a prophet. Somebody should send Seth a book by Huston Smith on comparative religion, c\/o Lumania. Part of my own multi-dimensional personage wants to believe that Seth is a real being and even help him find that poor dog of his (probably a Newfie). The other part feels that Seth is simply a part of Jane Roberts' earthly personality. He doesn't say anything that's *really* out of the ordinary compared to what every other Theosophist, kabbalist or esotericist has already said - except those parts that can be checked and disproved. But then, I suppose followers of Seth could claim that their beloved entity really did get some things completely wrong. In contrast to many other purported spirit guides, Seth is strangely unassuming. Despite the humour, I can't say \"Seth speaks\" is an easy read. It's repetitive, long-winding and often really boring. But yes, it could be of some interest to scholars of comparative religion or new agey seekers. One sure wonders how the contemporary spiritual scene would have looked like, had more entities like Seth been channelled by the Neo-Theosophical faithful? Imagine a conversation between Seth and Osho! Now, I'm not sure how to rate \"Seth speaks\", but finally I decided to play it nice and give our dog-loving, beer-sipping and vaguely Islamophobic ghostwriter three and a half stars.","label":0}

{"text":"I'd like to say I really liked these 'jumbo' dinosaurs. But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.","label":1}

{"text":"I read lots of reviews before I purchased. I also heard about it on Dr Oz. I read all \"star\"reviews, but decided to try it for myself. It was a good price. I took it for about 2 weeks. Some reviews suggested taking it with food and water, so I did. I can't give a fair comment on weight loss effects because I feel I wasn't on it long enough. Though I didn't lose a pound, I moderately exercise everyday. Don't feel it really suppressed my appetite either. I gave product 3 stars because it may work for someone else. If you are sensitive to caffeine, then I suggest you don't try it.","label":1}
{"text":"Title says it all... You can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. They have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners. They performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. In fact for half the money, you can get a set of Sennheisers that out perform these hands down. In my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. Guess it boils down to: Are you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. They get points for style, and bass performance is solid. Mids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. They simply fall flat for most music. Are you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? These are your headphones. They do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. They have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... At $200, they are just over priced bling. To each their own, I think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. Or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. You can do much much better in a set of Grados or Sennheisers. If you just want ridiculous bass you can get the Klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. I can't tell ya what you like, but I know good sound... And you may have noticed I didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that I seen others mention. Basically for all the same reasons... You can do a lot better for a lot less money. But even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of Grados or Sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent. That's my opinion : )","label":1}

{"text":"Seriously. This has made me so angry to own this piece of crap mouse. I got it because I have smaller hands right? Cool a gaming mouse for smaller hands! PERFECT. Until I used it. The Mouse JIGGLES AND JITTERS. It's like it's having an outright seizure on my screen! I tried installing drivers, getting the OFFICIAL RAZER MOUSE PAD and NOPE. My mouse cursor likes to dance and flail itself upwards along my screen. Now it'd be fine I -guess- if it was just while it was idling. Sure. But it did it while I was WORKING. I use this mouse not just for gaming and precision, but for Graphic Design, which is like Gaming in that I need precision, so when I'm healing, or when I'm adjusting the size of something in Photoshop the last thing I want is a wonky sudden twitch. I swear to god it's like this Mouse has Tourette's Syndrome. Because EVERY so often it feels the need to jolt and jitter and simultaneously make me groan in agony. Well whatever. Not the worst 30$ I ever spent my money on. I'll just use it, it's decent after any other issues. Except this thing has a huge issue. Sometimes it doesn't feel like being a mouse! Sometimes it feels like being a paperweight But it's schizophrenic tourette's mouse so it can't decide from one moment to the next! So as it's making up it's mind I hear the constant BABMP. BABMP BABMP. Sound from my computer saying YOU HAVE A DEVICE NO YOU DONT YOU HAVE A NO YOU DONT. And so I tried to get support from Razer. The company that MAKES the bloody thing, their response. \"Seems like it's broken\" Okay. It's broken now what. \"Well you can ship it to us with all the product info and we will send you a replacement.\" Okay cool. So who do you guys use to ship? \"Anyone you want.\" Oh okay so I just give you a receipt and you credit me back? \"No you pay for shipping\" ... Okay but you guys get shipping on the way back right? \"No you pay shipping both ways.\" So on TOP of buying a JUNK Mouse. I have to pay for the shipping THERE. And the shipping BACK?! Yeah. Razer has lost a customer for life. Screw these guys.","label":0}

These are really cute shoes and could be very comfortable, but not for me. These shoes are designed for people who need wide shoes for a reason other than bone structure. The toe box fit my feet well, but there was so much room for the rest of my foot, that my foot rubbed and I ended up with four blisters. I was very disappointed. But it helped me understand why when I entered a Clarks store one time and asked for wide shoes, the clerk asked me, \"Why do you think you need wide shoes?\" I'm guessing that that is how they make their wide shoes- wide overall. If you are a large person though, you will be thrilled! Great cushion in the sole, cute style, cool for summer!","label":0}
{"text":"Here's the reason why I'm giving it five stars even though it didn't fit - it came in quickly, and I should've read more of the reviews to understand how the sizing would work, considering it's still a great product. I'm 130lbs and 5'9, so I am very slim, but even a medium was too small. For any of you that are my size but already have a booty to begin with, I'd recommend getting an xtra large. It looks like you have butt pads on when you get it too small! So just be extra careful. It gave my butt a great lift, however, if I were to try to wear the medium even though it was too small, I'd have to readjust it every second","label":0}

{"text":"There was a time, not too long ago, when Gold Toe made the best socks that money could buy. They were twice or even three times as expensive as the competition, but considering that a pair could be washed and used thirty times or more before wearing out, they were still the best deal in town. Buying 12 pairs at a time, all looking the same of course, would set me for a year. Then a few years ago I noticed something had happened. Gold Toe had become strangely affordable, only somewhat more expensive than the generic brands. The next thing I noticed was after a couple of washes, some of them had shrunk, others had holes in them, and within short just about all of them had worn out. Being a long time Gold Toe fan, i hoped it was just a bad batch, so gave them one more chance. Same thing. I am guessing Gold Toe has, like so many other companies, fired their workers and are simply slapping their label on production runs from the same sweat shops that make the regular generic wear and dispose clothing. I no longer buy Gold Toe as I see little reason to pay extra without getting anything extra. If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears.","label":0}

I was a little worried that the espresso color would be too dark, but it's quite lovely and has some vague red tones, almost like a mahogany - even came with a touch-up pen. I could not be more pleased, especially for only $155! I highly recommend this product.","label":0}

{"text":"Dimension: 51\"Wx18.5\"Dx15.5\"H I rather like the style and colors used in the off-white version of this ottoman but the main issue that I have with it is that it is really rather short. at only 15.5\" high it's oddly short, granted it does work for putting shoes on and such at the foot of the bed but it really should be a good 4-5 inches taller. Then it would be a much nicer ottoman. -The covering fabric seems to be of nice quality and should withstand abuse. -Padding on top of the ottoman is adequate but that may be an issue over time, it works okay now but I'm not sure that it will last a long time. I'll have to be sure to rotate where I sit on it when I get home or am getting ready in the morning to make sure it lasts. -The legs are mounted with 2 screws to make sure they don't come loose and can't rotate, nicely done there. -Interior floor, it's okay, don't think you are going to put very heavy items inside, it will not likely support them. It's good for lighter items like sheets, blankets and maybe some smaller pillows, possibly a couple moderately weighted items but don't go crazy. -Lid support arms are of good quality and shouldn't catch too much on stored items but don't put things in their path as it will cause closing issues. When I first got this out of the shipping box I thought it was going be a 5 star item but after placing it in the location and trying it out I noticed that the height is a big issue for me. Granted I can put some blocks under it to raise it up but it would have been really nice to have the extra height in the storage area of the ottoman so that I could fit a whole bunch more items in there. Still good though, just could be a lot better.","label":0}

When you buy a Rick Steves' guide, you know you're going to get well refined content that has been organized and prioritized to allow for an authentic travel experience. Some places will be included and some won't. Rick does not intend to make his books encyclopedic or entirely comprehensive in their coverage, but his choice of locations (or, rather, his exclusion of locations) in this book can leave a traveler scratching his head. Almost the entire western part of the country, and particularly locations on Lake Geneva, are ignored. Basel and Geneva are completely absent. The French-speaking part of the country is very poorly represented. His selection of Alpine villages is also a bit odd, choosing to include Murten and Zermatt which, though lovely, are so small that they can only accommodate a very small number of tourists at any given time. Authentic? Certainly. Practical? Feasible? Questionable. And Rick falling for the touristy glitz of mountain resorts like St. Moritz seems very, well, un-Steves-like! His chapter on scenic rail journeys is good, and certainly represents are high quality attraction that should not be missed. You certainly get Rick's signature selectivity in this guide, but if his tastes aren't compatible with yours you may find this guide lacking in coverage.","label":0}

{"text":"We've been using the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub 1 TB Media Center for 9 months or so and when it works, it provides a very nice entertainment experience. The image and sound quality are great, the system plays back almost any file format that you feed it, and, when it can find\/stay connected, playback of media from other devices on our network works well. We keep our media on a NAS and so the Hub's NAS support was a major determining factor for us, but the support is not very strong. The Media Library feature would be fantastic, if it worked. This feature grabs and displays metadata for your media, like screencaps, reviews and cast details from videos, in a browseable interface. It also (supposedly) tracks recently added media and recently viewed\/listened media, to help you more easily access things that are in your heavy rotation. The few times that system has been able to scan our media (less than 100 GB of movies, approximately 500 GB of music), we've really liked this feature. The initial library scan takes hours and even if we set the system to not rescan on reboot, it does anyway. We thought maybe we were asking too much for the Library to work with our NAS (although, were disappointed that that might ebe the case), so we copied our media to the Hub's drive. But even playback of local media is sketchy -- on start-up, the system can take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes before it can find media on _its own drive_. And anytime you switch sources, say from the Hub's hard drive to a network share, the scanning has to be done again for the Library to function. If you don't care about any of the advanced features, or the number of clicks and pauses it may take to play back a song or video, the Hub _does_ work as a basic media playback device. But that's not how Western Digital advertises (or charges for) it. We've give the Hub a fair shot -- we're relatively technically adept in my household and we've read manuals and forums and have tried a variety of settings to no avail. We even tested it beyond the Amazon return window, hoping a charmed combo of settings or a firmware upgrade might fix these issues, but the upgrades seem to center on the addition of new services, like Spotify or MLB.com and we've noticed no improvement in the issues that plague us. That sort of expansion is welcome, but we'd rather the focus was on making the device's basics solid. We're stuck with the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub, but we don't recommend it.","label":0}

{"text":"1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman. Polly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man. Did you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour. Another is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea... Thad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. \"You silly dupe!\" I heard you say. One more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the \"My mom's the President\" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative. The timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: \"So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?\" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending.","label":0}

{"text":"The Infant Optics baby monitor is simply the best one that we have used yet. We replaced our original $200 Summer color video monitor with the Infant Optics monitor, after briefly trying out the $150 Motorola monitor, and there are several key improvements we noticed over the others we've tried: 1. The image clarity is excellent using the standard lens, in both day and night mode. 2. The sound quality when talking to your child is impressive - it sounds very realistic, even when singing lullabies to our toddler! 3. The screen is large, and the interface is easy to use. I enjoy the kick-stand as well. 4. The temperature monitor is very helpful to have, and seems accurate. My only bones to pick with the product are: 1. If you lay the monitor down without the kickstand, the sound is reduced because the speaker is covered. 2. I wish that Infant Optics also manufactured a silicon case for the monitor - I firmly believe in having a case for all my electronic devices, no matter how well made. I love this product, and recommend it to anyone looking for a great baby monitor with 2-way voice, day\/night picture mode, a thermometer, and a great lens. It is a cut above any monitor we have tried previously.","label":0}
{"text":"I bought this based on the \"works great for my kayak\" reviews. Well, the lip of their kayak must be totally different from mine, although it seemed that mine is pretty well the same as other recreational kayaks. The mount can only be attached vertically, with the screws going up and down, and there's not enough room on the outer curve of the lip to do that. Darn, I really though I had something useful.

{"text":"My husband loves home-made pies, so I thought it would be fun to make mini-pies from time to time, just to change things up a little. After reading the Amazon reviews for various competing mini-pie makers, I ordered this well-reviewed SUNBEAM 4-PIECE PIE MAKER. Little did I know what it had in store for me! I followed the booklet's recipe for blueberry mini-pies to the letter. I lightly oiled the pie cups, preheated the pie maker, used the provided tool to cut top and bottom crusts from Pillsbury ready-made crusts, prepared the filling, used the provided tool to press the bottom crusts into the pie maker, measured 1\/2 cup of filling into each bottom crust, added the top crusts, and clamped the top of the pie maker shut. The pie maker began emitting steam, which seemed odd. After 10 minutes, the pie crusts were done. However, the pie filling had boiled out onto the pie-maker plates, and a lot of it had spilled down the outside and into the hinges. Because the pie-maker plates were hot, the filling was busily burning onto the plates. As I was removing the mini-pies, the bottom of one burst and dropped all its filling. The final straw was my husband's comment that his intact mini-pie seemed \"kind of filled with air\"! Oh well. Maybe I should have used one of the booklet's two recipes for pie crusts--although the booklet did say you could use ready-made crusts from the grocery store. Or maybe I should have crimped the top and bottom crusts together--although the instructions did not say to do this, and the plates look like they will do the crimping when you close the lid. The cleanup was such a nightmare, I have no desire to ever use this appliance again. The mini-pies are cute, but the preparation time is about the same as for a full-sized, double-crust blueberry pie (except that a 9\" pie needs 45 minutes to bake). Also, the mini-pies don't hold much filling, especially if you have to use less than 1\/2 cup of filling. I rate this Sunbeam 4-piece pie maker at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","label":0}

The problem is it took several attempts to get the paper to feed and align properly. The final cards look nice, but the slight roughness on the edges still reveals that these are self printed cards. With professionally printed cards being very inexpensive (even from Avery), the only reason to use these would be if you need a small batch, frequently change the information, or want a way to print cards in an emergency.","label":0}

{"text":"As first time campers, and generally indoor people, my husband and I selected this tent to take on his son's first Boy Scout Camping Trip. We got the tent quickly, and when it came time to set it up at the campsite, we were able to do it easily. I watched a few of the videos on You Tube so I'd have some idea of how to do it, but the directions were easy to follow on the inside of the tent case. When we got ready to pack up and head out, in a bit of a rush, breaking down the tent and getting it back into the case was super simple - the case itself is a little bit large so that you can get it back in without having to fold it map-like to be exactly the same as it came out. Most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down. We had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind, so I can't vouch for leaking issues, but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that. I was VERY pleased with this tent.","label":0}

So, one thing that you do (and we currently do) is to make this a small supplement to fresh steamed asparagus or broccoli. That way, the sodium content will not be as much of a deterrent. When added to your family's meals with caution, this product can be a nice treat.","label":0}

Will's book addresses the complexity of strength training while providing straightforward approaches to take under specific circumstances. Those approaches are applied to new physiological concepts and training practices, which provide readers with the most current information in Strong Willed Designed For a Physical Purpose.

{"text":"Lollipop Chainsaw does not distinguish itself from other mediocre games. A teenager Juliet does her usual stint as a Zombie killer,which hardly perpetuates into an engrossing and gripping game play. Most of your time is spent running in a straight line,with an occasional fork on the side,to battle hordes of Zombies,a la Dynasty Warrior fashion. The problem with this mechanic is that the game play becomes placid and prosaic just minutes into the game.Both the Enemy placement and AI is atrocious.These surfeit of enemies just wait to be dispatched via quick button mashing,and do not provide any feasible challenge. You can purchase moves and health with Coins collected from killing enemies.These moves hardly come handy,because most of your time is spent quickly getting rid of your opponents,by mashing the attack button.Adding to the misery is that after you press an attack button,you have to wait for the subsequent animation to finish.You cannot break animation by successively pressing attack buttons to change animation in the vein of BAYONETTA. Also Juliet faces the other way around if the enemies shift their positions.As a result your character cannot turn quickly to retaliate. The Level design is also underwhelming where you are mostly running in a straight path through under detailed and unimpressive environs. There is an occasional fork or a boxy environment on the side,which is not particularly exciting to enter,because you will be doing the same thing.That is mashing the attack button to get rid of another group of stupid enemies.This is what you will be doing in the whole game.Later on you get the ability to use your weapon as a gun to shoot enemies,instead of hacking and slashing.These shooting excursions are also generic and totally lackluster.It feels the same as hacking.This minor advantage in shooting is that you can empty the bigger heath bar of a slightly stronger enemy,from a distance.The amount of strategy in firing,added to analready paper thin fighting mechanic,is negligible.There are also some mini games,interspersed between levels to break a modicum of boredom.Retro mini games between levels are annoying instead of entertaining.Developers should focus more on making their games tighter,challenging and more fulfilling.These gimmicky intrusions,just don't cut it. The graphics in cut scenes are okay,but the in game graphics are terrible.You will not be ably to see clearly the faces of the foes you fight against,90% of the time.levels are lacking and are devoid of any grandeur or magnificent architecture.Think of Tomb Raider II's superior level design. The only positive accolade that i can shower on this game,is its rich pulsating soundtrack .Akira Yamaoka shines once again. I will not talk much about the story,because there is nothing to talk about.This is one more D level storytelling with obtuse and offensive dialogues,that are sometimes gross and misplaced.None of the characters have any weight or personality. Lollipop Chainsaw is a below average game and an inherently mediocre one in whatever it tries to accomplish.With no credible staying power,this piece of software is reduced to a bargain bin status.","label":0}

You guys also can't deny that the controls were a bit glitchy, and the interaction scene areas are not expansive. I read a lot of the reviews, but I guess that I didn't see the ones that warn that this game has a short play time. Don't get me wrong, I loved the interactions, the graphics and the story line. But I would have loved this game more had it been longer and had some side games. Fun - just a heads up on the play time. (which was around 2 hours)","label":0}
{"text":"Haven is a paranormal, mystery and thriller type television series that airs on SyFy. This was a great follow up to the first season! In Short: Haven is home to the \"troubled.\" Some residents cause weird things to happen. Most don't even know what they are capable of. Audrey Parker,a now local police officer, is somehow immune. She is on a crusade to help Haven citizens, troubled or not, and find out who she is. The town is full of great and crazy folks. Nathan, another law enforcement official and son of the Chief, partners with Parker and a little something heats up between them. And Duke, always and forever into something shady, gives a hand when he isn't learning about his dead father. This is a great, adult, sci-fi series. The roles are well developed and very, very like-able. Officials solve various crimes in each episode, with each crime and ability different than the last. It keeps it interesting. Haven is not weighed down with heavy romance, which I love!","label":0}

Neither my wife nor I knew these sleepsacks existed but I found it on Amazon and decided to purchase one ... SURPRISE!!! After 3 weeks of continuous using it (with occasional washing of course) I realized this was the best solution for the night and immediately ordered 3 more of different colors and sizes. Only important detail: try getting synthetic fabrics instead of cotton if you are using a drier after washing them since they do shrink. Also the model that does not hold the baby's arms is a much better option, our baby didn't adjust well to the swaddling and he is comfortable moving his arms at night","label":0}

{"text":"I transport a lot of electronic equipment for my work, often cross-country. Courtesy of careless baggage handlers and drivers, I have watched my precious equipment thrown to ground from baggage holds, tossed into trunks and simply dropped \u2013 once into a pool of Philadelphia slush. No harm came to my equipment, though I can't say the same of my heart which stopped beating during these incidents. I have come to appreciate hard cases.  Xsories is a new entry into a market dominated by Pelican. Pelican is a premium brand and you pay for its stature. But you get an excellent case.  Xsories offers three cases, all of which are worthy competitors to Pelican and have lower prices for equivalent sizes.  The XSories Big Black Box 2.0 Shockproof Waterproof Storage Case feels as sturdy as a Pelican case. Made of \" ultra high-impact ABS plastic\", it doesn't flex much when pressed. At some point, I will figure out a kind of torture test like dropping it with an unused camera inside on to a concrete floor. But visually and to the touch, the case feels strong. The latches are positive and there is a hasp for a lock. The case may also be fitted with a strap which is a definite advantage over any of my Pelican cases. There is also a grip handle.  The inside of the Big Black Box is not particularly commodious, measuring about 10 x 7 x 3 inside.  The interior is fitted with a foam insert that has been pre-cut into small cubes. You just pluck out the cubes to create a space shaped to fit your components. This means putting some effort into designing your inside to get maximum utility from the space. There is a foam layer on the bottom of the case and inside the lid. Your equipment inside is going to be well protected from shock.  This is an all-climate case with an operating range of -40f through +176f. The case is described as \"water-proof\", though I am not sure just what the limits of that claim are. I do know t7hat heavy rain and winter slush will probably not penetrate. There is also an air pressure compensation valve, though I have never knowingly used this feature on a case.  Overall, Xsories has created a very worthy and less expensive competitor to Pelican and other \"premium\" brands, though you might want to consider the next step up in their line, the \"Huge Black Box\" which offers more interior space. It all depends on your needs. The \"Big Black Box\" weighs less than 2 pounds, the \"Huge Black Box\" weighs slightly over 4 pounds, which is also a considceration.  I like this case. So far I think it compares very well to the more expensive Pelican. Jerry","label":0}

{"text":"I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS. Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a \"sex only - no strings attached\" common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed. The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since \"Ghostbusters\" in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that. The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops... I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in \"Butterfly Effect\", \"The Guardian\", \"My boss's daughter\" and \"A lot like love\") and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of \"Notting Hill\", \"While you were sleeping\", \"When Harry meets Sally\" or \"Must love dogs\" - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of \"A lot like love\" (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!","label":0}

The graphics are a little dated, and ACII and Brotherhood mechanics were lacking up until he gains his hook blade in Revelations. Great games though, definitely worth buying.

Around the same time, I kept smelling a great cologne passing people on the sidewalk etc. For some reason I thought it was Calvin Klein, but when I checked at a store, I found I was wrong. Recently, by accident, I sprayed it on a card at a store, but didn't put it down right away when I realized my mistake. After a few moments, I caught another whiff of it. It was great and was the scent I had been trying to find all this time. What good luck. Not only that, but it is available at a good price all over. I got a bottle and use it often. A few sprays and I'm good to go. It lasts and lasts, but it is not overpowering. Great scent. I'm not good at describing scents, but I can say it is one of my favorites.

In any case, it has an attractive low luster finish and looks just like an expensive solid wood piece but for a the best price I found anywhere. Maybe it's because they're on clearance. Plenty of clearance below the cover for those thicker Audemars Piguet, Oris, Invicta or Hublot watches. About 55-57mm width accomodates wide watches such as most Panerai.

{"text":"What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for. The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb\/pinky finger goes... The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it. I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc. Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes. I am not sure what thenative specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it. As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out. The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45.","label":0}

I would give it five stars, but in the item description the only thing that it says is that it is made in the U.S.A by a quality company and when I received it the package unfortunately says made in China. If the only thing that you say about a product is \"Made in the U.S.A.\" don't lie and send me one made in China. ;(","label":0}

The grass that is coming in looks great. It is still too early to see how well it holds up but so far this product works very well and is easy to use. The only downside is that it is expensive. In the past I was able to buy a lot more seed coverage and my own mulch for less. This package is a lot easier to use and is actually worth it for smaller areas.","label":0}

{"text":"As an amateur, the price of the DNA5050 thrilled me. After getting it, I had a change of heart with my purchase. Don't get me wrong, I think that it's great. The truth is, it didn't really fit my needs but the price sold me. It's way cheaper than another stabiliser of similar make that I've been eyeing for a while and I guess it was an impulse buy. In any case, there's nothing wrong with it. I spent a few weeks getting to know this Glide Gear stabiliser--I particularly enjoyed the easy release mounting plate--but in the end, it was not for me (my cameras are on the smaller and lighter side of basic, most often used is a Sony pj200 camcorder) and carrying the 5050 for teeny tiny cameras just felt and looked stupid. I ended up trading it with a friend for oddly enough another Glide Gear product (the DNA1000), which had come out later. So all things considered, it was still a great purchase. I avoided wasting and losing out on an impulse buy, got a great stabiliser along with a few other things that matched well with my cameras, and I bagged a lot of good will too.","label":1}

{"text":"Great book, I have the hard copy and kindle version. It was an absolutely informative read as I have been interested in immersing myself into more EB-5 information. It honestly has given me a more high-level, high-ground perspective on the entire industry (especially the investors and developers). I love the step-by-step guide in both the distinctly separated investors and developers section. I thought that was very helpful in separating the roles of the two bigger players in the industry. There is just too much information about EB-5 floating around, specifically biased articles from the media. This book was able to give me a clear-headed idea of exactly how I should approach the people within the industry and how to explain it to those who are interested in entering the industry. EB-5 is definitely a complex industry and it's not something that is easy to just dive into. I believe the book was a great starting point for myself.","label":1}

I also spotted a very young Anthony Quinn, Ray Milland and Leo G. Caroll. Film and sound quality vary, but the stories are just so much fun. Up next is \"The Shadow,\" complete with more hot tech of the day: and inside look at 1930's radio broadcasting! I don't know if teens will love these, but they are before \"my time,\" and I still enjoy them. The best of this kind of collection I've seen.","label":0}
{"text":"I love to snack on hempseeds!! They're very tasty and they have a texture similar to sunflower seeds which I love. They make a great addition to salads and other light dishes because they give you just enough consistency to help feel more full. Since finding these organic seeds, I've noticed a serious change in my eating habits which has really helped me to look and feel better! I keep a bag with me at work to munch on throughout the day. There are instances where the shelled seeds aren't ideal though. For those, and for added flavor in my salads, I use hempseed oil () instead. It's all the same perks but in a different form. The taste is just as pure and if you blend the hemp oil and coconut oil together, you'll be hooked! It's the perfect balance of light and dark without being too heavy or bold tasting. I make up for my lack of omega-3 consumption with all my hempseeds. Even my husband loves them and he's a heavy chip and snack eater!","label":1}

It's cute and the colors are vibrant. Our daughter loved it and loves having her own suitcase. The quality is fine; not superior, not inferior. The suitcase got banged around a bit by the airline because we checked it and shows some scuffs as a result. However, it doesn't look too bad and the luggage will certainly get more use by our daughter. I wouldn't buy this if you intend to use it frequently because I don't think it will have that much longevity under circumstances where it is subject to repeated banging around. For infrequent to moderate use it's fine and holds a good amount of clothing.","label":0}

The respirator is when someone is coughing inside the room and there is no air circulating inside the room and the airconditioner is the only source of air, I told my children to use respirator so they will be safe.

{"text":"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it). I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible. I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula conditioner and (which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review). I replaced the shampoo with which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner. I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable. Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me. With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me. Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance. The bottom line is using and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable. I'll update the review with observations about the \"strengthening\" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer. First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner. Update: Jan 9 2014 Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice. What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better. Update: Feb 15 2015 I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result. Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.","label":0}

{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among. This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards. That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am. But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it. P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler.","label":0}

{"text":"Out of the box, there are a few major annoyances. The blue light is searingly bright, and there's no built in clean cycle. Granted, I don't know the effectiveness of the clean cycle - I was surprised it wasn't included. It brewed my coffee pretty slowly right out of the box and only got worse pretty quickly. After becoming painfully slow at brewing, I learned that coffee makers need to be cleaned with a 50\/50 mix of water and vinegar to keep clean. After researching various treatment methods, I settled on one and cleaned it. Bad idea, apparently. water stopped flowing completely. I assumed this was calcium buildup and dumped all the debris out and tried again. Also a bad idea. Within an hour, it popped loudly a few times and I came back to a mess of water and vinegar leaking out of the bottom. One of the hoses became disconnected and broke one of the plastic cuffs. This thing has sucked since I got it, but I'm giving it 2 stars because the water in my area is pretty hard - and I guess I'm partially to blame for not cleaning it every month. Pros: -Built in filter so you don't have to buy disposable ones. -Programming works well. -Unplugging it for a short time keeps the clock working, very handy when you shuffle your stuff around. Cons: -Died after 5 months. -Blue light is extremely freaking bright to the point where I have to face it a certain direction away from my bedroom. Seriously. WHY does it have to be so bright? -Became slow at brewing super quickly. -Basically exploded and leaked water and vinegar everywhere when I tried to clean it after just 5 months of use. Now 100% broken.","label":0}

{"text":"Five EFFECTIVE Stars! This Hallomall Solar Powered LED Outdoor Light is an easy-to-install, solar-powered, rechargeable light for various outdoor security or landscaping lighting needs. It comes with 3 components: the spotlight head which has 4 LEDs, the 5 3\/4 inch by 3 1\/4 inch by 1 inch thick solar cell, and the 7 1\/4 inch long plastic stake for securing it directly into the ground or using included hardware it can be attached to a secure place. I have an almost identical item that illuminates the yard. The difference is the Hallomall light is rated at 200 lumers. When installed it is compact, not taking up much space, less than a foot above the ground in height, and the spotlight angle and the solar cell angle are fully adjustable. There is a push button switch on the solar panel that can be set to \"Low\", \"Off\", and \"High\". It can be used to illuminate walkways, driveways, street addresses, plants, and darkened areas of a yard. In testing, comparing it to the other, very similar solar LED device staked right next to it, as expected, the 200 lumen Hallomall solar light dramatically \"out performed' the 80 lumen 4 LED solar light. When charged for 8 hours, the Hallomall 200 lumen LEDs can put out a circular beam of soft white light that effectively illuminates an area 10 to 15 feet away at approximately 120 degrees circular and it automatically turned on and stayed lit for the entire May night from 8 PM to 5:30 AM, then turned off automatically. When in place, the solar cell and light can be raised or lowered independently of each other at about 45 degrees each. Easy to assemble, easy to install, economical price, solar powered. Highly Recommended. Five BRIGHT Stars. (2 pack of Hallomall Bright Outdoor LED Solar Spotlight, ground stake, installation screws, and instructions.

It had, except that it shipped on 12\/5, when they received the defective unit, not when I sent in the original tracking number. To compound this delay problem, they sent the replacement unit via Fed Ex Ground (slower than the Pony Express) and it is now predicted to be thrown at my door on 12\/15, a full 10 days since it was mailed and almost two weeks since it should have been sent to me.

{"text":"I personally chose the f4 version of this range because it's cheaper and it's and L lens which means the optics used are way more better and you can achieve crispier photos.

It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos. The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay..

{"text":"This was a christmas gift for our almost 3yo son from his aunt - He LOVED it - all present opening stopped for about 30 minutes since he simply could not wait for us to get this out of the box so he could play with it - we had to let him play with \u00bd of it b\/c he was so excited!! It was hands down the best gift this year. It did take his dad a few minutes to assemble (like 10 minutes maybe) - but once put together it's worked almost flawlessly - my son LOVES using the elevator (& closing the gate every time) - then taking the car over with the crane - & he was able to use all of this entirely on his own after the first time we showed him. The only thing about this that could be designed a bit better would be the police car ramp (at the top of the elevator there's a ramp that holds a car - it's designed so when the car in the elevator is released onto the top level that ramp releases the car it's holding - so you end up with the police car chasing the yellow car). It's a bit of a pain to load - I have to use both hands to keep the release in place (since otherwise the ramp doesn't stay up) - or I have to hold it up while my son puts it in. This is the only bit he struggle to do on his own (he gets lucky every once in a while though). The pull out extension of the road on the bottom level is kinda weird - not sure why it's even necessary & can be a bit uncooperative at times when it comes to getting it back in - but it's not like that has any effect on the overall functionality of this product. I will admit - I am concerned about how long the crane will last - the spring is quite strong - so when my son pulls it over to the other level it snaps back quite quickly. Not concerned about it hurting my son - but am concerned that it will eventually crack the molded plastic or something....we'll see. But overall we're totally thrilled with this toy - as is my son. Even we've had fun playing with this thing...it's great. I imagine there may be some people who get some duds - whenever you involve mass production of molded plastic & a lot of little moving parts, that happens - but fisher price has always been pretty good at providing replacements for us when this has happened (can't speak to this specific product - but if you have trouble with yours I suggest just contacting fisher price - they'll probably send you a new one). Definitely recommend this for any toddler who loves cars.","label":0}
{"text":"Bought these to mount a Vizio speaker under a 39 Inch Samsng flat screen. Mounting worked well, but these brackets have a fair amount of flexibility which makes them \"feel like the speaker isn't secure. It is. The TV I mounted it to is on a swivel wall mount, and whenever the TV is adjusted the speaker sways back and forth a bit as the metal flexes. This is made from a fairly thin grade of metal, so it is certainly not rigid. In our setup, mounted to the TV with the wall mount at the same time, the brackets allow the sound bar to move L-R as well, which means it gets knocked off of \"level\" fairly easy. All that being said, I like the brackets, but not enough for five stars. It is adequate for what we need, but it does not exceed expectations.","label":0}

This twine won't cut into the soft stems like plastic or the harsher twines. It is green so you don't notice it. It seems to hold a fair amount of pull for staking plants and is kind to tomatoes. Great for encircling tall narrow spires to keep compact so winter snow doesn't weigh down side branches. At season end, staked plants are usually growing the way I want & remove it. If I forget to remove, It won't cut into the plant stems or small trunks; it comes undone or breaks. As I remove it and other plant trimmings, off to the compost it all goes. It works for me!","label":0}
{"text":"Another Obvious Knock-off of Original 5-Star McPolo's BabySoft Bib This brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually \"drives through all the red lights\" so to speak and \"borrows\" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to \"borrows\" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.","label":1}

{"text":"VIolence in movies is overdone. After too much you become numb to it, and might have a fleeting appreciation of the plot structure as a silver lining. The camera work is intimate, and the characters act like a real family. There is true chemistry here, and it isn't obviously plotted like say, the typical Jennifer Aniston movie. And it is because of this intimate bonds that when the lows come, they pack a wallop. I have never seen such wretched emotion in a movie before. I have never seen such natural camaraderie.

The only downside is it doesn't like my Tech-21 Mesh case so I have to pop it off at night.

If I had one of the older Tech-21's that do not have this feature it would fit with the case, but the case would have a flappy bottom. So I will gladly opt for popping the case off nightly. Don't expect this thing to like any case that does not have a completely open bottom.","label":0}

{"text":"It's a coffee table sized book packed full of natural history with brilliant color illustrations and loads of fascinating facts based on recent scientific discoveries. I remember getting toy plastic dinosaurs when I was a child and they were all grey or brown with hard smooth skins. Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose. Beginning with a brief exposition of the evolution of animals with backbones, the book goes from the Triassic to the Cenozoic (the rise of the first large mammals) Not just fascinating facts about dinosaurs, but also information about creatures that don't get a lot of attention, like Titanoboa, a gigantic South American snake that was as long as a school bus. There's also the two and half meter tall flightless bird and the Andrewsarchus. I've had this on book on my desk for a week now and it never fails to catch the attention of the numerous adults who wonder through. They inevitably pick it up and I've had to rescue it a couple of times from being carried off by rapt readers. This one is mine, but I know a couple of dinosaur obsessed children who are going to get copies as holiday gifts. I thoroughly recommend this book.","label":0}

{"text":"I'm so thankful for stumbling on this particular Chromium Picolinate and giving it a try. It has to be one of the best Chromium Picolinate's I have taken to date and I love that it comes in a small grape flavored chewable. You only need one a day to get up to Dr Andrew Weil's recommended 1000 mcg's and it's very apparent that the mcg's are correct. Solaray is a brand that I trust and have had good results with in the past. Sadly I have experimented with supplement brands I have never heard of before and found that the mcg's were likely a lot less than stated on the label. I'll be re-ording these by Solaray again and again. As others have mentioned it feels as if this lozenge form is being absorbed better. As with any supplement it's always important to talk with your physician first. The nice thing about Chromium Picolinate is it's been around for many years now and is pretty well known among health care givers unlike the newer fad supplements.","label":0}

{"text":"I love this TV. I did a lot of research before buying this model, so I was aware of most of it's shortcomings before purchase. There were some questions I had that I could not find answers for, so I thought I would write a review so I can answer these questions for other people. If you have a DualShock 4 controller (PS4 controller) you can pair it to the TV. Their primary reason is for Playstation Now, but the controller can also be used for any of the other Android apps you load on the TV. It has the Google Play store, and you're not limited to a handpicked selection from Sony. I was able to load a Super Nintendo emulator onto this TV. I was also able to put an app called Moonlight on here which allows me to stream my desktop PC games to this TV from across the house (needs Nvidia GPU). It has Netflix, Amazon VOD, and Youtube built in, which is nice since I don't need to use my Roku anymore! You can also download Plex, Kodi, or Hulu Plus from the Google Play Store. This TV isn't perfect. It does not come with 3D glasses and they are actually kind of hard to find and the Play Store was a little slow loading for me on occasion. I wish the price didn't jump from $798 up to $1299 for just 5\" more, but it's still a great value. As long as you have read the reviews on here and are aware of some of the minor problems beforehand I think you will enjoy this TV a lot.","label":0}

{"text":"A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5\" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a \"I love my SSD\" sticker. Write performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes (\"dd\" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB\/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5\" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place. The \"sweet spot\" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious). The OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage. A fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba. Recommended.","label":0}

I agree that his consistent message of pushing against the world of petroleum powered vehicles a bit tiresome. But his practical recommendations for dealing with the issues that confront him in his travels, especially regarding his trike, are quite helpful, and his adventures have a real ring of authenticity that I found particularly interesting. You really have the feeling that you are there with him as these adventures come up from day to day, so overall, a very worthwhile read, and definitely recommended. I only wish there were in the book some of his often mentioned pictures that he took along the three different overland trips that he took over the 6 years.","label":0}

I do have somewhat wide feet and sometimes do better in a wide-width shoe, so I'm surprised at how large these run. Not sure yet if I will need an 8.5 or an 8. Update: The size 8.5 seemed right for me, but after wearing the shoes for a day, I discovered that the ankle collar on one shoe was too small, and the inner part was angled inward too much, causing irritation and soreness.

{"text":"Sophie Winters is a drug addict. Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren't hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer. But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders. FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her. FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.

{"text":"I'm going to have to get an external streaming video product (Roku?) because the \"famed\" Vizio Internet Apps are getting really long in the tooth, and there's no apparent update coming. The Netflix app is so old it lacks all kinds of features that are commonplace with other Netflix boxes, like the ability to sequence to the next video in a series. Each time we power up this puppy, we have to manually search through sometimes dozens of episodes we've already watched to get to the next one we haven't seen. It doesn't even group the episodes into seasons (season 1, 2, etc.), you have to scroll through ALL of the episodes to get to the one you want. There are lots of other Netflix and Amazon gotcha's that make using it truly painful. For example the Amazon app has no \"My list\", so you can't make any attempt at saving a favorite show for future viewing. Ridiculous. It's not that I expect Vizio to compete head-on with Roku (for example) but they could at least try to keep current. As a plain old HD tv this unit is fine. My 2c. Further info, 9\/16\/2013: Just spoke with Vizo tech support. According to him they have several different main versions of firmware, and they have to work \"hand in hand\" with each of the app providers (i.e. Netflix) to coordinate every update. Long story short, they *may* get around to updating any particular firmware version at some point, but they are seriously behind at this time. To me, sounds like a losing battle. Roku here we come...","label":0}

{"text":"This watch replaces an older Casio with the same functions. The old one is very scratched due to a hard life. I love the new watch as it has hands which contrast with the white face (this was a problem with the old watch). The new one is a bit thicker than the old (by .050) but it has buttons which are larger and easier to press and the face is larger. The thing that is most important to me is that it is fairly thin (.407\"). Most watches these days stand tall on the wrist making them difficult to access wearing a long sleeved shirt.","label":0}

{"text":"Great fountain for the price - about 1\/2 price of that in the big-brand pet stores. Has adjustable water flow (great flow!) that can be turned up or down easily. Simple to take apart to clean. We have a lot of minerals in our water, so I clean it about once every 2-3 weeks. While this would last with water in it for several weeks, I like to change out the water at least once a week to keep it fresh (although the charcoal filter does a good job of that). I have one cat in our household, but I would imagine a home that had more pets might want to change it more frequently. After some months, sometimes I notice that fur (my cat has thick, long-hair) might get caught in the pump and it will slow down some, but with this new model, the fountain is easily dismantled to get to the pump (other models weren't so easy to get to it) and give it a good rinsing. Quick to do: takes less than 2 minutes to remove top part, get at and take out pump, rinse it off, put the pump back in and replace the top. Easy-peasy! The water flows fairly quietly, but there is a little bit of a soft fountain water noise - which I really like. Sounds like a far-off stream, so it is a very pleasant sound. I know my kitty likes this fountain, because not only does she have nice, clean water all the time, but she liked to drink from the faucets before (which I didn't really care for) and now with the fountain, she'll drink directly from the water coming out of the spout so she is happy. :-) I have had this same brand before (but in a larger size reservoir), and liked it well enough that this is my 3rd purchase over the past many years. I have tried other brands\/types, but I like this one the best as there is no dripping or leaks (from the unit... when we had the dog, he would lap the water messily and drool\/drip it all over the place - not due to any malfunction of the fountain though). This is a well-made and sturdy unit; if\/when I ever need to replace it, I would get the same one again. Very happy with the quality and materials.","label":0}

Alot of the time I have it hooked up to my computer becouse it gives me realy quick controll of the volume going to my speakers or headphones. It Gives me 4 outputes, all with there own volume controls. Its case is made of metal so its pritty rugged. The sound is graet, I never even have to max out the volume on it. I never seem to lose any sound quality. It uses 1\/4\" stereo jacks, wich is no problem for me cus I always use my vintage headphones. I ordered converters for other headphones and audio equipment I sometimes use. I would prob advise using some velcro if you are going to have it in one spot all the time cus it slides easly. Its nice and small but has to be plugged into the wall so you cant realy use it on the go. Over all it was well worth the money.","label":1}

The fact that it gives my horizontal and vertical measurements perfect alignments, I recommend it to anyone. Handling it is simple and the black color is preferably as it does not fade easily. For the additional batteries included, thank a lot for that. They are the long lasting type and it seems that I will not be buying others soon.

{"text":"Without the extras, it could easily serve as sort of a a daily carry heavy duty college book backpack. I'm 5'8\" & 160 lbs. & when I wear it it doesn't look over-sized or burdensome on my back. Fully packed, it's not going to stick out above my head or stick out from my body 3'on the back. Yet, it'll hold a folded riding crop with no problem. The small removable deployment pack on the lower back isn't so low that it bounces off my butt. The slightly ribbed and padded back plate is not made of rubber or silicon as it looked in some of the photo's. It's a padded vented canvas material that has been molded or formed into a ribbed 1\/2 chevron design that rests against your back. The straps are relatively wide, but not as thickly padded as I had hoped. I'll update this review after a few months of use & let everyone know if the straps dig in too much. The molle strips on the top and middle of the back are a relatively short at 6\" long. I'm accustomed to 8 1\/2.\" Six inches is probably OK for the average guy with an average backpack but it's almost too short for many of us. The molle strips on the side are only 3 1\/2\" long.","label":1}

One thing we didn't realize we needed was a small dry bag to pack different things in (towel, change of clothes, phone, camera, lunch, whatever) to bring with us, because the kayak lets in water and things get damp very easily. This bag is perfect for that- it's very roomy, but still compact enough that it fits neatly in the boat without taking much room. The orange color is a benefit, because if it does go overboard, or if you leave it on the shore, you can easily spot it from a distance. So far, we've not had the opportunity to set it in the water and leave it for several hours to test just *how* waterproof it is, but it has held up in regular use and in rainy conditions. Perfect bag for kayaking and other water-based sports.","label":0}

{"text":"A tragic story of 16-year-old James Dallas Egbert who left his university dorm room to enter the tunnels under the college with the goal of committing suicide. Instead of dying, he woke one night later and went to recover with a male friend. On top of depression he was a closet homosexual. His parents reported him missing. When that made the news, his male friend panicked and passed him to another male friend and then on to another until all of them were panicked thinking they were going to get blamed for his murder or abduction. Eventually the poor boy makes it home to his parents, but not until after aother failed suicide attempt. It doesn't end well either. It's a good read, but not for fun.","label":1}

The various functions are very useful for the sports man but most importantly the strap and design are really well built for the active lifestyle.

{"text":"We bought the large size for our very docile and well behaved standard poodle and gave it a test run while we went to church. We came home an hour later and found her out, and when we investigated the crate we realized she must have put pressure on the zipper and unzipped it. We took a luggage lock and locked the two zippers together, and went out for another short trip. We came home and found her out again, only this time she pushed hard enough against the door to rip the zipper out at the seam. We returned the damaged crate (Amazon refunded us) and went with a sturdier plastic crate with metal bar door. I loved the looks of this and I'm sad it didn't work! I think any dog, no matter what size, is going to look at this crate as a challenge and work to get out of it.","label":0}

{"text":"I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star. It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built. Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff. This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon. Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it's on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets. The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of. Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic \"New Hope\" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH. A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought. Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it.","label":1}

{"text":"Farberware BBQ Instant Read Thermometer with Large Digital Face, by Farberware. When I received this thermometer from Amazon, I was a bit disappointed. It is 1 \u00bc\" wide and 5\" long. I already have one of these small ones that are more difficult to read as I get older. The write-up on this BBQ thermometer gave the impression that it was larger. The product description said that it would be 10\" long. This is false advertising by Amazon, and one reason that I hate to buy things from a catalog. If it is broken or not as advertised, you have to go through the headache of returning it through the mail. At least if you buy something in an old style brick and mortar store, you can go there and return it more easily. In the same shipment, I also received from Amazon a broken Salter kitchen scale that was made of cheap plastic with chrome paint. The description of that item gave the impression that it was chrome covered metal, not plastic. More false or misleading advertising by Amazon. I give up. I will shop at a local kitchen store instead, where I can see what I am getting, and can evaluate the product in the store. Fortunately, I can still drive a car and I do not have to depend on catalogs. The one good thing that I can say about this product, is that it gave exactly the same temperature reading as the one I already had.

It has only basic features such as an alarm and timer but what more does a thirteen year old by need with his watch?

{"text":"Other reviews have mentioned this, but do not underestimate what a piece of cr*p this is. HOWEVER, this was the very narrowest coat rack I could find online and was exactly what I needed for my tiny hallway in my rented apartment. The box arrived beaten to hell. UPS had tried to tape it back together and warned me there were \"screws falling out of the box.\" Great. I got it home and put it together, with the following caveats: - I had to go to the hardware store for 2 more (missing) screws - One of the pipes was bent during shipping, and I couldn't fit the pieces together. Luckily, the hardware store guy bent it back for me with a pair of pliers. - The black coating is scratched \/ beaten to hell in a few places. This isn't a big deal, as I plan to spray paint the whole thing white. - The bench, as other people have said, is ugly and cheap. ALSO, I could not for the life of me figure out how to secure it to the frame. It just sort of sits on top, I guess. The directions (which lacked any words, BTW) do not have any picture for attaching the seat, and there seem to be no parts for that purpose. I don't know. I'm also going to spray paint the bench and\/or buy some upholstery fabric to fix it up. In sum, if you have a tiny space, this is the smallest coat rack available. However, be prepared to spend some time fixing it to make it work.","label":0}

I wear them every day though and don't oil them often so it's not a big deal but I do wish they held up a little better since they cost well over $100.

{"text":"I had a hard time rating this, as I really like the piece, but it has a major design flaw. The carving on this is beautiful. It looks higher-end than it is- if you want it to keep looking that way, a low-traffic usage is key. You need to be careful with it, as the finish dings easily. Which brings me to the finish: it's a deep red-brown: think cherry mixed with mahogany. The color looks NOTHING like the picture on my monitor. I was actually pleasantly surprised, since it matches my hardwood floors and a lot of my furniture, but if you are looking for a lighter, more \"golden\" finish, you are going to be disappointed. I bought this to hang as a mantel. I figured it would come with the jagged \"toothy\" hangers that are used to typically hang such things, and well- no. Two keyhole hangers. The main problem here is that the top of the keyhole opening is flush with the underside of the mantel shelf. So the shelf will actually be resting on whatever you use to hang it, screws\/nails\/etc.-which will hold it up. But if bumped or pulled on, the shelf will probably slip right off the fasteners and the wall. If you're dealing with a brick surface like I am, this is even more problematic, because the shelf will get scratched up, and whatever is on the shelf will probably smash to pieces. If you want this, my advice is to upgrade the wall fasteners to something more secure. If you don't feel like fiddling with it, you may want to find another shelf.","label":0}

{"text":"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel () and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties. An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does. At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.","label":0}

The olive color is more of an olive-gray, so it can easily be worn with outfits that one would not ordinarily wear with olive.

{"text":"I purchased the Nero sink and get lots of oohs and ahhs over its unique styling. The color is a deep charcoal, but not black. The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue. My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with warm water\/dish soap\/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish. 18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it.","label":1}

{"text":"ESV Single Column Legacy Bible - 9781433530876 - Trutone Brown\/Cordovan I just received this Bible today, and I'm very impressed. It's strictly a black-letter, paragraphed text Bible: no references (or rather, only a very few), no study notes, no introductions. The page layout is very much like a \"normal\" book, i.e., single column instead of the usual two columns of text. The only place where the publisher has continued the typical practice of Bible layout is by including chapter and verse numbers within the text itself. I'd have preferred to see these numbers consigned to a margin (like the original edition of the New Jerusalem Bible), but I really don't mind the verse numbers. Unlike some ESV Bibles, the verse numbers are not in bold, so they don't stick out so much. A wonderful feature of the page layout is that subject headings are not allowed to break the flow of text. They are printed on the page but appear in the margin beside the text, so you can ignore them if you want. Another reviewer complained that the font is too small. I disagree. I think this font is quite readable -- it's not large, but it's certainly larger than the font in most Bibles. To me it seems just right. The Bible overall is bigger and heavier than I expected -- and I would honestly have preferred it to be smaller. This Bible is not something you will be able to easily toss in a backpack or briefcase. But the size feels \"right.\" In other words, it's inviting. I find that I keep wanting to pick it up, open it and start reading. Two other minor problems for me: in my opinion the white space on each page is excessive, especially in the area beneath the text. The bottom margin is fully 1 1\/4 inches, but the top margin seems to be just under 3\/4 of an inch. It's surely odd that the top and bottom margins are not equal. Also, I find the spine is rather stiff. Since the inner margin on each page is pretty small, I have to carefully, but with some difficulty, bend open the gutter to make thepages lie flat enough to read without difficulty. (This is a strong contrast to the ESV compact Bible I also have -- the pages open flat very easily in that Bible.) I expect this will get to be less of a problem over time. Yet all these criticisms are picayune. This is a beautiful Bible. I would go so far as to say I've been waiting for a Bible as attractive and inviting as this one for years. It has class. It has beauty. Sitting on my desk, it simply *wants* to be read. Another improvement in this Bible over previous ESV editions is that the publishers have dropped the very short, and to me simply worthless, introductions that they've put into many of their other text Bibles, such as the compact Bibles. The latter is small enough to fit into a pocket, but the publisher crams the silly one-paragraph introductions into it. But they're gone from the Legacy Bibles. On the other hand, there's still a short (75-page) concordance and eight pages of maps in the back. Not really desirable for me, but okay, no problem. Maybe if I ever need to find a verse reference with a common word in it and don't have access to google, I'll use the concordance. But today I tested it with the first word that came to mind -- \"Amminadab\" -- and it's not in this concordance. Oh well. And this is a great translation. I'm not someone who gets into the \"translation wars.\" I like lots of translations -- NRSV, New Jerusalem, New Living, as well as oddball versions like those of Richmond Lattimore, Reynolds Price, Everett Fox, Robert Alter, etc.; they're all great to me. And of course even hoary old King James is not to be sneered at. But more and more I find myself using as a \"basic\" translation the ESV: it's traditional, it's accurate, its tone is about as \"high\" as you're going to get in a modern version, and it's literal enough that many literary elements of the original languages come through. Maybe it can't always be instantly comprehended by a sixth-grader, but so what? That's what commentaries and other versions are for. In conclusion, I love this Bible, and I think anyone who wants a Bible for actual *reading* -- not just referencing or giving as a gift or carrying around as a fashion accessory -- will love it too. My final score: 9.5 out of 10. PS Now I'm just waiting for the soon-to-be-released Clarion Reference ESV from Cambridge: who will win the \"reader's Bible\" award -- Crossway or Cambridge? The world waits with eager anticipation ... EDIT: I just noticed this Bible is actually larger than the Crossway website claims it is. Crossway says it's 6\" x 9\"; in fact it's 6.5\" x 9.5\". That extra half-inch makes a difference: the Bible is bigger and heavier than it needs to be. Since a half-inch could easily be removed from the very wide margins on the pages without affecting the size of the type, it's puzzling the size was increased. But if you like wide margins for note-taking, this will be a plus. On the down side, that extra half-inch means this Bible won't fit into a standard medium size Bible case -- and a standard large size Bible case is a bit too large. Of the Bible cases I've tried, the one that fits best is the large thinline size made by Gregg. (A better option than a Bible case would be a tablet computer sleeve like the .) As for weight, keep in mind this Bible is rather heavy at 2 lbs 10 oz. Also, regarding verse numbering, I just noticed the Legacy ESV does place verse numbers in the margin for poetic texts such as the Psalms, and it works quite well. Finally, after spending some more time reading from the Legacy ESV, I notice the spine is quickly becoming \"wrinkled\" -- it's very soft and apparently is *so* soft its shape is becoming distorted from holding the Bible open for any length of time. It's not a serious problem, and this is, after all, an imitation leather binding, so I don't expect perfection. But it's too bad all the same. Better quality bindings will perhaps not have this problem.","label":0}

If you're anything like me, you probably would benefit from watching some of the demonstration videos about the toy box before trying to create your own games. Once you do that, you can have endless hours of gaming fun. It's like having an endless amount of games at your fingertips. Your kids will use their analytical skills and creative genius to create entirely new games and worlds within the existing game, which means the fun can last forever each time you play!

{"text":"Assembly was unpleasant - directions weren't clear, parts are not easy to discern, and the tubes required some muscle on my part to assemble. However, if you are willing to put in an hour or two, you should find that the final product works better than imagined. I purchased along with the Swim Time 16-Feet x 32-Feet Rectangular 12-mil Solar Blanket for In Ground. My biggest fears were (1) that the tubes would collapse under the weight of the cover when it was rolled up and (2) the reel would be unstable and move around while rolling. However, neither problem has occurred (so far after one month). Only problem is that sometimes I need to pull the cover taut if I notice it starts to bunch up in the middle as I crank it up. Otherwise, it makes a world of difference covering\/uncovering as compared to dealing with a cover without a reel. It's smooth enough that my wife and children can work on their own. According to the reps at the local pool store, pool water needs to be exposed to air several hours a day and this reels makes that chore a lot more tolerable.","label":0}

{"text":"What the hell is up with these reviews? I've noticed on this phone, and many like it across Amazon, the ratings are hit-or-miss. Also, there are random reviews in spanish, which to me, is pointless since less than 10% of the world's population speaks it fluently. English is the universal language of the internet. The product is great. It's my first \"smartphone\" ever. I have big fingers, yet no problems with the keypad. I really like the keypad vs. touchscreen. Sending over 3 sentences on a touch screen is a pain in the ass. The Blackberry 9930 is one of the best choices for communicating online via messaging. #1 thing I've noticed: call voice clarity. Wow. It sounds like a land-line. The voice on the other end sounds as if I'm in a radio broadcast station, using high end audio equipment in an acoustically paneled room. This is likely one of the clearest and warm sounding phones on the market. The screen is extremely responsive. No lag whatsoever. Holds a charge very well (even with WiFi \"ON\"). Still exploring the many uses this phone offers. It's a great triumph in human civilization to build such great devices. I'm going to enjoy this Blackberry and take care of it for a long time. *Regular camera and video camera failed to start when clicked upon. This is normal with the outdated firmware that comes with this product. If your blackberry has any unresponsive issues with apps, just download the latest firmware update from the blackberry website and you're good to go*","label":0}

This one is for the Compact and Sub-Compact PX4, so it will NOT sit on your full sized PX4 rail properly and therefore will NOT fit as securely as you'll need it to. This one is the FQ150C (the \"C\" is for Compact) (ASIN: B0051W6CQ8) For the full sized PX4 Storm you'll need to order the \"Aim Sports 150 Lumens Flashlight with Qrl Color Filtered Lenses\" model number FQ150 (no \"C\") (ASIN: B00551H96W). This FQ150C light is VERY bright, very solid and very nice. The quick detach mount is an excellent feature if you desire easy attachment\/removal. Also, it does have a temporary \"ON\" setting. Once you've pressed the switch to turn the light \"ON\" you can press the switch lightly to temporarily turn the light \"OFF\", releasing the light pressure will turn the light back \"ON\". Then, to turn the light completely \"OFF\" depress the button fully. At a little over $30, this is a very good buy. I would recommend it.

{"text":"I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level. Fit Deck Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary. About $16\/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock. Strength Stack 52 In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him. The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before. About $16\/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase. Workout Labs This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards. PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did. The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these. I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.","label":1}

{"text":"What a great game. I never played the original so I'm coming to this version fresh. The thing I love about it is that it is something different for the Playstation 3. The options and different difficulty levels on this game open it up for a lot of replay. I played through about four times when I originally got the game a year ago. I've taken time off from it to play some other games and have come back to it having forgotten the strategies I used so it's been fun relearning them. The graphics are pretty good, I really can't speak to the graphics quality but I enjoy the special effects (the explosions, gun fire, ect). The art style is appealing but not hyper realistic. The game has great customization for the soldiers. Some people care about that type of thing while others don't. I personally enjoy working to advance my troops up through the ranks and trying to give each his or her own personal appearance. There is a wide variety of skills to assign but as I remember some are decidedly better than others strategy wise. If fun and hard turn based games are something you might be interested in I couldn't recommend any game more highly than this one.","label":0}

{"text":"This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong. But the foam sprayer is of poor quality. When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose\/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor.

The device is relatively small but obviously the box end is larger than a single DVI or VGA adapter, and measures about twice the length of an Apple DVI dongle and about 70-80% the length of most of my 3rd party dongles. On the other hand, it is thinner than my other dongles which helps in the bag. Considering you'd need three separate adapters, you could be reducing your carry weight by over 4-fold.","label":1}

{"text":"I have been trying several brands of Manuka honey lately, trying to find the one that offers the most healing potential for the best price and I'm not sure that this is it. The UMF is lower than the other honey I am currently using. Though the Airborne honey has a lovely taste, I am not sure that the lower UMF is actually enough to heal anything. On the nights that I take a tsp of Airborne,I seem to have more congestion than when I use one of the other brands with a higher UMF. Also, the jar arrived with the top cracked and honey leaked all over the packaging. I'm not sure if I will order this again.","label":0}

{"text":"I am soo glad I got these for my daughter!She is 1 years old and she loves them.These are great to have fun and educate your little one at the same time.I loved that you get 60 pieces total.Well worth the price.Your little one can learn their numbers,letters,& words. My daughter loves to stick them everywhere in the tub and she hates when bathtime is over.She really enjoys bathtime.We also use the flashcards outside of bathtime too which is great. She is learnin her words right now. We chose the boys girls because of the vibrant colorful colors they had. the girls option of colors is just purple and pink not very much colors to look at. it makes her bathtime more enjoyable. They are a very good quality foam and is durable.My little accidentally bit into a letter and it left a little indentation. But it did not tear or anything very durable. You get a lot of pieces for your money. Great for bathtime play and playtime play as well.","label":0}

This little device allows your phone to ring when you want it to. NOT when some harrasser wants it to. All one has to do. Is connect your phone line to the device. The device then hooks into your phone jack on the wall. It was a toggle switch. Marked Red for Off Blue for On.  You will need to get one for each of your phones. As it will not work on an exstention phone unless you buy another for it. . So buy two. It will save you a lot of unwanted being woken up in the morning at 8AM or at Night at 8PM. No one has a right to call your number without your consent. After all YOU pay the Phone Bill. No one else. I have an unlisted number, Caller ID and Call Blocking. But they can get past all that with a little help from \"Their \" Friends at the Phone company  So if your paying for an UNLISTED PRIVATE Number as I am. Thank Your Phone Company for passing it out. As they have done more than once. It will do you no good to change your phone number. Pay a fee to the phone company to have a new numnber. And the VERY NEXT DAY the SCUM BAGS have your new number AGAIN !! They have a \"Crystal ball\".... you know....Or a \"Good Ole Boy\"... in the Phone Company who \"charges you for a new number\". \"Bills you for an unlisted ,Private Number\".

The negative, bad and angry reviews on here are pretty funny to me but I dont think ADWD was downright awful as many people do. I have no problem with the \"big cliff-hanger\" and the minor POV characters, for the most point, were interesting. Dany's story has been dragging and the amount of dead characters coming back is kinda comical but I still found myself engaged and excited to keep reading.

{"text":"These are applied the exterior glass on your car and the manufacturer claims that they can dramatically improve you wet weather driving visibility without window wipers. Well, I don't know about dramatically but they certainly do improve the visibility through windows when wet weather driving. I must say I was impressed with how easy it is to install. When we had a down pour recently I hardly had to use the wipers. One thing to note however, don't put this on your side windows as I did because you will have all the water rushing in if you crack them open for any reason. This even works on glass shower doors and stops them from steaming up as frequently, which reduces how often I have to clean the shower.","label":1}

{"text":"I bought this flashlight for my dad. I had it on my wishlist for a while, but nobody bought it for me, so I figured I would get it for my dad. I usually buy him 1-2 flashlights a year as gifts. Kind of a running joke in our family that he knows he's either getting a flashlight or a pocket knife from me for a gift. He said this is one of the best flashlights he's ever owned. In addition to him owning countless flashlights over the years, please also know he was a firefighter and used countless lights on the job as well. This one gives off a blindingly concentrated beam, but still gives a nice lighter glowing outer ring to let you see things even if they aren't directly in the main beam. This flashlight will light up an entire room inside a house and can EASILY spotlight tree tops outside at 200 yards. Highly recommended for camping, as an emergency light in your car, or any other use you may have. Two other benefits I've found to this light is that it's made of rubber, so your hand won't freeze in 3 seconds if you pick it up in the middle of winter if it's been in your car. (Assuming you aren't wearing gloves). Also, it's not round, so it won't go rolling off the counter or table if you set it down on it's side. One downside about the rubber, is that it's not dog-chew proof as my dad learned. His still works, but it has some teeth marks on the battery cap now. Ok, this review is long enough. Bottom line, while I can rattle off 10 different lights and why you should own all of them, you can't go wrong with this one. My dad and I both highly recommend it. The battery life is also fairly impressive for the amount of light this thing puts out.","label":0}
{"text":"For moving, storage or utility purposes one can always go to the local grocery or liquor store and get plenty of free boxes... if you catch them at the right time. But unless you know someone there, chances are that you'll end up with a motley mess of varying size cartons that may or may not suit your needs. A personal fAVorite for general, casual storage are these . They'rs also available in packs of 5, 8, 12, 15 or 20, but do a quick math check to see which quantity fits your needs and cost per box. If you check the product page, at the time of this review, you'll see that these cartons are available in large, medium and small sizes, along with with a small\/medium kit. This review is on the SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes, Small, 15 x 12 x 10 Inches, Pack of 10, which is the size and quantity that I've used most frequently \u25c6 Likes: + 15x12x10-inch small size boxes after assembly; convenient and multi-purpose + Lift-off lid, has easy to carry handles at each end; no tape required + Double end double bottom construction; offers strength for heavy-duty moves and storage + Good for general household items, kitchen & bathroom goods; excellent for paper files + Easy set-up construction; lid ships attached to prevent lid loss, tears off for use + Made from strong 32 ECT C-Flute Kraft corrugated board; reusable and recyclable + Construction: 75% post-consumer recycled material content + Uniform size; stackable five-high or more depending on weight of contents \u25c6 Dislikes - None at all; have reordered this size and quantity The above items list the subjective high points of these reusable cartons. For this reviewer, it's the uniformity of the size that matters most, as they can be easily stacked. Depending on the weight of the contents, these 15x12x10-inch cartons can be easily stacked five or six high with little danger of toppling. There's a section below the handle opening at the end of each box where you can note the contents of each, which is highly suggested. When I received my first order as an Amazon Vine selection, I wondered how easy they were to put together. As that turned out, it was only the first one that seemed slightly tricky, and once done it all made sense. Assembly is easy, and the directions are printed on the bottom of each box. Just follow the numbered steps and all should go just fine. Hints: though no tape is needed, if you plan to use these for storage, you may wish to put a small strip of standard 1.88\" to 2\" wide packaging tape over the handle openings. That should be enough to keep out any small critters that may reside in your storage area. And of course it's not advisable to store any foodstuffs other than canned goods in these cartons. Enough said on that. These Bankers Box SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes are an excellent choice for moving and storage of your paper files, magazines, books, general household items, kitchen & bathroom goods. Just pick the size that best suits your personal needs, but remember that cartons can become heavier than you expect, especially with books and paper. The best part is that these uniform-sized boxes are very stackable, and can be used over and again. JW \u25aa 6\/20\/2015","label":0}

{"text":"This car seat seems like a decent inexpensive solution for your child. Pros: - Small, can fit in the middle of a small sedan and still fit 2 adults at either side without much hassle. - Easy to install... Some other car seats leave a lot to be desired. - Will last from 5 to 40 pounds, which is about from birth till about 3 years of age. (obviously varies depending on child, this is just a rough estimate) This is for back facing carseat. - Goes up to 65 pounds for forward facing. - Buckles work fine. My other Graco had buckles \"voluntarily recalled\" this one has the newer styles already, so I don't foresee a recall. They are easy to adjust and to buckle on or off. Cons - I have other Graco car seats, and the cushion\/fabric seems like it's better quality than this. This was a small disappointment. Overall, if you are looking for a first carseat, and got less than 150 to spend, this is a good choice.","label":0}

It picks up in the same universe as the authors previous Webcomic - Narbonic - and features a small and overworked government social services agency who deals with the creations of mad scientists and helps them integrate into society.

The only thing I did not like was that the compartment on the top of the bag, near the handle (the one that only goes a quarter of the way down, not the full compartment) the zipper was relocated up to the top of the bag (before it was about 4-5 inches below the top. Now, if you are carrying a bag on top of this one, you can no longer access that zipper without removing the bag on top of it. Very Inconvenient.
