{"text":"I bought this at a local mart store for under six bucks. It's a nice sized bottle of make up remover and really does take off make up that other removers leave behind. I only use the \"stay-put paint-on\" type of lipstick that doesn't wash off with normal soap, cold cream, baby oil or vaseline. This does take it right off, though. It's also great at taking off waterproof mascara and \"stay-put\" foundation. For the size of the bottle, it's a real bargain compared to the little bottles of remover that I've bought in the past to remove my lipstick for the same price or higher. I will definitely buy it again when I run out.","label":0}

None of the pegs are secured in the holes... but there's 2 pieces to that process and the smaller piece the glue must have just wore off! So basically I have a wooden post and a bunch of pieces. None are able to hold up puppets. AVOID THIS PRODUCT! Original review 2\/2014 - This puppet tree is perfect for a small collection. We have a lot of the Folkmanis ones and it worked really well with those. This product is made great. It was easy to put together and the wooden posts just slide right in.","label":0}
{"text":"I bought this in November, 2011. It worked fantastically until it just stopped working 4 months later. I spoke to others that own one, and the same thing for everyone - the longest one lasted of the 3 other people I talked to was 7 months. I talked to a Tivo rep about my account once, mentioned the remote issues and his comment back was \"yea, a lot of people are saying that\". It's too bad because it's so helpful to be able to type in words at the search prompt with a keyboard instead of having to click the arrow keys to spell out words. Honestly a keyboard like this should come standard with a system that is reliant on typing words in anyway, in my opinion. I Love my TiVo service, just this remote was a bust...and they are so expensive too. -D","label":0}
{"text":"I used to buy and play with only brand-new balls. Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them. So, now I only use second hand Callaways. Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them. Or so I thought. People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was. I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious. I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not. That's how I decided on this gadget. I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball. The contraptions works like this: It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover. There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball. The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need. It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of \"clicks\" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number. - It's not the best device: - It's hard to screw the bottom thing on. You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials. - The inner ring is steady, but not great. It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character. It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful. I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady. -- It does work OK: - The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge. - It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently. ---- The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess. I do recommend this device. I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!","label":0}

Without actually deploying the system by mounting the cameras, I was able to test its features and these are my findings. Cameras are clear and good quality. The remote app really needs improvement. Some days i can see my cameras, while other days i cannot. After several factory resets, i was able to get it to work but is still not 100% reliable. I will only be using these cameras 1.5 months out of the year for my Christmas light show display.

{"text":"This is my 9th Soundblaster product, and 12th Creative product. They have always impressed me until now. I run audio out via SPDIF to a NAD pre-amp, then to 4 NAD power amps, finishing at mixed brands of in wall speakers and subs throughout the house. The level of the SPDIF out was weak compared to my previous sound card(s), and required more than twice the amplification. I am not going to be running my amps full tilt all the time to make up for a weak input signal. The built in headphone amp is a joke. Volume level\/power was no better than plugging direct into the laptop's factory soundcard. No EQ is bundled with this unit, I had to install old Creative software. Burn option in Creative MediaSource 5 magically disappeared, I consulted customer service, and was told this product does not support MediaSource (MediaSource won't burn unless a qualifying Creative device is connected). How can YOUR software not support YOUR hardware?! How does the Creative sound card model I am using have anything to do with transferring files to a CD?!?! Creative did not respond to further inquires on this compatibility issue. Sound quality lacks as compared to previous SoundBlasters, it was dull and flat. Overall sounded poor, through a mix of Klipsch, Polk, Boston Acoustics, and even a single pair of Martin Logan Edges. Out of no where, a click and pop appeared between tracks in MediaSource. Said clicks\/pop not present with previous PC\/Soundcard. I have submitted for a refund. I am going back to my desktop PC, with a Soundblaster X-Fi Titanium until I figure out a better laptop option. Considering the Cambridge Audio DacMagic Plus or axing the computer all together for a network media center. Everyone is entitled to a flop. Creative proved themselves to me over years of use and many products. I can get over a single flop. But not responding to additional inquiries regarding product quality and compatibility issues is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. I have used SoundBlaster exclusively since my 8bit ISA mounted \"Game Blaster\" card purchased from Radio Shack in the late 80's early 90's. Creative has lost a decades long customer not from product quality, but from poor customer service. Shame on you, and good riddance. This was run on: Dell Latitude E6540 Intel Core i7-4810MQ @ 2.8ghz 8Gb RAM Win7 64 bit Sound card was purchased direct from the Creative website, not through Amazon.

The focusing speed is very fast, silent and accurate. This lens is as sharp as the prime 50mm f1.8 and 85mm f1.8 lens just by looking at the picture at 100%. Canon has the same 70-200mm F4, and I still have that lens, but I can say that this Nikon version beats it hand down. However, this seems to be a bit heavier than the similar Canon version, but the difference is small. Highly recommended!","label":0}

{"text":"They say that PG Tips black tea is the number one brand in Britain. One taste will certainly show you why. This is rich and full of flavor. I think that even if you are not really a big tea drinker this would be the perfect brand to try. This totally blows away anything that you are likely to find here in the supermarket. You will also appreciate the fact that the flavor and consistency produced by this brand is one of the better that you will find. It is very nice for drinking every day. Of course, there are also those times when you want to add a little bit of variety to things. In that case, might I suggest taking a look at this item:  This one gives you some interesting black tea choices. Although I had heard about Earl Grey tea from watching Captain Picard in Star Trek: TNG, actually trying this was quite amazing. For those times when I want something a bit spicy, I really go in for the sweet hot cinnamon. The other option is tea that combines almonds with a fruit flavor finish--you will end up loving this! Try these today.","label":1}

{"text":"I never use my dishwasher because I prefer to hand wash my dishes. Since my sink is pretty big, this has been working perfectly during the rare times when I want to use a rinse basket to drain the dishes before I dry them. It has also been working very well as a counter-top dish drying rack as long as I put a drying mat underneath (since it does not come with a drain board). I never liked dish drainers so I use a drying mat similar to . However, sometimes I wash so many dishes that they don't fit on the mat. With this rack, I can get 8 large fiesta dinner dishes and a couple of small bowls upright so that I don't have to wash the dishes in shifts. I also sometimes wash the dishes and put them in the rinse basket and let them drain before putting the entire contraption with dishes on the drying mat. This rinse basket arrived in a box with no instructions to say what material it was made of, the measurements of the basket, or where to return for a replacement should the rack fail. The Amazon page says it's a stainless finish and has a 1-year warranty. The measurements on the Amazon page say it fits a bowl size that is 14 x 16 with center drain. I would say that is correct since the rack measures 15 inches wide from front to back (long wise), 12 inches wide from side to side (width wise) at the widest point, and 6-1\/2 inches high if I count the feet. The feet are rubberized so that it does not slip around in the sink. My sink is 8 inches deep, 21-1\/2 inches wide from left to right, and 17 inches wide from front to back (18-1\/2 wide if I count the notch on the left). I use this on the right side of my (single-bowl) sink and wash on the left side. I then store this in the top rack of my dishwasher within easy reach for when I want to use it again. I could leave it in the sink but I do not always wash so many dishes at once. However, if I had side-by-side sinks, I would leave this in the sink. The unit feels very sturdy, is really nice looking, and what I consider a 5-star product. The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the following: - Utensils fall through the rack as there is no utensil basket. I could use my dishwasher utensil basket but that would take up valuable space in this rack. - I consider the current price of $63.75 a bit steep for a rinse basket. However, if this lasts for life then it's cheap. Only time will tell if this lasts and does not rust; I will update my review if I encounter any problems. - The lack of an information sheet with the product description and warranty information is mildly disappointing. Other than this, I feel this basket is high quality and perfect as a rinse basket. It is even more useful for me because I also use it as a counter-top dish drainer.","label":0}

{"text":"I own a Linco Flora Fluorescent Light Bank. It's a wonderful light head but, if you want to use a softbox, the Linco Flora Hexogen Easy Softbox is the only one that fits it. Conversely, the Easy Softbox only fits the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank. CONSTRUCTION: The Hexogen is a modified umbrella sans central shaft. It appears well made with heavy duty nylon fabric, reflective interior, steel ribs, plastic nylon hub and a velcro secured white diffusion panel\/cloth. Compared to Neewer softboxes, it's heavy duty. Build is similar to LimoStudio softboxes, albeit twice as expensive. While the 35-inch hexagon shape makes nice catchlights, it's bulky and can't be rotated for a smaller profile like rectangular softboxes. SETUP is easier than a standard softbox with component ribs but more fiddly than a umbrella softbox or Brolly box with central shaft. Begin by manually spreading the ribs open. Secure by pulling the string through the center hole until a latch locks in place in. To collapse, press the latch. It's faster and less fiddly to simply push the hub with my palm until it locks. The pull string is its weakest element, albeit easy to replace if broken. Slow and gentle assembly is recommended and don't muscle or jerk that wee string. Installation on the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank is fussy compared to a shoot through umbrella or umbrella softbox: align ribs with indentations on the Light Bank, compress hub until you feel a slight give and tighten front and rear thumb wheels. If you don't maintain compression during lockdown, the thumbwheel shaft will not bite into the hub. Setting up the Easy Softbox is marginally faster than a normal softbox. Maybe a minute saved? Nevertheless, it works wonderfully with the Flora Light Bank: pleasingly even and soft light with attractive catchlights. It also looks professional and clients are impressed! MUSINGS: The Flora Light Bank and Hexogen Easy Softbox are available as a kit but are fifteen or twenty bucks cheaper whenpurchased ala carte. Oddly, neither the head or softbox ship with instructions or even a link to a PDF or video tutorial. Experienced studio shooters will figure out how to assemble and use these products in a couple minutes. After all, they're similar to other CFL heads and umbrella softboxes. However, a beginner will have a tough time setting it up. The included storage bag is a cruel joke. An inch more in width and length would have made it much easier to fit the folded softbox. I keep the Hexogen in an old Vanguard tripod bag. Finally, unlike some other reviewers, the item I received was emblazon with the Linco Flora logo on both softbox and bag. FINAL BURB: Improvements I'd like to see are a metal hub, stronger pull cord, larger storage bag and enclosed instructions. It's pricy compared to my LimoStudio softboxes but the Hexogen Easy Softbox is a solid product: integrates well with the Flora Light Bank, boasts quality materials and construction and renders pleasingly soft light.","label":0}
{"text":"Do you want Power more than anything else from your headlamp? At anywhere near this price, this is it. Let me tell you about this headlamp, and I purchased my first one just like this one six months ago, so I know about them. You're going to get a reasonably comfortable band, that can be improved on by wearing an athletic headband under it. I think that it will adjust to anybody's head on this third rock from the sun and it works well. On the back of it, is the power pack containing two, included 18650 batteries. I did a capacity test on them and they were measured at about 1200mAh, so the two will last quite a while, 3-5 hours or more on Low, but I'm using two 3100mAh in mine that test at over 3200mAh and now it really lasts. This pack includes a USB port to charge it or any other device that you charge USB, and this comes with a wall charger for the pack too, so it arrives ready to charge and use. The pack has a rubber cover to pull off to insert the batteries and it stays attached by a little ring, so you won't drop or misplace it. On the front is the lamp and it's got a magnifying lens. This lamp is what really rocks about this, it uses a good, white XM-L2 LED with a lot of output. I've never owned a more powerful headlamp and this will provide daylight at about 75 feet. It will also provide a huge, bright flood of light at 25 feet. You'll twist the ring on the light like a camera zoom, for magnification. This uses a 5 setting switch with memory and you will need to click this one to cycle through them. It's High-Medium-Low-Strobe-SOS, and if you're on Medium and shut it off, it will remember to turn back on Medium, unless you don't wait long enough, in which case it would then cycle to Low. This is very wide magnification that this lens is using, so it won't shine quite as far as my fixed lens flashlights like it, but this is still so much light that you will like this lamp, guaranteed. Everything about this is okay, except that I really wish that they would have made the tilt more adjustable, you'll get four positions with three usable. These batteries work fine but you'll like it even better with an upgrade to higher rated ones. You might not get more than half a phone charge from these batteries, unless they are fully charged, and of course they won't power the light as long either. I'm using , which cost more than the light does today, but it's 6400 vs 2400mAh and I could top off my phone twice and still have hours of light. 18650 batteries will recharge 500 times, so expensive batteries are cheap in the long run, it will depend on how often you charge them, but maybe only $2 a year. It's something to consider, mainly if you do want to charge a device from this or will use the headlamp where you can't charge it again for days. Now after owning two of these headlamps, I love them twice as much. There are a few nits to pick, but this kind of Power at this price, fagetta bout it.

I couldn't understand how an extended life battery could be sold for $26 when the standard life battery sold for around $90 from Dell. I understand now. The battery case never mated right to the laptop. We could mash it in there, and it would sort of stay, but then we would get the \"battery replacement\" warning from the laptop. My wife is using this laptop for school. When she lost some of her homework due to lack of a battery, I was truly in fear for my life. When she screamed \"this piece of crap battery!\" I knew I had only minutes to live. I immediately went to the Dell website and ordered the OEM battery. Yes, it was three times the price and only the \"standard\" battery, but it work. It slid in perfectly. No more battery replacement warnings. No more homework loss. No more fear for my very existence. While this was an exciting adventure, (after all, seeing ones true mortally forms a lasting impression), it was a truly worthless battery. Now you may think of this story as somewhat of an exaggeration, but my wife is a native Texan. All true Texans have guns. When there's an irritating varmit, out comes the shotgun...

{"text":"The Rock Says...: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment. By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson with Joe Layden. Published by HarperEntertainment. Released January 5, 2000. Pages 304, hard back. No introduction is necessary for Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, he is possibly the most recognised wrestler of all time, a successful movie star, one of the top merchandise sellers of all time inside the wrestling industry and one of the most charismatic superstars ever. Gaining world heavyweight championship gold a total of 9 times in a relatively short full time career of 8 years. The Rock is unquestionably a future inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame. But does The Rock Says... have the same credentials as the man telling his story? As you would expect there is a lot of humour through-out the retelling of The Rock's story. The first six chapters of the book cover his early life, football career and training for his future in Sports-Entertainment complete with amusing anecdotes mirrored by the mischief he got himself caught up in as a teenager. The following nine chapters are devoted to his in ring career, recounting his metamorphosis from Rocky Maivia into The Rock, taking you to the time so you can understand why the audience were the deciding factor in Dwayne going from a sparkling clean good guy to the third person speaking, cocky villain known as the 'People's Champion'. Rock recalls backstage shenanigans as he tells his story, most notably with Mick Foley, Rocky also covers key matches and points in his career telling the matches as if he is in the match, speaking in character, in third person. The Rock Says... follows the Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment all the way up until Wrestlemania 15 against his arch nemesis 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin. There is an additional emotional chapter added before it was published dedicated to remembering the life of Owen Hart who tragically died during the period of time the book was written in. The main flaw with this autobiography of The Rock is it was written too soon, at publication in 2000 it was at the height of his career, being only half way through his full time portion. Even though he tells the matches as if they were legitimate rather than as they actually are, he does discuss certain behind the scenes aspects, however do not expect a tell all, expose the business type read. Overall The Rock Says... is an entertaining read if you are a fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and want to know about his life before wrestling mixed with funny stories from his career up until Wrestlemania 15. 3\/5 Stars By Jimmy Wheeler","label":0}

Some threads cite pre-existing but mild anxiety that was heightened while taking tribulus. There is at least one report to the FDA implicating this supplement in a death from suicide.

In my childhood some of my relatives made rag rugs which were of beautiful quality and workmanship, and very durable. These rugs are tawdry.

{"text":"Hard to be more pleased with what I received, there really is not much to quibble about. It's true the accents are more purple than red, especially when viewed at night with indoor light. With sunlight illuminating them from the rear however, they do take on a more reddish hue. No problems on length or alignment of the panels -- something I was given to worrying about when reading experiences of others. Quality is just what I expected, they are thick enough to be durable and to sufficiently filter light to provide some privacy -- but a sheer curtain behind them or window blinds will really be needed for complete privacy. I hung mine highest to the ceiling in front of a bedroom window under which my bed sits for maximum effect -- this does mean that there is a difference of illumination in the daytime -- with the top half looking somewhat like a storm clearing in the late afternoon or early morning. The colors do wash out somewhat if you do not have blinds or a sheer curtain behind them in the daytime -- but with something additional to filter the light the effect is rather one of illumination -- very nice indeed. The type of indoor lighting you have at night will modify the hues somewhat, but I don't see this as a problem for anyone, that's just a natural thing with all colors. It's hard to see how anyone could be disappointed with the purchase, barring some manufacturing defect or quality control issue.","label":0}

{"text":"This book confirms that Elon Musk will go down as one of the greatest entrepreneurs in American history. The book is an incredible inspiration for anyone who has a business as it details the many times that he could have failed and didn't because of his incredible commitment, dedication and vision. He has many of the talents of Gates and Jobs but his wealth accumulation and his impact will likely exceed both. SpaceX earlier this week was just certified by the US Air Force to launch satellites for the Pentagon, wrestling the monopoly away from the United Launch Alliance, a joint space venture formed in 2006 by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Defense. This should allow SpaceX to capture a major portion of the $80 billion annual revenues from space launches. This is the first of many biographies about Musk that will be written just like was done for Steve Jobs who is really the only person that can be fairly compared to Musk. More than likely Musk's contributions to tech and humanity will far exceed Jobs as they nearly have now and he is 15 years younger than Jobs and will likely far out live him. The book is not an authorized autobiography but ultimately Musk agreed to allow the author dozens of personal hours of time with him in which he was able to reveal many details about his life. Some of the facts I found fascinating is that while everyone knows that he is from South Africa, I have read many articles about Elon but never saw any mention of his American ancestry which goes back many generations. His great grandfather and grandfather were actually American chiropractors both graduating from the Palmer school. His grandfather was quite the explorer and aviator and eventually moved his family to South Africa but wound up dying in an aviation accident. The book describes Musk as having a photographic memory and reading up to two books a day while he was a child. When he ran out of books he started reading the Encyclopedia Britannica. This is likely one of the characteristics that contributed to his success. But the downside of his brain is that he would frequently reflect on items and he had challenges making friends as a child. This was such an issue that his parents had his adenoids removed hoping that it would solve the problem. So while Elon was born in South Africa, America can rightly claim his as hers as most of his innovations were in the US and his ancestral lineage is here. It is also interesting that his mother was strikingly beautiful and was a finalist for Miss South Africa and continued to be a model into her sixties. Although the book is not an authorized by Elon, it offers many important early details into his life and will quite likely eventually emerge as one of the most important American entrepreneurs ever born. The writing is easy and even more enjoyable to read the Walter Isaacson's authorized Jobs biography. While I have yet to read the entire book and will update my review once I have, if you are a Tesla or Musk fan than I strongly recommend that you read this deeply inspirational book. BTW, I personally own two Tesla S sedans. I preordered my first one nearly two years before it was made and got one of the first 2000 made. I liked it so much I gave it to my girlfriend and I purchased the P85 two years later. I will purchase the P85D in the next year or so but will wait till they add more features. Not only has the Tesla rated much higher than any other car Consumer Report ever evaluated but it is the safest car or SUV ever tested. The P85D has an insane mode that will move the four door sedan from 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds, but because it has two electric motors and is an all wheel drive car it is faster 0-30 than any commercial car out there, including Ferrari, MclLaren, Lamborghini or Corvettes","label":0}

{"text":"Wonderfully efficient! The GLM is pricy compared to models with fewer features, but it is terrifically easy and useful for anyone working alone. Not only does it measure distances very accurately and quickly, one measure after another is stored, so you can take multiple measures, then go back to the notepad to record. It includes features to add multiple measures, calculate area and a few other things. The magic is the built-in inclinometer, allowing angle readout so you can hand hold it exactly level, or take measurements indirectly, like measuring to the top and bottom of a wall, then determining wall height (the calculations are built-in). Never again will I try to lay metal tape across a wide space, dodging obstacles like furniture. I give this my highest recommendation. If you're looking at the lower cost models, be sure to check the maximum accurate distance -- that was important to me or I could have saved a few dollars.","label":0}

{"text":"Robins and Wildsmith look at comic books and graphic novels they believe are appropriate from pre-school through 8th grade in this book. All but one of their recommendations includes both cover art and a full page of the comic for the reader to consider. If the series or graphic novel has won awards these are noted next before topics of an educational nature are listed along with a rare website that expands upon these often very basic life lessons. \"Heads Up\" lists some issues that might concern some parents like name calling or violence or potty humor for example. \"What's Next...\" suggests other comic books or graphic novels that touch upon the same themes or use the same genre. I was pleasantly surprised at the wide range of genres and the quality of artistry included in this guide. Indeed the range is so great that I was surprised that some of these comic books or graphic novels were appropriate for this age range. For example the \"My Boyfriend is a Monster\" series seem more for 9+ grade than 6-8 to me but perhaps we are pushing our girls to think about dating at earlier and earlier ages. Likewise \"Bone\" was a shocker to see in these pages since we've always considered this a high school or adult graphic novel around my house. Regardless Robins and Wildsmith give us enough information to make an informed decision before we buy any of these for our children or children we know. I can't say this is worth buying given how many new comic books and graphic novels can come out every year but you should definitely borrow it from the library and check it out before you pop into your local comic book shop and buy something for a child in your life.","label":0}

{"text":"I'm writting the review mostly because I saw several reviews talking about the size of this thing and hopefully I can help someone (when I first bought it the dimensions were not specified, I see now that the vendor has clarified it). This one has a 1 1\/2\" diameter, that is the thread diameter (the size of the hole on your DE filter, the one you take off to let the water inside the filter completely drain out and so you can wash any sand deposits at the bottom of your filter). The size of the cap is just over 2\", but that shouldn't matter to you, what you need to make sure is that the size of the hole is the same size as the thread on this thing. Mine is actually 2\" size, so this cap is actually too small. On the positive side though, the o-ring is very flexible so I couldn't use the cap, but I could still use the o-ring (though I would recomend you get the right 2\" o-ring because by stretching it that much I would guess it will last a lot less than the right O-ring). I've tried with a lot of teflon tape and you really do need the o-ring to stop all leaks.","label":0}

{"text":"I have to start off this review by stating THE INSIDE is a nice surprise. Because of its premise, I wanted it to be good. I buy movies from pawn shops on a frequent basis, and therefore I'm familiar with what many of them sell. As I've perused the stores, I've sometimes wondered if the owners ever find forgotten video tapes inside of video cameras or forgotten DVDs inside of DVD players. Director Eoin Macken uses this premise and sends the viewer on a nightmarish ride into hell. The result is a wicked and intense movie experience that is both haunting and satisfying. I do have to give a warning about this film, however: most of it is shot in first-person POV from a handheld camera. Because of this, there are many shaky and dizzying shots. People who became motion-sick from movies like CLOVERFIELD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will probably want to stay away from this film. THE INSIDE is well made overall, and looks great from a production standpoint. It is actually a hybrid movie, in that it combines found-footage with actual third-person POV shots. I like this aspect, as it allows you to immerse yourself in what is going on\u2026but it also lets you take a breather every once in a while when the intensity gets too amped up. And speaking of intense, this film does not let up. It takes a few minutes for the plot to unfold, but when it does, you'd better buckle your seatbelt. When things start to happen, they move at a shotgun blast pace. I particularly like how linear everything is; there are no flashbacks or pauses for reflection. When the proverbial crap hits the fan, the viewer is held spellbound until the credits start to roll. The acting in THE INSIDE is very good as well. I hate to admit I do not recognize any names in the cast list, but I will wager they will definitely do well in future endeavors. Likewise, the special effects are pretty good, too, although there are not many of them. If I were forced to find a flaw with THE INSIDE, I would have to say the lack of explanation for the supernatural aspects disappoints me a bit. It's nothing at all that detracts from the film for the most part, however I, personally, would have liked a little more 'meat' in this area. Still, THE INSIDE is hell of a thrill ride, and horror fans should give this one a look soon. I will be hosting a giveaway for a DVD copy of this film as well, so be sure and check that out after you finish reading this review. Otherwise, the film is available now in a variety of formats.","label":0}

{"text":"The idea of the boxy is great. For the most part it runs well. I can stream videos from my computer or internet to the boxee. Sometimes the system hangs when you are using it or it disconnects itself from the LAN. The main reason I bought this was to watch movies from a hard drive wired directly to the box and this works well but has a limit of 3 Tb. It took hours to find the right firmware to update the boxee and get it connected to the LAN. The video quality is really good. The remote control is a little awkward but works well. The box is small. People talk about it not fitting on a shelf. A DVD case is taller than the box. The HDMI cable it comes with is short. It should be close to your receiver. The weakest part of the boxee is the wireless connection and programming of the software.","label":0}

{"text":"This is a fairly entertaining retread of familiar territory, and I did find parts to be extremely moving (especially when dealing with loss). However, the book failed to impress me for a number of reasons: 1\/ A slew of cliched situations and plot devices (ancient prophecy, circle of power, unnamed evil afoot, etc. ) 2\/ The characters were entirely one dimensional, and it was apparent at first encounter who was good and who was evil. No shades of grey. 3\/ Each character's motivation was similarly obvious. Greed\/power for the evil, and duty\/honor for the good. 4\/ The major plot line was extremely weak, was resolved with minimal fuss, and ended with a just-as-weak cliffhanger. This is not epic GRRM, and neither is it even close to the more mass market efforts by Goodkind. What it is, is a lazy read with minimal fuss and excitement, that won't raise your pulse rate as you read it. I gave it 3 stars for writing style, 2 stars for content, and rounded up. Happy Reading!","label":0}

{"text":"I only golf 2-3 times a year, when I visit my father in Pinehurst. My Dad, though, plays almost daily, so I brought these 3 balls with me on my last visit, and we both gave them a try. For me, I couldn't see any difference between these Callaways and the Callaways my father regularly uses (hex black). I'm not very good no matter what ball I'm playing with! But my father felt that the hex chromes were tooo soft; they are supposed to have a 'soft feel' but these, he says, are more mushy. Bottom Line: A mediocre golfer's game is not improved with the hex chrome, a strong golfer may find them too soft. My father did point out that a golfer with more experience than I have (who is therefore more discerning), but who has a weaker swing than he does (maybe a woman golfer) might enjoy these balls.","label":0}

Menus are easy to navigate. Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding. 2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery. The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around. Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell). Secondly, it took from 2\/16 until 2\/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS. Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?) Would purchase this unit again but only if it not being shipped USPS.","label":0}

{"text":"There are a number of models in Ernie Ball's pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing. To be clear, I'm talking about the MVP 6162 \u2013 the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There's no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn't specify, based on performance it's a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models \u2013 best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups. I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn't using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will \u2013 I'm not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise\/interference here - just practical 'off'). The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume 'floor' \u2013 meaning if you don't want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal's full-heel position. Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you're at the level you want, can be a real convenience (and your sound person\/recording engineer will thank you \u2013 even if it's yourself). At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive: it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you've only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep \u2013 and you wished for either a 'tighter' or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options. In case you're wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an 'anti-volume' pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum. I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away). Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle \u2013 especially if I'm doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn't be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way. The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn't is a side-to-side tone pot function \u2013 granted it's cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it's there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn't detect much loss with the MVP \u2013 although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation. The MVP's 3\/16\" brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice 'tooth' to it that's comfortable to use wearing shoes or not. The min\/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios. I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it's hinged otherwise it would just scream 'lose me!'. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn't come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels. If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal's internal components under the foot control \u2013 too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out. I can't comment on the tuner jack function (I'm old school tuning fork and ears). Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals. And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated. I'll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on.","label":0}

{"text":"The Lefun Wireless IP 720P HD Wifi Camera is an easy user friendly monitoring camera that anyone can learn to use. That fact alone is my favorite feature about this camera. Granted there are tons of great features to talk about and we will get into that through this review; but I want to point out that this camera can be used for the home or business and is simple to setup. Some ideas or ways you can use this camera is as a security camera, baby monitor, intercom system, and workshop monitor. As I have mentioned this camera is easy to setup and the box includes everything you need to get going. First plug in the Ethernet and power cables, then get your phone or tablet ready. The box has three qr codes that are for the iOS and Android apps along with the camera id and password. Once you download the app all you have left to do is create an account and add the camera. To add the camera select settings option on the top right side of the app, scroll down, and press \"Add device.\" Then press the qr code button, scan the small qr code on the box or bottom of the camera, type in the password, and follow any other prompts it pops up. That's all there is too it to set it up initially. The rest of the settings are preferences such as resolution, activating alarms, and other settings such as sensitivity. Once you get all your preferences selected it's time to mess around and discover everything the camera can do. Some of the features I like the most is the rotating head that you can control from your app and the alerts. The only problem I had with the camera was not actually the camera's fault. I was not able to setup the camera using WiFi and that's because my Apple router does not have a WPS button to sync between the camera and router. However, I am able to connect the camera to my WiFi if I unplug the Ethernet cable and leave it connected to the power source. I would love to have the camera apart from my router, but until I get something else I will have to use it while tethered to the router. Other than the non-wireless setup I would like to have, there are no complaints from me at all. This is a quality IP camera that anyone can use.","label":0}

{"text":"As a common audience, general appeal movie, \"How Do You Know\" comes up short. It really isn't designed for the passive viewing audience. For those struggling with relationship uncertainties and professional choices that require you to step outside your comfort zone, it does a little better. I believe that's where the appeal rests with this movie. My wife and I enjoy it because we've been through all the issues the characters face, but it is fun to watch the two main characters in the movie struggle with their own challenges. The ending (I won't give it away) may fall flat for many, but I believe it is structured to cause you to talk about the movie after it ends about all the possible outcomes. We've done so and always seem to come up with another future scenario. The quality transfer of the movie to Blu-ray is really no better than a good quality DVD transfer. It is a 1.85:1 widescreen (non-letterbox) format. Given the miminal difference in price between the Blu-ray and the DVD, get the Blu-ray. If it ever becomes more than a couple bucks though, buy the DVD because you won't be sacrificing anything in the image transfer or sound department.","label":0}
{"text":"I really liked this movie but I do understand why some people did not like it. The first 20 minutes of the movie was unnecessary but that is just my opinion. Also, the griffons scene made it look like they could've just used that the whole time. Another thing that people might not have liked this is the fact that it only built up for the following movies. My suggestion for people who have not watched is to either watch it now and wait for the next movies or watch it when the next movie comes out. But for me, I suggest you guys just watch it especially if you are a LOTR fan.","label":1}

{"text":"I'm a grandparent and I needed to protect some cabinets from my visiting granddaughter, but I hate those hook type catches because you have to deal with them forever or until you remove them. These magnetic hooks have an ON\/OFF feature that makes them perfect for the occasional visits. Installation is made relatively easy by the template with double sided sticky tape that allows you to properly locate the latch and the catch. My only complaint is the stick tape isn't sticky enough and the template has a tendency to come off too easily.","label":0}

{"text":"I keep this by my bed. The low setting is good for moving around a dark room at night. The fact that it remembers your last setting was a must for me as I didn't want it to come on bright in the middle of the night. Of all the lights I have, I find Olight to have the best interface. Clicking through multiple times at a fast rate to get to hidden settings just doesn't work as well as this. Normal operation is easy, the rotation of the head to change modes is smooth and feels solid, not cheap. Good clip, well machined flashlight. Converted me to an Olight user.","label":0}

{"text":"The balloon was not the same as the one in the picture. Outlines on Hello Kitty were gold instead of black. It was an obvious bootleg. The size was smaller than stated as well. It doesn't come inflated, for obvious reasons, so you have to get it inflated; however, they had the genuine Hello Kitty balloons at the market that were the same \"smaller\" size I received. So... all in all it was a waste of time and money because general stores try not to fill non-store bought balloons. A big hassle, although, the balloon costs less than a dollar.","label":0}
{"text":"We really like this mattress. We have it temporarily on the Sleep Master Platform Metal Bed Frame until our wooden bed arrives. This is a very good combination and would be ok long term. The mattress was ready to use in 30 minutes after unpackaging even though the instructions said to allow 24 to 48 hours. It's amazing how much the mattress can be compressed for shipping. It is easy to move with a hand truck before opening the box. Just have enough space for it to expand after opening. We would have put it on the bed frame for opening but the frame didn't arrive until the next day.","label":0}

{"text":"I purchased three of these as Christmas gifts for some dogs. My senior pitbull and greyhound were not even remotely interested, but my dad's vizsla puppy was OBSESSED. She seriously loves this thing and it's the only thing that can keep her focused for more than three minutes. She is able to get the treat out, but that keeps her happy too because it's pretty large and hard. As with any treat you give your dog, you should not leave them with it unattended as they could choke. In the end we gave ours to a friend with some younger pitbulls who also loved this toy\/treat. I would say its best for younger, high-energy dogs who still do a lot of playing. Our dogs may have just been too old to care about a treat that they had to work for. They like their treats handed to them with very little work done on their end. I don't blame them. I don't plan on working hard for my food when I'm old either.","label":0}

{"text":"I care for several little ones every day, so my earrings need to be on the small size, up and out of the way of reaching tiny hands. These Flower Stud earrings fit the bill perfectly. The earrings are flowers with 5 very shiny sterling silver petals. There are 7 round Cubic Zirconia stones in the center of each earring, for a total of 14 stones, filled out with sterling silver spacers, The earrings are secured with classic friction-back posts. Caring for these earrings is very simple. Clean with warm-to-hot water and a soft brush with a mild soap, then immediately dry with a clean cloth after rinsing. As always, with cubic zirconia, you will want to avoid contact with perfume, body lotion, and hairspray. It really does dull the stones. The earrings arrived in a beautiful little gift box. The sparkle when was opened was very happy making! These earrings will make a wonderful Christmas gift!","label":0}

{"text":"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is (still, like all others) not maintenance-free -- the springs still require lubrication. I got one for my son a year ago and he uses it regularly. He reports it has gotten really noisy. I can report, from many years of experience with a Needak rebounder, that oil helps. But, over time, very slowly and unnoticed, microdrops of oil built into stains on the carpet. We are going to try small amounts of white (lithium) grease, instead (think Pep Boys). Eventual spring breakage and replacement is unavoidable. And, stubborn as I am, I ignore their advice and replace them only as they break; not all at the same time. I bought a Cellerciser for myself at my son's urging due to the gentleness of the rebound itself. It is far gentler, which is important if disc verterbra impact is important to you. In summary, it is the best I have experienced and would recommment it highty. Tri-fold and rolling carry case are great. My personal opinion only: I think the \"maintenance problem\" with the bungee type rebounder will be worse due to the expense of the bungees and frequency of replacement. If silence is primary, bungee is the choice.","label":0}
{"text":"I plugged this into my 2007 Honda Ridgeline and found it did not want to fully mate. I was expecting this thing to fully mate with car; it does not. Yes, it stays in place and does work but a small wiggle will cause it to stop working. For something that is used VERY little, and its ability to quickly move between cars, its well worth it. Also, I discovered you cannot get features out of this that Honda restricts. One example is MPG. Honda blocks that data thus will not be displayed. This seems specific to Ridgeline, but is likely true to any other make\/model that manufacture does not want these settings known. Ridgeline was blocked because the MPG is so low (< 17) they don't want easy to find. Just my opinion.","label":0}

{"text":"If your good USA-made tools have wondered off over the years due to children, family, friends etc like mine, this set may fill a partial void. It has for me. If you haven't already looked at this you should: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000FLUB76?tag=i60-20 Something to beware of: Tool manufacturers to include those of flashlights are stamping items \"\"U.S.A.\"\" vs \"\"Made in U.S.A.\"\" due to some or most of a widget's parts\/build process being performed offshore then in some fashion assembled in USA. About the set: Heavy steel; lengths: 12\"\" OAL w\/a ~2.1\"\" jaw drop, 9.5\"\"OAL w\/a ~ 1.2\"\" jaw drop, and 6.75\"\"OAL w\/a ~ 0.75\"\" jaw drop while closed; very good thick rubber-type handle coverings which actually feel thicker than my 40-y\/o set (could be due to wear); exposed metal has some sort of heavy lacquer finish for corrosion prevention, something I don't recall on old set; water pump pivot pin is a big rivet vs lag bolt w\/ self-locking nut...Hmmm, I personally like those w\/ self-locking nut (older ones same size have) but perhaps the larger size pumps made today have lags\/SL nuts, not sure. The 'apex' screwdriver is stamped \"\"CHANNELLOCK\"\" which means something in itself; has a 'corn cob' handle -- it's beefy by comparison and should perform well esp with longer high-carbon cross-tip bits. If you're a picky B when it comes to hand tools, I think you'll like this set. Update: Something's odd with screwdriver (shaft pulls from handle - I finally figure out lol). It has a reversible 5\/16 inch bit (Phillips\/flat) which has a receiver ball to remain attached. And, apparently a bit with same type receiver ball (1\/4inch bit) must be used on opposing side (ordinary bits fall right out lol)...hmmm","label":1}

{"text":"I purchased the DVD based off of all the instagram photos and celebrity transformations I have saw. Overall I like the DVD. The workouts are simple enough to do. You will sweat. A tip I recommend is to always put more into each set that you do for better\/quicker results. I love how the mother engages you by being active through EVERY single workout. She pushes you to finish. As far as the daughter's workouts, very \"squaty.\" That's pretty much all she does, besides give instructions on what you should be doing instead of demonstrating. I love all the leg workouts she does in her segment, and I really love all the Ab workouts. I really don't watch her anymore, but I use the other lady in the back, Christy. She does everything. As she pushes, I push. Complaints: The low audio quality. The sound is drowned out by the background and my the music. You have to turn up the DVD to a higher than normal level to hear what is being said. Also there is some issue with the transitions into forms with Lana's portion. In case you are wondering, you DO NOT have to follow the meal plan associated with the DVD. I used my own regular foods, at a lower rate than I would normally do. I just eat smaller portions, and eat more (wise food choices) frequently. I can tell a huge difference in just one week of working out. You have to have SOME sort of diet or discipline. Just because you workout, does not mean you will lose weight, you must also watch you intake. Good luck ladies. You can follow me on IG if you like @XIjaneiX","label":1}

{"text":"Firstly the shipping service is so fast,great! The laser measure works very effectively. I used it with my designer, as we were having structural work done to my new house. He gald to told me that it can be put into his pocket smoothly. The measuring distance is about 196.85ft, the usage is quite intuitive for basic measurement, and learning to use it for a more complex calculation is not that hard at all. It make measuring a lot easier, easy to use and it very accurate. If you're in decoration profession, like DIY or general contractor I would recommend this rangefinder.","label":1}

{"text":"I am a fan of this company. The Tuft & Needle mattress changed my life! I'd forgotten what it felt like to get a decent night's sleep until I spent the first night on my Queen 10 mattress. I've been sleeping on it for 20 nights and I am so pleased to finally have a comfortable bed - one that fully supports me and doesn't impact me at the pressure points. Before this mattress I was waking up stiff and sore and feeling like a 95 year old woman rather than my 63 years. Plus, I immediately stopped having the chronic nocturnal leg and feet cramps that were making me feel desperate for the lack of sleep they created. I still get a few, probably due to the stress in my life, but nothing like it was was. I didn't order from Amazon even though I am a huge Amazon fan and found all the reviews extremely helpful because I wanted to check out this company directly. The whole experience with Tuft & Needle has been great. The ordering was seamless and my mattress arrived 5 days after I ordered it online. I have had numerous email exchanges with the staff at Tuft & Needle that have all been heartfelt and gratifying. It was obvious that if I ultimately didn't like the mattress it would be no issue at all to return it - an experience you can't get from a regular mattress store. Friends of mine immediately bought one based on my excitement and experience, and they too are loving the mattress. I am very sensitive to odors and found the smell of this mattress to be very mild and quite tolerable the first night and it has since dissipated. It is a firm mattress and yet it still feels wonderful because it supports while managing the pressure points. I applaud Tuft & Needle for the company they created and their commitment to selling an excellent product at a very fair price, while totally appreciating their customers! Thank you for improving my life!","label":0}

{"text":"Overall I really like this choice especially at this price point. We mounted a 42\" flat panel LCD. The stand is sturdy, and the TV mount pivots very smoothly. The wood legs are real wood (as far as I can tell) and the trim backboard is strong. The finish on the computer looks like a dark oak or walnut. Make no mistakes this is cherry to black cherry finish. It's much darker than the photo. The plastic (metal-looking) trim pieces look a tad tacky, but this is a really low price point for such a sturdy stand. We had to order the middle shelf bracket again as this plasticy-metal trim was glued on 1\/4 inch too far left which made the plastic roll under and jut out at the leg. Whalen said the part was in stock and said we'd have it in 7 to 10 days. That was 6 days ago...we'll see. The metal is strong, but be careful not to over tighten the bolts too much as the metal will give. All the materials were clearly labeled and separated. The best I've seen in any case-goods product.. None of the parts were scratched or dented...one metal bracket was a little bend, but I reshaped it easily. The glass is blackened (painted?) on one side, but it looks just fine from the top. If you plan to put any electronic equipment, speakers, or game controller chargers, etc. on the top shelf the cord management is a bit out of the way. Great value!","label":0}
{"text":"When you need to staple a lot of pages together, a manual stapler just doesn't normally do a very good job. If you need to staple up to forty-five pages together often, or if you simply have a process that requires rapid and repetitive stapling, then you would benefit from a product like the Swingline Electric Stapler, Speed Pro 45 Sheets, Black (S7042141). This stapler has suction cups on the bottom that keep it steady while you work with it, but still remove easily from the surface when you wish to move the unit. An easy-to-access push button on the back of the stapler ejects the staple tray, where you simply set a new stick of staples in it, then push it back in place. This is easier to load than my manual stapler at work. Once you have the stapler loaded and plugged in, you are ready to go. Just slide the pages into the stapling platform and the stapler does the rest of the work. The device comes with two boxes of staples. The first is a box of 1000 standard Swingline staples that work for smaller staple jobs. The second box contains 500 high capacity staples that can handle 25-45 sheets. The links below are to purchase larger quantities of the staples that came with this device. Any standard staple would work, but you will want tto buy the high capacity staples if you have larger documents to staple. I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone who has a need for an electric stapler.","label":0}

{"text":"Can't say enough about how much I love this piece. I only have a couple of concerns. The top is very \"soft\" and after a small amount of use, I can see indentions in the wood. Also, you can see the finger joints in the top. It is not offered in any other color top, so I painted mine, but due to the softness of the wood, I am going to replace the top or have it covered with a stone top. I can't say enough about the quick assembly process. It took us less than an hour to assemble, as a lot of the product comes pre-assembled. The height of the shelves on the end are not adjustable, so you can only fit small items in these shelves. The inside of the unit is very roomy and the shelves are height adjustable.","label":0}

{"text":"It is not clear what this book is intended to accomplish. It is a compilation of mathematical knowledge aimlessly stacked in an oversized book. The book is entitled Geometry but it covers most aspects of mathematics. The Elements and the Structure of geometry are not Set Theory. Of course a geometric object could be interpreted by the set theory, but geometry is not set theory nor is set theory geometry. This is as good as saying physics is mathematics. Interpreting a line as an infinite set of points denies the very essence of what is a line. Geometric object are visualization of physical things and it has rooms in our mind, infinity is a pure abstract philosophy of mathematics and has no room in our imagination. I do not recommend the book for learning a curriculum. It would be a good reference on the bookshelves.","label":1}

When you use the extension tube and have put in three 26650 batteries, it feels like you are holding a baton in your hand, which gives you a sense of safety. Second, it is very bright. I live in the countryside. This flashlight can light up things within one hundred meters. Even the leaves on the trees can be clearly seen. That is really amazing. Third, I was worried about the quality of the batteries at first, but after using it on a daily basis, I found that its own 26650 batteries last for over two hours in highlight mode. This saves me a lot of bother, for example, always having to charge or take another set of batteries.

{"text":"This lid is awesome and it also fits the Klean Kanteen mugs. I'm sorry Hydro Flask, I can't support your logo, but I will always buy your flip-top lids b\/c they are truly leak proof. Also the gasket comes off if you want it to, so you can periodically soak it in vinegar or whatever to make sure it stays un-moldy. Edit: I am surprised to read another reviewer describing their experience with the lid breaking quickly. This is b\/c I put smoothies in my thermos and forget to clean the remainder out right away and the pressure builds as it ferments and I can't screw the cap off. So then I open the little flip-part and use it as my lever to apply pressure to as I'm screwing the lid open and I always think I'm going to snap it off but I never do. I've done it a million times. Of course I'm no muscular powerhouse. But I have to say that I've specifically been impressed by how resistant to breakage that flip top is, given that I am applying pressure directly to its weakest point, the hinge, as I twist. So take this embarrassing story about my tendency to ferment leftover smoothie as a testimony to the flip lid's strength. Unless you're one of those guys who accidentally snaps the handles off the washing machine and stuff like that. In that case, you are simply a danger to plastic and no lid is going to survive the terror of your reign. Why manufacturers are still designing leaking lids after someone figured out how to make a leak proof one is beyond me. Only 1\/100 mugs have leak-proof lids. How does that make any sense? You can't tell me that the leaky lids are significantly more ergonomic to drink from, or easier on the eyes. Are you guys just doing this to screw with us? Thank you Hydro Flask, for not being a part of this senseless conspiracy.","label":0}

{"text":"Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your iPod's screen and reduces the glare - in my case it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints. This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either. Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things: 1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod! 2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles. 3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again. Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!","label":0}

I think I'm finally ready to say that this stuff helps. A lot. It's not a cure-all, but nothing else has improved my skin on this scale. It's better than antibiotics for sure, and best of all there are no side effects. I weigh 135 lbs and take two tablets in the morning and one after work (around 5). I take them on an empty stomach, although I don't know if that matters. I also take vitamin a, zinc and a multi vitamin. I wash my face using the . I took the same vitamins and used the same wash before I started Loma Lux and did not see a major difference until going on LL. Loma Lux isn't cheap, but it's worth every penny.

I started using a homemade spray remedy to kill them, which worked for a short time, but anytime I left the truck, I returned to find the same army of ants marching on. I finally went to Lowe's and bought these bait stations and put them in the populated spots in my truck, and I sprayed the tires with Raid. The next morning, I got in my truck to go to work, and almost no live ants were there. I need to vacuum the dead ones out now, but at least the ants are gone. But I'd get it at Lowe's. They aren't even $5 there, while the $7 Amazon price is absolutely ridiculous.","label":0}

{"text":"The BELLA Programmable Slow Cooker lets you choose the temperature (High, Low, or Warm) and the time (from 30 minutes to 20 hours, in 30 minutes increments). However, it does not automatically switch to Warm when the High or Low time has expired. So you need to be home at the end of the cooking time. I have used this for one recipe so far, and the chicken was done just right. So I think the temperature must be about the same as other slow cookers. The controls are quite simple. The instructions in the booklet don't match the actual device (the book refers to a non-existent \"Time\" button), but you really don't need instructions. Just pick the temperature and pick the number of hours, and then it starts. I think this slow cooker is more attractive in real life than in the picture. It looks like a cheap, bright red in the picture. It is actually a rich deep red, not quite a brick red but leaning that way.","label":0}

{"text":"Revolving around four lost souls and set in two parallel worlds, Franklyn certainly isn't the Dark City\/superhero movie it was rather misleadingly sold as but a rather more ambitious variation on that old arthouse favourite, the apparent strangers who are gradually drawn to the same place and event that will impact differently on each of their lives. There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away. Eva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played. It'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next. The Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film.","label":0}

{"text":"This is my favorite copy & printing paper. I've found that it works well with this: http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00BB5DJU6\/  Georgia-Pacific was recommended to me years ago by a copier franchise owner. He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier\/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams\/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with \"\"Amazon Prime\"\" shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with \"\"Prime.\"\" Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come \"\"beat-up!\"\" Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future. Update: 4\/5\/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a \"\"beat-up\"\" box of paper delivered. Update: 8\/27\/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams\/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack. Update: 2\/18\/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum\u00ae 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price. Still, I keep coming back to this best of all bargains in copy paper.","label":1}

The next day after it was all set up I went to use it. It was smooth and felt just like any other elliptical I have used. I did notice a bit of resistance when I was on it for about 20 minutes. I just assumed, \"well it's new maybe it has to be used a couple more times.\" Definitely wrong. Went to use the very next day, (don't forget, two days after setting up, one time of use!) and was completely annoyed to notice that something had to be grinding on the belt inside because I could barely move the pedals forward to get going. So we take that apart and peek inside and sure enough the darn belt looked as though it was about to come right off and was ripping. We called customer service at weslo and they proceeded to tell us that item is \"really backordered \" and we probably should take back to store. Thankfully we kept reciept and box for item.

I feel this is much better for vocals as opposed to instruments, though I have much more experience with using it for vocals - so take this last sentence with a grain of salt. I haven't used the program that it comes with, Cakewalk Sonar, as I directly use the mic in programs such as Fruity Loops and Ableton where I have mixing plugins available - so I cannot vouch for how good the program is but I can say that it works great with the popular audio creation programs and it is VERY simple to set up - just plug it in and go to your settings of your workspace and active it. Overall, it's definitely worth it.

{"text":"In 1972 director Francis Ford Coppola made one of the greatest movies ever done THE GODFATHER. Using the clout he developed from that film he made another classic that didn't get near the intention. That movie has just arrived in blu-ray format. Its name is THE CONVERSATION. Gene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert with a reputation for being able to record anyone, anywhere. The film opens with Harry and his crew recording a conversation between a young couple in an open air park. Using various pieces of equipment from parabolic microphones to microphones hidden in bags they put together each to come up with a conclusive piece of work. But the movie isn't all about this conversation. It's more about Harry himself. As portrayed by Hackman, Harry Caul is a loner, a man without much in his life with the exception of his work. He does have a girlfriend (Teri Garr) that he provides for and sees on occasion. But there is this underlying nagging fear we witness in Caul that has him keeping people at arms length including the people who work for him. Harry Caul is a classic paranoid individual but one who knows how easy it is to gain access to the details in a person's private life. Knowing this means Harry realizes how vulnerable we all truly are and how susceptible each person is to being watched. As the pieces come together on the project Harry is working on he begins to wonder about what he's recording. Filters are used to fine tune each piece, to bring together a comprehensive conversation where no words are distorted or left out. In the past Harry has made a practice of not becoming involved, in not listening to the things he was recording. But as he puts this one together, he begins to worry that perhaps this couple is about to be killed by his employer. When he goes to give the tape to his employer he is first pushed aside by his aide played by a young Harrison Ford. Eventually he meets with the man portrayed by Robert Duval. Paid for his services Harry leaves but still feels concern about what will happen. Going to a trade show of security and surveillance experts, one of Harry's employees is there working on the side with another expert. Bernie Moran (Allan Garfield) is perhaps second only to Caul. But rather than downplay his expertise, he's capitalized on it becoming a major player and manufacturer of electronic surveillance equipment. Eventually Harry is talked into allowing Moran and friends up to the loft he uses where they work. Moran continues to push Harry trying to find out how he did a particular job back east that resulted in the deaths of several people. But the reclusive Harry holds back, acting rather shy with the group. When it's revealed that Moran placed a microphone on Harry in an ink pen, Harry explodes and orders everyone out. Still concerned with the conversation he recorded Harry checks into the hotel where the couple said they would meet. Taking the room next door, he overhears an argument and then witnesses through a frosted pane of glass someone being murdered. Plagued with these images it tears at him. When he tries to confront the man who hired him, Harry is turned away. To give away what happens during the final portion of the film would be akin to telling you who the mother was in PSYCHO. The film is a dive into the mind of a man who peers into the private lives of other and who attempts to not have a private life of his own for fear someone will do the same to him. This lone individual with a conscious is doing unconscionable things, but continues to do so to make a living. It is brilliantly made and perhaps one of Coppola's best films but overlooked by many. Hackman gives an outstanding performance. His role could have been played over the top with rages and flamboyance but instead Harry Caul has more depth in the slow moving actions and scenes that have him doing nothingmore than listening than many actors offer when chewing scenery all around them. His role here should have landed him an Oscar. While the movie was overlooked in many ways for years fans have had the chance to find it as it has been released in formats from VHS to DVD. Now that it's available on blu-ray it is one that should be added to the collection of any die hard movie fan. And if you're a fan of Coppola or Hackman you should be out there picking up a copy as soon as you finish reading this piece.","label":0}

{"text":"My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT. I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in. Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth. There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution. You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted. I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor. I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub. It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that. Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a \"tub toy\" primarily. It works well and delights children. I had no issues with the operation of it. Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order. EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries. I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out. We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to \"use them later\". I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird \"rest\" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well. So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick. We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to \"rest\" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money.","label":0}

{"text":"After a 17 day road trip dry run here are my observations: (note: bag purchased primarily for airplane travel as it meets current size requirements) This bag is lightweight, easy to handle and you can stuff a lot of things into it. It rolls well on hard surfaces and  slightly harder to roll on carpet, but still not a problem. I also bought the week end bag that you can slide over the handle and it also worked beautifully. It did not try to tip over even one time the entire time. This bag is constructed in such a way to allow you to really carry a lot of stuff, and even though I downsized two inches from my Patagonia MLC, this bag held much more. Note that due to its soft sides, if you don't place it on a hard surface when opened, it will somewhat collapse. So I avoided putting it on a luggage rack in the hotel. A small inconvenience. But there is always a dresser or desk to set it on. The only problem I had with the bag was that some of the stitching popped out on the cover flap. This seemed to be a stress point as it was 3\/4 down on the flap and by the zipper. I don't think I overstuffed the bag, I think putting the weekender on top places stress on the front of the bag. Rather than returning it and paying a lot of shipping costs, I took it to my miracle worker shoe repair guy and he handstitched it with strong nylon thread. $8 later it was good as new. Overall, this bag met all my needs. I look forward to taking it on an airplane. I suggest you invest in the weekender because between the two pieces you will not believe what you can pack and travel with ease.","label":0}

{"text":"Purchased almost a year ago, my wife and I have been very pleased with this trash can. Reading through some of the reviews, it seems some people have had issues with their sensor - I can only imagine the frustration, and I send them my sympathies...there's nothing worse than technology failing on you. I am happy to report however that our trash can has been working nicely. PROS - Attractive brushes finish - Automatic lid activation - Fills out trash bags very nicely - Bottom vents allow for easier bag removal - Button for keeping the lid open - Includes accessory to hold bag firmly at the top - Reasonably priced CONS - Power adapter sold separately - Eats through batteries with daily use - Deodorizer feature is almost worthless We were a little disappointed by the fact that the trash can burns through batteries quickly enough to make the power adapter a necessary purchase - luckily I had one that matched the voltage\/current required, dodging that bullet. Many have had to pay for it though, so it was worth mentioning. Following the advice of previous reviewers, we have kept the sensor clean to the point of obsession (a quick wipe every time we throw away a paper towel, and then some), however the sensor has worked nicely for us. It is particularly handy when your hands are full of potato peelings etc. The design of the trash can allows for bags to be filled to about 90% capacity, and with the \"vents\" at the bottom, bags are more easily removed than with other cans we have used. The plastic rim holder thing that comes with the trash can is very helpful, and does a great job at keeping the bag over the lip. As I mentioned, others seem to be having problems with their sensors, but I have to honestly report no issues on our end. Because of this, I can definitely recommend this trash can - it's nice not having to leave the trash can open while working in the kitchen, with the added bonus of less serious cleaning due to the fact that no one is touching the trash can with \"kitchen hands\". A great buy!","label":0}

{"text":"I read some reviews warning about lead contamination in Chinese Matcha. I read up on the issue. I found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with Chinese matcha. Research done in 2006 by Han and his associates at the Key Laboratory of the Ministry Of China called \"SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA\" reported that 32% of 1225 samples of Chinese tea exceeded the MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CONCENTRATION of LEAD!!! It is a real danger that we all should be aware of. Another study has shown that even organic green tea from China contains lead!!! Lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen, 1999). I understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!! Interestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is much better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was \"not measurable\" Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!! The way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. In 2013, ConsumerLab.com advised people NOT TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! It says in the CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS section that uVernal told a customer called Barbara Zaretsky that uVernal matcha is made in China. As lead contamination is a big problem in Chinese matcha, I believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the uVernal so that we can all read the results and get some PEACE OF MIND! Until then, I am NOT AT ALL HAPPY to drink this Chinese matcha. Once I see the laboratory report uploaded on Amazon, I'll write more about this product.","label":1}

I've hit this watch pretty hard multiple times so far and only have a few small and hard to notice scuff marks to show for it in the aluminum face. What is really amazing is the recharging and connectivity to the MoveScout site, which you can use to update and customize the watch as well as go over your past workouts and see where you need to up your workout to keep your heart rate up.

{"text":"I have been through 2 units that do not even accept a charge, right out of the box, so far. Yes, I know that the unit has to be powered on in order to charge. Charger works for one battery but not the other. One (1) of the first ones delivered is working good though. Using to power 12V LED accessory lights. The original 2 units delivered had a small led protruding through the plastic case and no \"USB\" charger port that is not a feature. 2nd one Battery lights up when charging but does not hold a charge. Caution: battery light is powered on when plugged in regardless of whether the power switch is on or off. The 1st replaced one was a different design that had the indicator light built into the power switch. Now the item is under review by Amazon and I'm being told that they are investigating. Maybe they have been stored too long or in a non-temp controlled warehouse in Vegas - where my batteries have shipped from.","label":0}

There are 8 cookies in each bag and they taste very good. Each cookie has 130 calories and 50 of them come from fat. They also contain 10 sugars. While the cookies are delicious and were crispy and sweet I was disappointed in one simple thing. Why does the photograph of the cookie on the front of the package have more macadamia nuts than four cookies in the bag? I rate this as a 5 star cookie that loses one star for false advertising. Make the photo look like the real cookie in the bag. We purchased ours at a local store for a lot less money. (42% of the price listed here)","label":0}

{"text":"Blaster has been my favorite Transformer for a few decades. I found his four minions at a local toys r us recently for ridiculous cheapness. Had to find Blaster now. Amazon U.S. absolutely best price + shipping to Canada. He is a very articulated and stable(standing balance) transformer. He can hold three of the five minions in disc mode in his chamber. Was pleasantly surprised by this bonus. Steeljaw was a disappointment though. He doesn't hold himself together well in disc mode. He also \"pops\" when inserted into Blaster. This makes it difficult to eject him. It's worth picking up the extra minions; Eject & Ramhorn and Rewind & Sunder. They all are good in disc mode and fit well with Blasters chamber feature. Car mode rolls well and still hold minions! Very cool toy. Maybe Rumble and the other Soundwave\/Soundblaster minions could be convinced to defect?","label":0}

{"text":"The only real tools one needs is one hands and goes together very nicely. Ok, maybe the allen wrench, for the last two. Still, I welcome the included tools. There's no spare parts, so don't loose any. It's definitely nicer to wheel around than my old pop up with 4 wheels. I think if I'd gotten a massive laundry bag for the old pop up, that might have made do, but this is still easier to work with. I definitely enjoy just popping the bag in with the laundry and knowing I'll have a clean bag to put the laundry in to take back. Pre sorting, instead of all in one, does save time. Seems like it and the bags will take some good years of abuse. I'm glad the bags have replacements. Even though you can cram a lot into one bag, it isn't too heavy to haul one bag by itself. One day I had to leave a wet load in a bag overnight and it didn't drip., because of some laundry problems and had to leave, instead of wait for dryer. That said the clothes while wet didn't come out of the washer dripping, so I'm sure if I poured a cup of water in the bottom, it'd probably drip through the canvas. Things smelled like detergent, instead of mildew, when I got to rewash the next day. This definitely takes up some space and unfortunately I don't know if it will make it to intended place in my closet, soon and doesn't look so nice hanging out in my bedroom. I think I've already bent the bottom wire a little, by setting the detergent\\softener on there and squeezing in a fourth hamper once, but I'm still glad it's there to support the bags and what not, compared to the competition. It seems 3 categories isn't quite right for me, but the latter two are fewer and further between, so I guess linens\\whites can share alternate and the whites can hang sit in one of those $1 meshes for now. Also, I might get an insert laundry bag, to separate my tops from delicates. I can probably use the existing metal hanger, to make sure it doesn't fall down. I guess the onlything I'm lacking is self cleaning wheels. I guess I need to develop some kind of hallway wheel cleaning regimen, the hallways\/elevator are nasty in other ways in addition to the odd puddle in the laundry room, before bringing back into the apt.","label":0}

{"text":"I have been an avid Amazon shopper for many years, but this is the first product I am writing a review for, because of how impressed I am with the shoe. First off, I have had fairly extensive knee problems for many years, and have had eleven surgeries, gone through hours of physical therapy for these and for ITB syndrome, etc. To some degree the fact that I continue to be a runner is maybe a bit hard-nosed and stubborn, but I love it too much to think about giving it up. I've tried various shoes (about 12 different pairs of runners in the past three years alone), various knee braces\/apparatus\/sleeves, and varied running environments from rubber track to road to trail. I've always been an Asics guy, but have also tried New Balance, Adidas, Brooks and Nike. I've always tried to find a shoe with extra cushion, thinking it would absorb impact rather than distributing it to my knees. This is my first Mizuno product, which I decided to try after my Uncle recommended the brand to me based on his love for the Wave Riders; I was a bit leary, having tried multiple shoe brands, and decided on these Wave Creations based on his, and other reviews. This shoe does NOT offer my heel that super cushiony feel yet gives me the support I need to run pain-free, even days after my runs. I've begun to think that, like my sleep number bed, which I inflate to a more firm setting when I have back pain, that perhaps my thinking with shoes has been wrong all along, and that the more firm shoe is actually offering me more support in a similar manner. If you're like me, and have been continually frustrated with knee\/ITB difficulties, consider this shoe; it may not be for everyone but it's done wonders for me. I have a high arch and am an under pronator; I am 5'11\" and at the time of this writing weigh an even 200 lbs. I recommend purchasing this shoe in a 1\/2 size larger than your regular sneaks, but then I recommend the same for any running shoe as it had been advised to me by a professional several years ago and I've always stuck with that.","label":0}

{"text":"I love this sequel. It is one of the few sequels that measures up to the first. Batman is still a very conflicted guy. Then Selena Kyle is a mild wimpy secretary who knows a little self-defense. After she gets pushed out of a window, saved by some cats she becomes changed and the secret part of her that was hidden away comes out to play. The Penguin is a slightly sympathetic but in general evil and sadistic. I love Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman. She is both a good guy and a bad guy and not very manipulative. I love because she is a complete b**ch, but in a good way. No one pushes her around and those that do she gets even with. Although she and Batman do start a relationship she can't deny who she truly is and she would rather be that than be with him. The Penguin gets his comeuppance. Selena gets even with Max who pushed her out of the window. Batman aka Bruce knows at the end that she is still roaming the streets and he can count her to be an ally as long as he doesn't get in her way!","label":0}

{"text":"Just so you know, Cuisinart said these will be back in stock May 1st and retail again for $39.99. I went to review and saw these on sale for absurd amounts ($200! Really?!?) and just don't want anyone to have regrets. They work okay but we barely use them. Only once or twice. Glad ours was a gift and not something we paid for out of our own pocket. Certainly not worth more than what you would spend for a dedicated, really good waffle maker. These make thin, square waffles and it takes some time to get the batter mix just right and the amount right where it doesn't run all over the darn thing. Most of the time I whip out my waffle maker instead of bothering because if you are just a teensy bit over, it makes a HUGE mess over the sides and in the drain pan. And if the eggs are too big or small or you add too much seltzer or not enough, it can make the batter too thick or too thin and not cook perfectly. Thinner seems better overall though and you'll have to keep checking but try not to over-check because it won't crisp just right. I just bite my tongue at the mess the husband makes when he tries to \"help\" and pour one while I'm getting kiddo started eating the first one (another reason I take my waffle maker out now! Bit tongue does not go well with waffles. Nor does a massive cleaning job!). Haven't tried a mix with it because generally I like to make our own. I would not trust this to evenly cook if you add blueberries and strawberries (let alone chocolate or nuts). The cooker cycles off and on and so parts around the fruit will be raw or other parts burned. And I only use it with white flour, not whole grains (which we more often use) because I don't think it would cook properly. Even though we're in a small condo and it's a hassle to get out, my big old flip waffle maker (another wedding gift) that has an indicator when the waffles are done has a better overall texture, fluffy insides, crispy outside, pure-pleasure type of finish and is worth taking the time to get out even on busy nights when we just want something quick for a different, fun dinner. I tend to prefer thin waffles too, but the waffle maker really does a better job over this even if they are a thick. Cleaning the plates on this in the dishwasher are easy. The rest of the griddler-thing when it spills over, not so much!","label":0}

{"text":"The stories in this collection shout \"youngster\" so I was not at all surprised to arrive at the Acknowledgments and find gracious thanks to teachers, editors and the McDowell Colony. The one hiccup was author Quatro's nod to a husband of 24 years. So, wrong about the youth. I'll start again, this collection feels like the work of a beginner. There is a focus here on sex and death that bespeaks adolescence. It recalled to mind , not for stylistic reasons, but because the focus of these stories is relentlessly those of a teen. Disease, arousal, death, smatterings of religiosity, more arousal, more death, more disease. Then too, there is the clear influence of an MFA program interlaced throughout. All of the stories feel too studied, too intentional, to be deeply interesting. With practice, Jamie Quatro could easily become a fine writer, after she breaks free from the university and the colonial artiness that presently entrap her muse.","label":0}

Working with anyone, the backdrop will get a little dirty from feet to scuffs from light stands. My only complaints would be that it doesn't have a rod pocket. That was easily fixed. I taped the backdrop to the roll it was shipped on. That way I can slide the roll on and off the backdrop stand. It also adds a little extra support because the vinyl is a lot heavier than muslin.","label":0}

You have to have a real nostalgia thing going to enjoy it them, or just like the feel of it over an open fire on a cold morning or evening. Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming, but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me. The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I don't get the coffee as hot as over a campfire. As to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling, I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit' near indestructible which is not true. Just because they are made of metal you can't toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather. I've always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them. No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast. All I can tell you is that the number I have owned have held up well for me and I have never had a problem with them. Altogether a rugged, well made old time mug at a good price that I highly recommend... : )","label":0}

I had tried LED, CFL bulbs which either buzzed or were too long and stuck out. Then I found these bulbs that fit perfectly and would dim a little, no buzzing and much brighter. Perfect for eating or reading with two of these in a dining room approx 12' x 10'. 5 stars","label":0}

{"text":"When I came across kinesiology tapes, I felt right away that they might just do the trick. I wanted to see if they would support my muscles & tendons and also what it would do for my ache & pain areas, especially my lower leg muscles. I stay very active, but as I am quickly moving into my middle age, my body does not recuperate as quickly as in my younger years. Fortunately for me and my clients, as an experienced personal health\/fitness trainer\/consultant (path2fit.com), I looked methodically into kinesiology or kinesio tapes to see if it actually worked or was just hype. And as anyone who knows me can tell you, I test something very carefully before recommending it. I compared Kinesiology TAPE + to a few other top brands that are on the market. My methodology was to put Kinesiology TAPE + on one calf (where I was experiencing over tightness and spasms after workouts) and a competing brand on the other. I then switched the competing brand to another brand after a few days. What I found is that Kinesiology TAPE + is as stretchy, super-sticky, water\/grease proof as it claims. I actually put it on right after one of my work outs when I was sweaty & oily, as most of us are after a good work out session. I was surprised that it not only stayed on but it even lasted at least a week through workouts and showers. Instantly, when applied, I did not even feel my injured areas. That allowed me to continue my exercise routine when I was sure I would have to rest or alter the routine drastically for a few days till I improved. When it naturally came off, which was a lot longer than I anticipated, it had helped to heal the sensitive area with no allergic reaction on my skin whatsoever. The other brands, even though they had a somewhat similar effect, did not feel as good or last as long as the Kinesiology TAPE +. And some left sticky, hard-to-remove glue trace after they came off. Kinesiology TAPE + did not. I do recommend to follow the instructions of cutting the edges in a slightly rounded shape so it will stay on longer. Another thing that I like about Kinesiology TAPE + is that we don't have to be medical professionals to be able to apply & use the Kinesiology TAPE +. Instructions come in YouTube videos that assist us in applying the Kinesiology TAPE + to the areas in our body that need extra TLC. The almost magical Kinesiology TAPE + has helped me not only keep my exercise routine going but has aided me in healing the inflamed & sore areas in my body including my lower leg muscles.","label":1}

{"text":"After weeks of browsing and going back and forth between other products, deciding which infrared space heater to get in this style, I ordered this one and finally received it yesterday. I liked the fact that it has the air purifier AND humidifier built in, I was excited to use it to help lower my gas heating bill. It seemed to have pretty good reviews and I hoped it would work the same for me. But it did not. It did not appear to be defective, it turned on and after a \"heat-up\" period it started blowing at \"full power\". I placed it in a 12x14 room (8 foot ceiling) where my main furnace thermostat is located. The temperature on the furnace thermostat was set at 64 degrees. I wanted to see how much the room temp could be raised with this new heater so the furnace would not kick on. I left the heater running for FIVE HOURS non-stop. The room temperature would not rise over the 64 degrees and the furnace still kicked on even with the heater running. Maybe this one is just a dud, who knows. I have an old small Lasko ceramic heater that outputs more heat than this thing... I have asked for a refund but because I bought from a third party seller (something I usually NEVER do) it will probably be a big hassle if they even agree to a refund and will probably end up costing me more to ship back than the item is worth :(","label":1}

{"text":"My cat, (and the ones around the neighborhood that come around for hand outs), have always like Temptations. This has been a favorite snack of all the cats I have had around here for just about as long as they have been making them. It's always been just a snack for them, given out as a few here and there. And I have always liked the large variety of flavors. Although these tumblers are made of pretty much the same ingredients as the regular Temptations, I don't like them as much, and neither I believe do the cats. Although the idea behind these are for cats to play with their food, I don't think most get it or care, and they would just rather eat them. Also, like a lot of other reviewers here have pointed out, these really are small balls, maybe twice the size of a BB...I don't think the cats recognize them really as balls to play with, or just don't bother too...Out of the three cats I tested them on, two ate them without playing, and one eyeballed them for a while but eventually ate them. Perhaps finding the small balls rather unusual... In conclusion, even if these were actually fun for your cat, I don't personally like the ball shape. I think all three of the cats I feed prefer the Temptations in their traditional shapes that are much easier for them to chew. The balls are made pretty small for the cats to find chewable, but its my opinion that most still don't like it...I rate these Temptations 4 stars for taste, with the one star off for the balls that I don't think are that good an idea... : )","label":0}

Unfortunately, the velcro on the bottom does not work with the low pile, smooth carpet in my van. The Stayhold pieces slide around, just like the tote does, rather than gripping into place.

{"text":"I was tempted to give only 4 stars but I can't do it. I love this model yacht. I think the price is right for such a significant sized model. It is as large as an oven door or fireplace opening to put it into perspective. The only gripe I have was the size was actually larger than what was displayed on Amazon when I bought it. But this has since been corrected. It is 37\" high WITH the stand...the stand adds 2\" to the height - and you definitely need the stand. I bought it for an indoor window I have in my home and it barely fits...but still awesome. Assembling the model is a little bit of work. If you are impatient or have really large fingers or hands, this may not be for you. If you like puzzles and want to make an evening out of putting this together, you should go for it. I would suggest pouring a glass of wine or hot tea and make it a date night with your loved one when putting this together! I used photos from the Amazon.com site on my iPad when assembling the boat. I will upload photos of my completed model to assist others in the future. The iPad app only shows the photos provided by the seller...but if you go to www.amazon.com with a browser, you can see more photos. The model comes with just a single sheet of paper as the instructions. The most important thing is to not allow the rigging lines to become tangled when removing it from the box! It is tempting to pull everything out before reading the assembling instructions but be careful when doing so. The lines have small hooks on them and it is easy to tangle things up. Overall it is a beautiful display with it's rich, navy colored body and huge sails. It will definitely be the center of attention in whichever room you choose to display.","label":0}

{"text":"Roku updated the Roku 2 and Roku 3. The new Roku 2 is basically the old Roku 3 - but they removed a couple of features. The new Roku 2 is IR only - no more wifi-direct remote so you need line of sight now and no headphone jack in the remote. The Roku 2 is also HDMI only - it WILL NOT work with a CRT TV. I have no idea if Amazon is going to start transparently selling the new Roku 2 if you buy from this page or if this will continue to be the product page for the \"older\" Roku 2. The older Roku 2 has a model number of 2720R you can find that one here http:\/\/fave.co\/1cgYIuK and apparently the new one is 4210R, obviously here: http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwGOVA It looks like the only \"current\" Roku that will work with a CRT TV is the Roku 1, which (as far as I can tell) is just slower than the \"new\" Roku 2 but still has composite video output. SETUP Easy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes. - Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice. - Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website. USE Overall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room! One potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND \"Movies\", \"TV\", etc. At first I thought that \"Movies\" might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The \"Movies\", \"TV\" and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level. It's not a big deal, but it was a littleunclear to me. + Interface is clean, bright, sharp (at least with my HDMI connection) and intuitive. + Remote range is much better than Wii + Everything feels pretty snappy. - Minor gripe: Rewind seems very small (7 seconds?) - Minor gripe: Backarrow button sometimes doesn't work and you need to use the home button. CHANNELS When you setup the Roku you are prompted to select from some 20+ channels. I found out that there are actually more than 1000 channels available! You can see them on [...] Just to give you an idea of how the channels work (i.e., free vs subscription vs pay-per-use) I categorized my initial channels below. One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one \"Roku channel\" that de-duplicates movies. The result would be something like TV.com which shows movies and which channels host each one. Subscription - Netflix ($8\/mo) - Amazon Instant Prime Video (included with $79\/yr Amazon Prime) - HuluPlus ($8\/mo) Pay-per-use - Blockbuster ($4\/movie, has trailers, 4784 videos) - Vudu ($4\/movie) Free - PopcornFlix (commercials) - PBS Kids - WSJ - Crackle (with commercials) - Disney (mostly trailers\/commercials, but some actual content) - Fox News (with commercials) Get this, it's worth it! http:\/\/fave.co\/1cgYQKA","label":1}
{"text":"Way better than any other brand especially the one by Rugby which is the worst of all!! This one is really easy and quick to use while contains the same daily value and lacks any unnecessary garbage ingredients! Unlike other reviewers, I really like the design of the dropper. What a cleaver way to manage drops!! You just need to understand how to use it. One tip I can tell you is this: while dropping, try to keep the bottle in a straight vertical position (South direction or 270 degree). Do not tilt it. Do not shake it. Just keep it in this position and patiently wait for the drop to gradually falls. Also, do not hold the baby's mouth until you actually see the drop \"about\" to come off. Practice a few times and you will catch the right timing as when to hold your baby's mouth so the baby won't get frustrated from holding her\/his mouth for longer time. A great product!! Good luck!","label":0}

{"text":"If you truly want a top notch custom PC, you need to start from the ground up with high quality parts. If you buy this motherboard, you're on your way to a super fast computer. This motherboard has a few really solid aspects, like: Bunch of USB ports - 6 USB 2.0 with 3X the power on the back, then 2 USB 3.0 on the back. There are even slots for USB 3.0 on the front of your computer! Ram, Ram, and more Ram - This Motherboard accepts upto 32GB of 2,000MHz Ram Graphics Cards galore - This motherboard is made for Graphics Cards, so don't expect any integrated graphics over here. You can technically hook up three cards to this board, but I only suggest two since the last slot is on X8 and will slow down the rest of your cards. Am3+ - Get ready for the future with AMD FX series processors! However, this motherboard does have a flaw or two: The last Graphics Card slot is only X8, which slows down the second graphics card and kind of making that slot useless. This motherboard also requires A TON of power just to turn it over. I tried using my Thermaltake TR2-500Watt just to start out with, and it wouldn't do anything to this motherboard. Get atleast 600Watts with this motherboard, and with some intense graphics cards, I'd get closer to 1,000 Watts if I were you. Overall, I'm so happy that I bought this motherboard. You really need to have a good foundation to have an awesome PC, and this board gives you that :)","label":0}

Best used with the (as seen in the picture) http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKRVJA The fastener included on the pad is enough to keep you safe from any possible worry of movement. You just need to make sure that you place the fastener on the top side of your bra instead of on the bottom (I tried both). You can't even feel them on after the first day of adjusting... but the only thing I will say as a con is that you should be weary of what bra you use with them. I am using an all cloth, no shape\/padding\/wire nursing bra and 5 - 10% of the time you can see the bunched sides of the circular pad under the shirt. I think if I had a bra with more shaping to it, the pads would never show through. I purchased 120 packs and still have yet to use half - and I'm in the third week post C-section delivery. I recommend these to anyone I know who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or looking for an answer for milk leaks. I have yet to experience a leak, or embarrassment, and I wear these every day and night. Also worth mentioning - they do stay in place. I haven't worried about these moving around at all.

I bought mine in October 2013, and it does remove HDCP protection (tested with a PS3) which is the main reason you might be taking a look at this item. It is quite small and \"portable\" (sans the power supply) so you would have no problem hiding it. The main issue with my unit (perhaps defective?) is that the sound will either crack or just be gone completely. I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card () or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture. Overall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).

{"text":"Becoming Jinn is a beautifully crafted, carefully written tale of 16-year-old Azra who has what we all think we want -- the power to grant wishes (and I say this as a completely biased husband of the author but I assure you, every word is true). Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA. When the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016! This is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale.","label":1}

I was very exited to install this grill so I went into my garage and........talk about a letdown. It is NOT an exact fit even though the product page on Amazon says it will fit my car. The problem is that the longest horizontal bar (they are not all the same length) is about 1\/8 inch wider than the hood scoop on each side. Fortunately, I have a bench grinder and after a few minutes worth of grinding, it now fits inside the hood scoop as it should have to begin with. I gave it 4 stars because I am very happy with the look but not with the fact that it required modification. P.S. My hood scoop is factory so I am puzzled as to the poor fitment. The areas that are ground are hidden inside the scoop so they cannot be seen but care should be taken so as not to damage the polished surfaces. All in all, the look is great","label":0}

The original only had pieces of plastic covering the holes, but our Expedition has similar lights and these are much nicer looking than the original equipment. We took a picture of the before and after (different cameras and different sun lights, so paint looks different), and I can tell you that these lights sparkle like a diamond in a ring.

Well worth the upgrade. This band is much more secure and has a classier look. It looks like a nice steel band you'd expect on a dressier watch, but it's still lightweight and matches the case of the luminox. Each link of the band is held in place with a small screw, which I prefer to the springloaded pins (those always seem to launch away from me never to be seen again). Takes more tools to disassemble than pins I guess, but that wasn't an issue for me. Some reviewers complained about the screws working themselves loose...I haven't had this issue, but I would imagine that if you were worried about it, you could put a drop of loctite on the screws before reassembling the band back together","label":1}
{"text":"Buying a travel system can be confusing. I went to Graco's website and still had a hard time telling why some cost more than others and I always find that it's something silly like adjustable height for the handle or something. I have this system to compare to. So what do you get? A car seat. A base for the car seat. A stroller. The stroller is going to have the most feature difference between all the travel systems. This stroller has one hand closing system. There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright. I can't open it one-handed though. The other Graco system I mentioned above had the handle in the base of the stroller that you pull and and it folds (almost lifting it). I like this one better. This system has locks for the front wheels if you don't want them to swivel (manual mentions grass). The storage area is bigger on this system. The base is different also. The old base I have has a bubble-level to get the seat in the car at the right angle. The problem with that is that there is so much leeway that it was useless. This system does away with the bubble and has a red line on the base that must be level with the ground. I would get a level and hold it against that red line. The car seat is good (and pretty much the same as other snugrides) and highly recommended from multiple sources. The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have.","label":0}

{"text":"I was waiting for this 2012 model TV since I saw it at CES expo, because this 80 inch is the largest 240hz 3d TV so far. I didn't expected this TV to release in March, 2012. Anyways I bought it from Amazon via Paul's TV for $4472+tax (Los angeles tax=8.75%). Cost me total of $4863.57 with free \"white glove\" fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday March 31st, and got it delivered on Monday April 2nd, barely just like next day delivery. Considering myself a smart shopper, I actually did some research for the price check. All other places were $1000 or more even at my favorite Frys electronics store, but I still went to Frys electronics to see this TV in action, but Frys personnel said it hasn't been put on display yet, as it's been barely 3 days since they recieved this model. Anyhow I told them at Amazon it's cheaper price, and they were just amazed! to see the price difference. The have to call their manager to match it up. Finally they were able to match it up but they came up with delivery fee of $75.00. I still wanted to go with it but somehow I just remembered that being a Chase freedom credit card customer, I get an additional 5% cash back on purchases made from Amazon.com for the first quarter of 2012. So I end up buying at amazon.com for bigger savings and free shipping with white glove delivery. Next day amazon bumped up the price for this TV. Lucky enough, I saved ridiculously $1000 just in overnight. I bet you they realized that they were selling the TV for a cheaper price than any other competitors. Let's get to the point of Cons and Pros of this TV discussing some key features and comparing with my other Samsung 55inch 8000 led series of 2010 model. Pros: It plays MKV format out of the box. Built in WiFi. Web browser. Dedicated button for Netflix on remote. Hulu plus,YouTube with HD feature, Vudu, etc. Active 3D not like other 3D TV manufacturers which use passive technology. It's 240hz and motion plus to 480Hz, with contrast Ratio of 1:10 million. DLNA certified. More speaker output power of an additional 15 Watts of Bass as compared to all other LED TV manufacturers. Cons: It won't connect to portable Hard drive via USB. It only connects to electric powered hard drive and flash memory sticks (as written in instruction manual). When watching over the air channels via HD antenna, it won't give you detailed description of the TV program you are watching except the name of the program. It won't give you any info of the TV episode program in advance, that what is going to come next unlike my Samsung TV does. When using DLNA networking, it won't play MKV files. It only plays MKV files via when using USB port but not with portable hard drive as I said above. Rest if you want to buy any HDMI cables, or wall mount brackets, then I suggest you to buy at [...].

{"text":"So, we've all heard of Go-Go Squeeze, it's a mass producer of fruit sauce pouches, that were meant to have the convenience of Go-Gurt and be long lasting like canned goods or dried foods. But they can be quite expensive, have additional ingredients, and also are not reusable. It is much cheaper, in the long run to buy apples, pears, other fruits or veggies, and yogurt and make smoothies, fruit sauces, or healthy juices right at home. While I wish these pouches came with an e-book of recipes and ideas and also instructions for beginners, these pouches are super easy to use and also easy to clean. My kids love these pouches. I make home made apple sauce, berry apple sauce, and pear sauces and they love that they are like the Go-Go Squeeze they so love, and I love that I know what goes in them and saved a bunch of money by using them. The see through front is super convenient as my kids and hubby can see what is in them and grab whatever variety of whatever I've made and drink it on the go. I like the convenience of being able to grab a pouch and go do what I need to do but still get either a healthy snack or meal substitute (smoothies etc) that leave me feeling refreshed and re-energized. These pouches are easy for me to open from the bottom and fill, yet stay closed tight even when my kids squeeze them stongly. the easy open pouch and see through feature also make them extremely easy to clean and tell if a spot has been missed or if there is still soap in the pouch after rinsing. I really love the screw tops because then my youngest can not just grab a pouch and open it up without help or make a mess as he's prone to doing and yet I can open it up and he can easily drink whatever is in the pouch, whether it be apple sauce or yogurt. These pouches are thick and durable, easy to use and clean, and a great way to save money and know exactly what my children (and my husband and I) are putting in their bellies. Overall a great product and I plan to buy more so I can stock up on home made snacks and freeze some as well for future use.","label":0}

This thing lasted 2 nights and two of the corners were blown out, the tie for the bottom of the door ripped and multiple of the support beams bent. TWO NIGHTS. My kid isn't crazy or anything, but he's a young kid, like all the kids who like Jake. I just think it is an awesome concept that is very cheaply made.","label":0}
{"text":"I've been using Kettlebells for ~ 15 years as part of my martial arts routine and know firsthand how useful these things can be for both men and women who want to strengthen and stabilize their core, burn fat, and build muscle. Sure, weights can do the same thing, but Kettlebells have certain advantages, not the least of which is that they're fun and easy to use. The kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, hence utilizes more muscles than traditional dumbbells, meaning that a kettlebell workout is more effective and yields better results in less time too. What I hadn't found until now was useful instruction for those who have played around with them but want something more. Lorna Kleidman clearly knows her stuff, she is a 3-time Kettlebell World Champion, author, and coach, and it shows in the instruction. Ignoring the tutorial (~ 20 min) which you'll only need a couple of times, the DVD has a ~40 minute exercise routine, and ~ 4 minute cool down covering intermediate Kettlebell exercises. This makes for a well-produced, easy to follow, useful workout. You will need two Kettlebells for this routine (Lorna suggests ~ 10-15lb and 20-25lb for woman and ~ 15-20lb and 30-35lb for men) and a mat or towel, all of which are easily available at most any sporting goods store or online.","label":0}

Easy to set up and navigate. Pros: 1) Excellent customer service 2) Room filling sound 3) Excellent bass 4) Attractive profile 5) Easy bluetooth Cons: 1) No treble adjustment 2) No memory for each listening mode 3) No HDMI inputs for uncompressed audio formats such as DTS HD or DD plus 4) No HDMI ARC for controlling volume with the televisions remote. Just another remote to use and have family members bitch. I was looking for something with great sound To replace my surround sound system which just takes up to much room. I got what I wanted with this sound bar and wireless sub. Paring the bar and sub was very fast and simple to do after that I just connected the bar to my tv and everything was ready to go. I don't miss my surround sound this bar is far better and much easier to use. Sound is clear and powerful rather it be from the tv or from my phone with the Bluetooth connection.

{"text":"I will be traveling to West Africa, Macbook Air, external hard drive, video camera, and digital camera in tow. I can't imagine leaving my things without locking them up first. I trust Pacsafe. This bag is plenty big to fit all of the above, with room to spare. It is fool-proof in terms of how to lock it up - there is only one locking mechanism to close the top of the bag, so it's never left too far open for a sneaky hand to reach in. Material is sturdy, easily wiped down if dirty. This was recommended by full-time travelers, and I find it a very affordable \"insurance plan\" for my valuables.

{"text":"This book's approach to teaching music is essentially on the mark. I believe it to be crucially important for students (young & old) to begin music making doing just that - playing as much as possible first without being encumbered too much by reading lots of notation. The CD recording is very good in that it starts students playing using a G tuning thereby allowing music making to be virtually immediate. However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1\/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)! Odd, especially considering that the G tuning IS at correct pitch. Publisher needs to correct this ASAP!","label":0}

{"text":"I do not read Showalter religiously but have picked up enough of her books over the years to be pretty familiar with her style and her evolving trends. For a while there, people were concerned that she had toned down the sex to the point that she was losing a big part of what constituted her stories. Well, friends, I don't know if this is the first book where the trend reverses, but the sex is here. I realize this is a bit like saying that you read Playboy for the articles - highly suspect - but I don't really care whether my romances have explicit sex in them or not. I generally skim or skip when the action gets too hot and heavy. (If I want erotica, I know where to find it.) I read Showalter because she manages somehow to go really super dark in her plots - hyper-violence! epic battles of good vs. evil! superbeings clashing over world-shattering stakes! - while still being really whimsical. Sometimes maybe a little on the verge of too much, maybe. The women in this book sounded to me like a Cosmo quorum. But it's still playful and breezy and good-spirited and leavens the darkness nicely. Fantasy-horror-rom-com. Sometimes I have a problem with Showalter's world building. She's been at it so long and has built such an amazing canon that I'm constantly stumbling over plots and people I don't remember or just don't know, and I've run into a book or two where I felt sidelined by subplots or set-up for a future book. That wasn't an issue at all in Burning Dawn. There were references to the broader mythos and, yes, some groundwork, but it never distracted from the main story or left me confused. Anyhoodle, if you pant over alpha men and flippant women with a heart of gold, if your stomach doesn't churn when people are disemboweled or beheaded in fiction (or if you can push past it), if you can handle a story that is simultaneously grim and bouncy, AND if you do not shy at some pretty explicit shenanigans between (and above and nowhere near) the sheets, this could be the book for you. Fun times. I recommend.","label":0}

My only issue with them is that while unlocked, and opening the door, the fins ride along the inside of the pocket door and make a squealing noise. When closing the door, they don't make any noise, and if the lock is disabled, of course they make no noise. For now they deserve a full rating. We'll see how long they last.","label":0}

{"text":"The price tag maybe high, but u get what you paid for. After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's. First of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere. I rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go. And again this is my personal opinion, which may or may not be the same for everyone. Well I can't thank the BOSE customer service enough.

{"text":"The Panasonic BDT-230 is my second Blu-Ray player. My first was a problematic LG BP530. I have been a longtime fan of Panasonic products. I have had good results with them and found them to be very reliable. The BDT-230 appears to be no exception. Out of the box, this product comes with: * The Blu Ray player, of course. * Remote control. * Two AA batteries for the remote. * AC power cord. Since this is a product that uses firmware, I would recommend that the fist thing you do upon setting it up is to check for software updates. So, power it up, connect it to your network, and let it check for updates. If there are any updates, you will get a 'New firmware is available' message. The steps to update firmware are: Press 'Home' on the remote. There is also a Home icon displayed on your TV screen. Press 'OK' to enter 'Setup' Select 'Player Settings\/System\/Firmware Update'. Respond OK to any prompts. The unit is just under 17\" wide, about 1 \u00bd\" tall, and just over 7\" deep. It weighs 3 pounds. The top right has, from left to right, the Open\/close button, Stop, Start, and the Power\/Standby buttons. The front panel has the disc tray, remote control sensor, a flip down panel which reveals a SD and USB port, and the main display. The rear panel has the AC cord port, HDMI port, Ethernet jack, and an optical (digital audio) port. I had no problem connecting the player to my wireless network, following the typical steps, providing my security passcode, etc. The player sits about 50 feet from my router. The player is compatible with Android, versions 4.2 or higher\/Mira certified. I do not have an Android phone. But a couple of my friends do, and I had them connect while at my house. They had no issues. I also had no problems with response for other DLNA devices, such as my Windows 7 laptop. Response was fast. I know a lot of people have complained in this aspect. As with any response problem involving a network, the network must always be considered. If you have an older (slower) or problematic network or broadband service, you will probably see issues on this device too. I am running FIOS at 50MBps down\/25MBps up, but was at 35\/35 when I installed the BDT-230. I have the standard FIOS Actiontec 'G' router, but I use an 802.11N router in front of it, so my thru-put between wireless devices is 'N' (for devices that \"handshake\" at that speed). Again, I also upgraded the Panasonic firmware right out of the box, so that probably addressed a couple of fixes. As far as general performance, the player yields a great picture off Blu Ray, just like pretty much any other Blu Ray player. I still have a lot of DVDs. I found these rendered very nicely from the player onto my 50\" Panasonic TV. I am familiar with Viera as my TV has it as well. I found navigating it and using it fine, and just as responsive as my TV. I use it for Amazon Prime and Netflix. I know some reviews complain about advertisements. There is an ad option on the player. It is off on mine, but can be turned on. I left it off, of course! I really like the player and overall I would order it again. There are two things I don't like about it. 1. The HDMI is the ONLY physical AV jack, so you cannot hook this up to any TV, etc. lacking an HDMI port. 2. It does not play DVD-Ram media. These do not play, even if finalized. I actually have some DVD RAM, including many family videos I transferred from VHS eons ago. Panasonic, who made DVD-Ram a staple of their product line, should not have products on which DVD-Ram cannot be played. These two things keep me from rating the player a '5', which it is in all other respects.","label":0}

I have one package of original Pampers Swaddlers that I bought from Sams Club and a few diapers left over from what the hospital gave me......the ones from Amazon are a lot cheaper...looking and feeling. They are about half as thick and do not seem like they will absorb as much. I have watched the price bounce from $.17-.22 at Sams Club. Do yourself a favor and buy the originals found in the store. For just pennys more each diaper....it will be worth it.","label":0}

This type of system is a must for any traveler, it made my life so much more organized on a recent trip that involved different stops and hotels.

I highly recommend these packing cubes, they are a necessity.","label":0}
{"text":"Manus Midlarsky has edited a book based upon a conference on the impact of inequality on democracy. There are 12 chapters in this book (plus an introduction). The chapters take differing looks at the linkage of inequality with democracy. Some are more qualitative, others more quantitative. There is even an effort to use quantitative techniques to analyze Athenian democracy! One of the more interesting chapters is an essay by Edward Muller, in which he statistically analyzes the relationship on inequality to democracy (chapter 5). In several tables reported in this chapter, he finds that greater inequality is associated with lower scores on a democracy index across countries. Another chapter (by Ember, Ember, and Russett) indicates that greater inequality goes with less voice from citizens. Other chapters take a more exotic approach. However, in the end, this is a fascinating, although somewhat idiosyncratic work, on an important subject.","label":0}

{"text":"C\u00e9leste is a young French woman living in a small village in France during World War II. German soldiers are living in the village and most of the French residents are not happy with the occupation. C\u00e9leste's brother is a member of the French resistance. C\u00e9leste wants to join the cause, however, her brother won't let her in an effort to keep her safe. However, when her brother is arrested, she feels that she has to join the resistance to help him escape. You would think this is enough stress for one character to endure. You'd be wrong. Not only is C\u00e9leste a member of the resistance, she's also a young woman in love. With a German officer. Yep, you read that right. While she's fighting against the Germans, she is also in a secret relationship with one. That's not all for the twists and turns, but I don't want to ruin the novel. I have to admit that I wasn't too familiar with this part of the war before reading this. I had heard that the German occupation of France was peaceful for the most part. This novel shows how devastating the occupation was to the individuals and families who had to endure it. I found myself cheering on C\u00e9leste and her compatriots. The plot kept me engaged and I found myself rushing through to the end to find out what would happen. Every time I thought poor C\u00e9leste wouldn't be able to handle any more, there was yet another hurdle for her to overcome. She didn't always make the right choice, but she was brave throughout. I admired her determination, overlooked her impetuosity (she's only 19 at the start of the story), and wanted her to succeed even though the odds were against her. You'll have to read for yourself to find out if she did. This story shows the true brutality of war, even on the \"peaceful\" fronts, and it highlights how brave people can be during such a horrific time in history.","label":0}

They group together substances that may have a synergistic effect at achieving a specified goal, give that group of substances a catchy name, and label the total amount of that particular blend of supplements without specifying the exact amount of each particular substance. i.e. \"proprietary energy and focus blend\" & \"muscle cell volumizing matrix\") Save yourself some money and be sure you're taking the recommended doses of all your supplements by acquiring them individually from a reliable company, and mixing them yourself!","label":0}

{"text":"I have been into endurance sports for 3 years already as a varsity runner at my school and 10Ks on my own. I already have some experiences with different brands of heart rate monitors. I have had some different ones and my teammates have used a few other brands too. So far I am very pleased with this HeartQ monitor. I was pleased to see that it has all of the functionality I need on my long runs - like the tracker and calorie counter. The last monitor I had didn't have the same functions. Right now I'm in my level 3 where I'm exercising to increase my stamina. And when it comes to the function itself, they work great. The timer and monitor alarm really help me to know whether I already reached the current activity level I desired. It is very easy to use and to adjust the settings depending on my workout. Also the design was pretty cool - very sleek and comfortable.","label":1}

{"text":"I had a the same design for my old phone. Had to shop around to find one with elastic in the band instead of the cheap, all neoprene ones. Neoprene doesn't have much stretch and either had to be tightened to tourniquet-tight or would pop loose. I'm not a big weightlifter and don't have big biceps. This still adjusts to fit me. It has three Velcro patches, so it can expand to fit a huge bicep. A smaller woman could trim one of the velcro sections off and it would still be secure, but you'd lose one of tbe reflective tabs. I used the previous case daily on my bike commute and it has held up flawlessly for over a year, so I expect the same thing here. Materials and construction seem the same, which is to say very good. The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is the fingerprint reader. It doesn't work through the screen cover. I was pretty sure it wouldn't and I could cut a hole for it...especially since the S5 is water resistant, but a cutout option would be perfect.","label":0}

{"text":"When I went back to work, when my daughter was 6 months old, I had to find an alternative to breast feeding. I did a lot of research before choosing this formula. We couldn't afford to buy Baby's Only and this was a good alternative at a reasonable price. I did take the prior reviews, about the ingredients, in to account before deciding to purchase. I understand the concerns about some of the ingredients, but everything we eat has been contaminated by chemicals these days. Therefore, I think you have to do your research, take any concerns in to consideration and then make the best decision for you and your baby.

It simply rejects Blu-rays of the last couple of years, even with the firmware update. It still plays DVDs and old Blu-rays (like Spider-man 3, which came with it I think) but not newer stuff. With Blu-ray players now much cheaper, with fast loading times (this is a dog), and offering streaming services, it's obviously time to junk this, but I'd really expected to be able to give it to my brother, who needs a player with component jacks because he has a pre-HDMI TV.","label":0}

{"text":"The HS-81 and the counterpart the HS-82MG are great servos for their size and weight class (there's a new 82HB in the works). These are Analog servos, the Digital versions have 4 digit names, so for example the digital version of the HS-82 servo is HS-5082 (there is no digital HS-81). The digital versions have higher resolution and are important to use in critical areas such as tail accuracy on a Helicopter. For most general purpose flying, analog servos work great. I use a lot of servos. Keeping a dozen planes and gliders in flyable states causes me to continually build, rebuild and evaluate my servos so I write with the experience of many years. The HS-81 is very popular for ailerons and flaps, when on a budget but honestly I've blown a few out and had better success switching to the HS-82MG servo, it's not much heavier and the metal gears keep the gears from getting ripped out.. One installation issue is that you'll have to watch the servo width depending on your wing thickness to make sure it fits in there. If your wings are too thin you'll need to move to the HS-65MG\/HB versions. This plastic geared servo weighs 16.6 grams and has 2.6kg of torque at 4.8v and 3.0kg of torque at 6.0v. In general the MG servos are stronger but have a bit more play than the HB or plastic gears do. Due to these subtle differences, I pick which to use in any given situation based on how the servos will be abused. For Glider Flaps where the gears are often stripped due to dragging on the ground during the landing, I use the MG servos. For the more sensitive Ailerons, I prefer the HB servos that maintain tighter gears and thus more accurate control. For the rudder usually use MG servos on planes with motors, HB on gliders. On planes with motors, especially 3D planes with large rudders the Prop Wash is significant and the MG servos hold up really well. I've also blown out plastic servos by bumping the large rudder via hangar rash (aka non-flying accidents). These servos come with a plus shaped control horn attached and then a double and single arm servo in the box. They also come with four small flanged mounting screws. I'm sure you've seen the lower cost copies out there. Let me explain why, even though they may be lower in price, it'll be more difficult to use those. 1 They have less reliable quality control. Sometimes whole batches of the off brand servos are bad and once you've got it in your plane they can be a real pain to change out. 2 These servos are more accurate, center better and are more precise in their movements. 3 Do you use and toss your gear or do you re-use it? If you re-use things you really want servos that you know you can get parts for . Hitec sells servo gears, screws, horns etc so you can change broken pieces out as necessary. 4 when you need a special longer horn or special piece you know you can get that for your Hitec servos. That is not the case for many of the after-market servos. I have tried the lower cost servos and over time, it has been proven to me time and time again to stick with the name brands to get the support and parts I need. Hitec is amazing for their support; I did have one servo act weird in a rudder for me (it would wag with strong prop wash in big 3D moves. I sent it in to Hitec with a note and they promptly sent me a new one, even though they could not duplicate the issue. 4 stars, this is a great servo for a fair price but use MG if you have any worry over the gears holding up at this size.","label":0}

{"text":"I had expected this thing to be bigger. More like a kitchen knife. The actual dimensions (w\/o sheath) are about 5-7\/8\" long, 1-1\/8\" wide and 1\/16\" thick. It was a little dissapointing at first however after some time and a weekend of camping ive come around. Its well suited for preparing food as well cutting p-cord and whittling mallow sticks. This is my first titanium knife and i am thoroughly impressed with the metals properties. It sharpens up nice and stays that way. Needless to say its light weight too. Supposedly its highly resitant to corrosion and staining but i cant verify that yet. Steep price aside, these knives are great to clip onto your backpack or fishing vest. Ive even carried it with my keys as a keychain for a while. NOTE: The sheath is not kydex. Its a thick rubber that locks to the knife with a snap in the crotch of the handle. Very secure.","label":0}

{"text":"I had previously written a bad review for this radio, citing weak antenna performance. My bad. I took the radio out walking with me and it works fine, and it picks up a lot of AM and FM stations. I guess the reception inside my house is bad for some reason, but out in the open this radio performs very well. Sound is a bit tinny, but that's to be expected for such a small radio and at such a low price. I'm glad I bought it. It does what I wanted it to do: allow me to pick up NPR and the local classical music station when I'm doing my daily walk. As a bonus, I can also pick up the CBS AM station (740, KCBS) in San Francisco, which is a great source of Bay Area traffic and weather information, updated every 10 minutes.","label":0}
{"text":"This silicone cutting board is very thick and durable, yet its design is elegant and very premium looking board. This premium cutting board is not an easy thing to find when it comes to premium built with its modern design. Most of it on the same kind out there are pretty ugly, and easily get stained and hairline scratches when used with force. But not this one. This silicone cutting board is as durable as I thought. Marks aren't visible even until now after using it for several months and it is still on its brand new looking condition. I have recommended this to some of my colleagues and neighbors and they are very happy with its heavy duty materials that really help this board to stay usable for years!","label":1}

{"text":"This steam system is great. There are so many different tips\/attachments, you can steam clean virtually any surface or object. I was extremely pleased with the results on everything I cleaned with it. I have used it for -floors -shower walls (great for removing hard water buildup up on glass shower doors!) -crevices and corners around the house where dust just accumulates and there's pretty much no way to easily clean it (until I got this steamer) -detailing\/designs in wood trims where dust builds up - especially in the bathroom where hairspray on top of dust over and over again, has built up in the detailing of wood trim and cabinet doors and drawer fronts -got all the built up grease and grime off our propane grill and it looks brand new again now inside and out -vinyl siding with moss stains\/buildup as well as general dirt and debris from outside -patio furniture -grout lines -mildew stains on a bathroom ceiling -wallpaper - old (decades old) dingy looking wallpaper that has yellowed over the years - used this steamer with the mop head and the wallpaper looks clean and bright again and it makes the room look so much brighter ... the list goes on and on. Every time I cleaned something with this machine, I was on the search for something else to clean! I actually found it exciting to be able to get certain things cleaned up and looking new. The results were impressive each time I used it. I had previously used a steam mop on linoleum in my laundry area and I thought it did a pretty good job. The floors seemed clean, but there was some yellowish discoloration in the linoleum that always stayed there. When I used this McCulloch steamer on it, the discoloration mostly went away. The areas that still have the discoloration have faded out a bit and you can't see it as much. I really don't think there is anything you couldn't clean with this thing. There are so many attachmentsto be able to clean virtually anything. Even small tiny areas like buttons and crevices on your small appliances. The possibilities seem endless. All of the attachments can be stored in the tote bag that comes with the steamer. The extending handle makes moving the steamer around very easy. You don't have to carry it - just roll it. It seems pretty well made and solid. This is a great machine to have because you can clean everything with it. It is definitely worth the investment. It might seem like a hassle to drag it out and use it, but once you do use it, you probably won't have to use it on the same item again for a while .. like the detailing in wood trim for example .. once you do it, it will be while before the buildup is bad enough again to need to use this steamer. My patio furniture I am planning to do yearly and it sure beats buying new furniture or cushions every year. We were going to get new grill plates for the grill this summer, but now we don't even have to because this did such a great job on it. Everything you see in the video up there on this page is true - this machine cleans just like it shows and does an excellent job.","label":0}

{"text":"GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed. No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE. The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable. A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to \"bounce off of.\" This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare. The film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat. A more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten.","label":0}
{"text":"Im on a plane every two weeks flying all over the US for work and I never leave without this in my bag. This scale is very accurate and has saved me from a lot of worry and stress when getting ready to leave for my next destination. Some airports in the mainland have scales off to the side for people who want to check their luggage weight before checking in but when you have two large bags and have a tight schedule, there's no time to make a pit stop there. Especially when you can see the check in lines are long and the security lines are even longer. I highly HIGHLY recommend this product for those who travel frequently and are heavy packers. This has made my life so much more easier and efficient. I weigh my bags after packing and I'm ready to go.","label":0}

{"text":"When you enter the world of Ken Frazier and Sam Flagg, you never know what to expect. In this tale, J.T. Prescott has masterfully succeeded in dispelling misperceptions often held about those within the retirement generation. When retired seniors Ken, Craig and Bill invite the more youthful and physically capable Sam Flagg into their circle of trust, they band together and use their collective \"arts and crafts\" and set out on a dangerous mission to uncover a government conspiracy that involves killing an untold number of unsuspecting american people. The supporting characters are really developed and well written. You can certainly expect exciting action scenes with unexpected twists and turns along the journey. This is an entertaining and interesting read. Arts and Crafts has an underlying topic that left me with a feeling of hope and a renewed respect and admiration for a sometimes overlooked retirement aged population. I was reminded about the special knowledge and wisdom that can only be taught by those who have a lifetime of experiences to share. Looking forward to a sequel.........","label":1}

{"text":"This is a rechargeable and waterproof dog training collar. We have 3 dogs, 1 of whom requ'd an extra level of obedience training. This unit seemed to help out an awful lot. The package claims to work up to 330 yards remote control - we do not have that large a yard so I can not speak on the accuracy of this range. We found it worked well within our 50 yard boundary. It has 3 modes: static shock \/ vibration \/ beep. It was convenient to use and our dog could not wiggle out of it, as she tried a number of times. WE DID NOT TEST THE SHOCK FEATURE, only the vibration, and that provided enough stimulation to re-direct our dog's attention once she was not obeying commands. We did not test the shock only for fear of not knowing if there would be a malfunction. All in all, this is a quality product which does what it claims to do, and CAN assist you with training your dog if used properly.","label":1}

My kids can be pretty hard on furniture, so I intentionally buy things that are less expensive so I won't be devastated when they get damaged, and this fits the bill nicely. The instructions are excellent - very easy to follow, and the hardware is packaged nicely so you don't lose any necessary pieces. My only complaint is that when it came to the very end of the assembly, the corner back rest does not have pre-drilled holes to screw into the other back pieces. You will definitely want to pre drill the holes, or you risk splitting the wood. It took about 4 hours to assemble the whole set (with some distractions). All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.","label":0}
{"text":"Reasons for returning: Aux-in was very flaky Volume did not work after upgrading to Android 4.4 Unable to simultaneously use this speaker and my BT keyboard. All these problems went away when I returned the SoundShooter and got the Creative D100 (highly recommended). On the positive side: if you are looking for the perfect aesthetic fusion of manliness and adorability in a compact package that looks like it could blow up an SUV, this is as good as it gets. With EQ adjustments, base was surprisingly well represented at low volume, but quickly distorted as volume was increased. The caribeaner was useful for clipping the speaker to my belt loop while working in the garden. While not as cool looking, I suspect the HMDX Jam sounded better. If you can go bigger for the same price, I highly recommend the Creative D100.","label":0}

It was easy to slip the pack into the area that I wanted to place it in and then we played doggie for a big and then went outside, using the cap as his hat.

{"text":"Sara Shepard does it again. Seriously, I'm in love with this series too. If you like PLL, you're most likely going to be a fan of this series as well. SS is able to keep you guessing the whole time, and by the end of the book you only want more. I stumbled across this entirely by accident, and now I'm reading my way through the series. I won't post any spoilers, but it's different...yet the same as PLL. You're going to want to know who did it, but you won't be able to figure it out. The clues will keep you guessing, and the plot twists will make your heart race. You'll love some of the characters, then hate them... and then love them again. It's awesomely fun to read, and I can't wait to get the next one!","label":0}

{"text":"Took this camera particularly to use for \"cave tubing\" on rivers through mountain caves in Belize, Central America, as well as for use Snorkeling out in the Gulf of Mexico out on the Cayes offshore of Belize. Worked well on 2 outings, then the LED stopped working making the camera useless since you can't see what you are doing without the use of the LED screen on the back of the camera. I did rinse the camera off after use in fresh water river during the cave tubing outing, and soaked the camera in fresh water per MFR recommendations after using it and never exceeding 5' depth during the snorkeling outing. Thankfully the memory card saved the priceless nice photo's I took with this camera, however, the camera will have to be sent back under MFR warranty since it is not usable without the LED. Glad the pictures and the SD card saved the pictures, though am disappointed in it not working after just 2 outings and no misuse!","label":0}

{"text":"They arrived about six weeks after order, which isn't much longer than I expected given that they were shipping internationally. I haven't worn them yet, so I can't speak to quality, but they seem at least comparable to the ones from Claire's that I usually buy. There was one where the gem clearly wasn't glued in right, but it's a hideous color anyway so I couldn't have worn it. However, the color selection is not great. Based on other reviews, I thought it would be 2 sets of 10 colors, but I had 3 or 4 of 3 colors I'll never wear. There were also none of the colors I really did want, but that's my problem because it does say colors will vary. Regardless, based on the limited selection, I don't think I'll order these again.","label":0}

{"text":"Even though Belkin did a great job with a super thin and wide spaced keyboard with a Surface style stand, there is still scope of improvement in this product. Style and Design: Very elegant and classy looks. Well designed with all ports and connections easily accessible. Weight : 17.2 oz (1.075 lbs) slightly heavier than the iPad Air itself. Keyboard: Very thin and keys are designed to type faster. Some keys are oddly placed like \"\/\" has to be used with shift, \":\" is next to the space bar, and back arrow is placed close to pair button. I guess this will take some time to get used to. Smart function: Entirely missing. It does not automatically sleeps and wake your iPad. You have to do it manually. IPad Enlsosure: The interior side to hold iPad is a bit flimsy and not good quality as expected from the overall product. Its held by mere elastic bands. Exterior Surface: Good looks, can be wiped clean easily. Positions: Three standing positions in horizontal orientation. The keyboard cover can be fully folded into the back for reading in vertical orientation. However, it is a bit convenient due to more than twice the weight from iPad Air itself and hence not suited for long time reading. Overall, it is a good companion for typing and writing and may provide good value for money at about 50 bucks.","label":0}

It would have been a little better if the face had been recessed just slightly so that the outer edge of the rim would offer some protection.

{"text":"These are quality mics that were affordable and sound excellent. It's an easy system to set up and operate, everything was included to get started. Nothing feels cheap or junky about any of the parts. It really doesn't have the clarity and power that you might get out of a single microphone plugged into an amp because it's simply multiple mics running off it's own antenna receiver. However, it works perfectly for getting voices heard over a conference, church- something like that, it's perfect. And, it allows multiple people to have a mic and not have to pass one around.. that is always awkward and wastes time. It's a fantastic system! I posted a video that hopefully shows the system well and shows you all that it comes with and how it works.","label":1}

{"text":"This silicone bowl has a low-relief profile of a dog on the bottom. It easily pops up and stays put until flattened because of the sturdy plastic rim. The grass green color coordinates with many of my silicone kitchen accessories but there are lots of fun colors to choose from. The bowl is marketed for pets, but works well for human use, too, especially when space is limited, such as when travelling or in a boat or recreational vehicle. Toddlers can play with it in the bathtub or pool. The pleated sides and matte silicone make it easy to grip. The bowl holds about 12 oz. to the bottom of rim. It weighs 58 g ( 2 oz.). The outside diameter is 5 1\/16 in. at the rim, tapering down to a 3 9\/16 in. base, and the height is 2 1\/8 in. The little tab adds 9\/16 in. to the diameter. When collapsed, it is 9\/16 in. tall.

{"text":"We have 4 dogs, two who love the squeeker toys and two who are afraid of them. My review is for Min. Schnauzer who is 11 but acts like she's 6 mo. when presented with a \"squeeker\" and my male black lab who spends hours and hours just laying and squeeking. The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed\/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time. I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it. As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres. The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us. We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun.","label":0}

{"text":"The instance of this 'Evernote' stylus that I received and had high hopes for - in one word - SUCKS. It sucks really bad. Tried it on a variety of note taking apps for the iPad - Penultimate, Bamboo Paper & Note Taker HD [the latter is the best iPad note taking app on the app store btw - hands down!]. I really wanted to like this stylus and tried to get used to the quirks - but to no avail - so needless to say this is going back to Amazon. My gripes with this half baked product is 1) The OFFSET when writing is terrible, regardless the wrist position 2) the DELAY from when the pen touches the screen surface until something actually shows up on the screen is really bad - feels like a few tenths of a second and makes it impossible to write anything but really, really s-l-o-w 3) the tip FLEXES a bit which makes the feel when writing very awkward. I don't understand how the folks at Evernote ever got behind this product and promotes it they way they do. They should stick to software alone or at least do some rudimentary product testing before they put their name on it!","label":0}

I followed the directions, carefully charging them all the way up, discharging all the way down, several times, while loading a bunch of games, music apps, and wall paper onto each of them. I put a screen protectors on them and bought a TabSuit leather cases for protection. The gaming is impressive, due to the internal gyroscope\/accelerometer, one can play Angry Birds GO! as well as Driving games, by steering\/turning the tablet. The sound is about what you'd expect from a small device, but with ear phones is great. With heavy graphics & gaming, the battery lasts about 3-4 hours, and on stand-by or with music, the battery lasts days. No problems with Wi Fi, no problems with the display. The tablet has been working perfectly for a month with near daily use.","label":1}

{"text":"I purchased this lens for my wife as a Christmas present on Nov.16,2012 and after she opened it I decided to register the lens for the extended 4 yr. warranty which was included. I am dismayed and shocked that the paper work explicitly states several times that the warranty is invalid if the product is not registered within 10 days of purchase. This seems like some sort of scam that Nikon is using to weasel out of honoring the offered warranty. It remains to be seen if Nikon will stand behind this offer or not but I am very unhappy that the registration period is so short. So be warned, if the extended warranty is important to you, make sure you register as soon as you receive the lens. UPDATE--to Nikon's credit, I received a prompt reply to my email questioning whether they would honor the extended warranty--message follows-- \"Thank you for contacting Nikon. I do apologize for any inconvenience. Our Nikkor lenses comes with an additional 4 year warranty. In order to receive the additional 4 year warranty, you must register the lens as well as maintain the proof of purchase if any issues occur with the lens. Since it was a gift, if any issues occur and you need to send your camera to our service center, we recommend you state that in a brief description.\" no mention of the 10 day requirement here so why put it in the official paperwork? I guess we will see in a few years. Later update---ended up returning this lens anyway--my wife was not happy with it's performance and I was not happy with Nikon's wishy washy reply to my complaint.","label":0}

{"text":"You can see my story below on this unit. At this point I'm changing my review to come from a different perspective. No product is perfect. That is why customer support is so important. Every product has some percentage of units that have issues. The better designed and made the product, the lower the percentage, but the percentage is never zero. I would have to believe from the reviews on Amazon, that the Trym II has very few units that have issues. I just happened to get one of them. That's where customer support comes in. In our house, we recently had a flagship smartphone from a well know fruit company have a swollen battery. It wasn't a big deal, because we took it down to the local fruit store and promptly got a replacement. I don't hold the faulty phone against them - because it happens. No matter how great the design or manufacturing process. In fact, I continue to buy from them with confidence, because I know they stand behind their products. The makers of Trym II have shown that they stand behind their product, too. And I have to say, that is much harder to do at this low price point than it is for the big fruit company. If you're considering this trimmer, I can whole heartedly recommend that you purchase it. The product works great and if by some extremely small chance your unit has issues - the company stands behind it's product. ** UPDATE 8\/22\/2014 ** I have received a full replacement trimmer (including all attachments and accessories) by 2 day UPS delivery. Another win for Pure Enlightenment customer support. ** UPDATE 8\/21\/2014 ** I have received a tracking number for a replacement unit that is to be delivered tomorrow. ** UPDATE 8\/20\/2014 ** I was contacted by A to Zen support shortly after my review went live. I was asked to provide a mailing address and told a replacement unit would be sent. I'll update again when I hear anything further. Purchased on Dec 17, 2013. Died on August 14, 2014. I actually liked this trimmer a lotwhen it was working. But an 8 month life span isn't good enough. The trimmer does look nice, but don't mistake that for a quality build. The pictures make it look much nicer than it actually is. I think what this trimmer had going for it was the simple plastic \"hair guides\". A lot of the other trimmers have a single cage that adjusts and in my experience those just don't work very well. I'm going back to using my monstrous Wahl hair clippers on my face. Not exactly an elegant solution, but my Wahl clippers are at least a decade old. And they still work. Imagine that.","label":0}

{"text":"I believe this is the same product as the http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B003AKF4EE I decided to replace the rollers after one of my garage springs broke. The original rollers were nylon but did not have any bearings. The repair technician showed me the easiest way to replace them. Take a vise grip plier and bend out the metal side track about 2 inches after the curve from vertical to horizontal. Which is sold by Sanford and Son Overhead Doors too. The only difference is that these are sealed bearings. For the bottom roller, bend out a section of track 6 inches before the bend from vertical to horizontal. Align the bottom roller to the open section of the track pop out the roller and replace it. Bend back the track. Align one of the rollers and use a large screwdriver between the track and side of the roller to pop the roller out of the track. Of course you will have to hold up the section of the garage door. Replace the old roller and pop in the new roller into the track. Repeat for the rest of the rollers except for the bottom roller. Use the plier and bend back the track. This will be the easiest way rather than pulling out the side rails or removing the hinges.","label":1}

If you have tried other products or are paying too much for medicated creams then try this facewash and skincare out.","label":0}

{"text":"Although my daughter in law loved the look of the Joovy high chair as well as the ease of set up and also how comfortable the chair looked for the baby - she returned it! The way the tray is set up it does not allow it to be moved in close enough to the baby and everything the babe tries to put in her mouth goes down the front of her right in her lap! She tried a few different methods like putting a rolled up blanket between the baby and tray but it still made quite a mess! My daughter in law was disappointed she had to return the Joovy but this one con (tray) outweighed the other pros to the Highchair. Amazon makes it incredibly easy for returns and in absolutely no time had our account credited!","label":0}

The self-righting feature works well (from what I can tell, it works by using the torque of the motor when you alternate from reverse to forward quickly). The boat is hard to capsize on smooth, calm water; however, it flips over easily in rough water. The hull seems very durable. The digital transmitter has great range and uses the same frequency spectrum as cordless telephones (much better than the older transmitters that use the standard telescoping metal antenna). Great boat for the price.","label":1}

{"text":"After two excellent seasons, the question is: how much longer this show can keep up with its own success? Where season two had a build-up that went through the whole season, it took me awhile to figure out where this one was headed. Lots of new bad guys were introduced, and dispatched. But lots of plot threads were introduced and developed. Eventually, one especially noticeable bad guy appeared, and didn't get dispatched, so it became clear how the season would wind up; the only remaining question was how it would unfold. The bad guy was a prominent one-season bad guy from another TV show. He does creepy really well. In the interest of avoiding any kind of spoiler, I won't say who it is, but those of you who saw that other show a couple years ago will recognize him immediately. I don't know if it was the complexity of all the plot threads, or whether they were presented less clearly as in previous seasons, but it wasn't always obvious why things were happening. There are many things to note and remember to really get what's going on, but the problem is there are many other things that aren't essential to the main thread going on, too. There are hints about how it will all end sprinkled liberally through the plot. Even so, it is satisfying to watch it all unfold. BOTTOM LINE: Four Stars (\"I Like It\"). I thought the first two seasons were excellent, and this was a small notch down. I'll watch the fourth season.","label":0}

{"text":"First, I'd like to say don't pay attention to any review that isn't a verified purchase. More than likely they're reviewing an incorrect TV or just bad mouthing Samsung. I was checking daily for this TV to show up on Amazon. I did so because I was holding out for the new Samsung TV line to come out. I bought this set on 3\/6\/15, the day it came out. There was immediately a review shortly thereafter from someone which I knew it was complete BS. That review claimed that the TV arrived with dust on it and spelled \"welcome\" incorrectly and all these problems of clouding blah blah blah. It wasn't true in the least. I'm telling ya, don't consider any review that isn't a verified purchase. This TV is really great so far. I got this specific model because it was literally the only new Samsung TV that wasn't curved. I wasn't sold on curved after doing a ton of reviewing about it and checking it out in the store. Purchased on 3\/6 and it got here about 3\/10.. The packing was really well. You'll need basic tools to put the cable detangler\/stand on. I was able to do it myself. Unlike the other reviews, I had no problem connecting to Wifi. I did start wireless at first no problems, but now have it connected to an Apple Airport Extreme that I use as an accesspoint to hardwire both my TV and my PS4(for the purpose of faster download\/upload speed of course). My TV did update immediately upon purchase and I found it updating within the first couple of days often (probably due to new release, getting bugs out) The video is great. I haven't tested 4k via netflix or the sort yet, but have been playing games on the PS4 and streaming video from my Apple Macbook Pro over to the Panasonic. What I wasn't a fan of at first, but now like is the One Connect Mini. The TV is otherwise naked as far as connecting ports without it(no hdmi on the TV directly itself). I have come to like it because one of the problems I've had in my other TVs is that the HDMI cable had a hardtime staying connected into the port when it was horizontally hanging from the middle\/upper corner of the TV. The cable would eventually just get loose, droop downward giving it a weak connection. The one connect mini fixes that, but it still seems odd the TV doesn't have at least ONE HDMI port directly on it, in case ya know, something happens to the One Connect Mini. This is why it doesn't get 5 stars. You shouldn't need box that is like an accessory for a TV. Also I noticed that the One Connect Mini isn't universal among all points. Like I can't plug my PS4 or computer into one of the ports at one side etc. I am about to pick up a Roku 3 or Apple TV to stream video over wirelessly. The remote is pretty cool and accessing the menu options etc is a piece of cake. The remote is motion sensitive and is your primary way of guiding through the TV(though the power button the back will allow you to toggle through as well). I have this in my room and doesn't experience any clouding. Granted in the sun, I can see reflections such as blinds etc, but overall I really am happy with the purchase.","label":0}

After watching the first 5 episodes, my wife turned to me and asked me if this season was meant to punish us because we were Community fans and we wanted a fifth season. I mean, Dan Harmon may be back, but the stories aren't what they used to be. The light-hearted escapism prevalent in the past have been replaced with something very heavy-handed and trying too hard.

(to be fair, I also love these things :)), and once I received it, I showed it to my kid and he was excited and told me that he wants to see it when it flies. So I got a joystick and saw that it doesn't receives any signal from helicopter. Firstly, I thought that it's because of batteries, logically, but the batteries were in, so I was confused. I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((. I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http:\/\/amzn.to\/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :). In the end, my kid was happy to see it on air, so I was also :)).","label":1}
{"text":"Looks great when together. Going to repeat what some others have said here, you do get what you pay for, it isn't all that sturdy with just their materials. To alleviate this: 1) I put angle braces at each of the 4 corners (these at the top) and then put 4 on each of the corners made from the centerboards (these on the bottom side, right at the floor). 2) I screwed down the slats to the two center rails, two screws per slat per board, and also drilled a small hole through metal rail at the foot of the bed and drove more wood screws there through the slats just to make sure everything stayed where I wanted it, BEFORE doing this make sure the frame is straight and your drawers close all the way!!! It's now really sturdy and doesn't have the wobble it did, only time will tell if this will last now.

{"text":"The book is very informative, up-to-date and easy to follow and will certainly aid you in the creation of your trust. The creation of a trust is essential to ensure the costly approach of probate can be avoided. Having a previous experience where my fathers estate was virtually wiped out due to probate, I cannot stress how important a trust is. His estate was valued just over $105k, I received around $17k after probate. Probate costs work off the gross value of the estate not the net. I will ensure this dreadful experience is not passed on to my family. The forms themselves are easy to follow with a good set of instructions. They can be downloaded or are available on the CD-Rom which accompanies the book. Each trust has a binding arbitration clause to ensure where beneficiaries contest your decisions, they effectively agree to receive almost nothing. Having visited an attorney, this was highly recommended so it was a relief to see this contained in the forms","label":1}

{"text":"This is an odd device. I can't figure out what the intended market is. It seems less useful than a Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, and there is no cost advantage. It does a number of things, but none of them really well. And it has some major flaws. The most obvious is that it has an attached stand that does not fold or adjust and is not removable. This makes it awkward to hold and to carry. It also has a battery life of only 90 minutes, so it works best as a stationary object plugged into an outlet, but then there is no advantage to it being small and light. I found it to be convenient for watching YouTube videos and listening to internet radio, and that is probably the only way I will use it. I tried Skype, but the person with whom I was Skyping said that the picture quality was very poor, so there seems to be a problem with my camera. I also tried using it for photo slideshows, but the resolution was not very good. And finally, it has an insensitive touchscreen which requires pressure for the touch to be effective. It basically feels like old technology at a new technology price. I think there is a lot of room for improvement.","label":0}

But despite this weight reduction it is still very firm and sturdy in quality and in \"grip-ability\".  as I said the video...isn't fantastic there is a lot of important parts \"video\" wise that were left out from the 6D but I am a photographer not a videographer.

{"text":"Halo Reach is up there with Modern Warfare 2 and Battlefield 3 as the best shooter of the xbox 360 generation. This is simply an incredible game. The graphics are grittier. The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy. There is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans. Where Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game. What makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate. But then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes. Because this is, after all, a video game. Still, I appreciated that early part. I really like this game.","label":0}

{"text":"I was sent this and and neither one managed to last longer than three days. When I first pulled it from its packaging, I was surprised at how small it was, but I decided to follow the directions and get it set up. Then the first evening rolled around and it illuminated my entire front porch, much stronger than another outdoor light I'd been using, and the motion detection worked very well. I was amazed beyond words and I was so thrilled that first night that the next morning, I moved my previous outdoor light and put this one up instead. Day three rolls around and I noticed one evening when I went out that the light didn't work. (The other light died on the second day.) I thought that was odd. Then on the fourth day, I noticed that the light would come on around dusk--not unusual--and the motion detection would work as expected, but a few hours later, dead. For some strange reason, it seems the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge, which is odd considering I live in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight here, and this is placed in location that receives direct sunlight for nearly 10+ hours a day. I even tried cleaning off the solar panel, but still no joy. So, yeah, it still works, but only for a few hours each night and by the time it's fully dark out, it's useless. I've since moved my previous outdoor light back and although it's not as bright as this one, it's still going strong all night through.","label":1}

{"text":"An excellent portable Bluetooth speaker. Connected immediately to my iPad, iPhone and my husband's Samsung Galaxy phone. It comes complete with a USB connection (to enable you to charge the speaker) .On taking the speaker out of its own box I swiched it on and within seconds a VERY LOUD voice told me that it was Pairing and then the same loud voice told me it was connected. I am amazed at the ease of using this speaker. During the day (the battery lasted all day without my charging it) I had a few calls on my phone. I was able to answer the calls through the speaker. It cuts out the music whilst answering the calls. Also buttons to go forwards and backwards through the songs and also buttons to allow you to adjust the sound. I was able to take the speaker around the whole house with me during the day. The battery lasted 10 hours. I was amazed. It now automatically connects when I switch it on due to the NFC function but I admit when pairing for the first time you need to have the item close to speaker to enable it to pair so easily. We highly recommend this speaker not only because of the ease of using it but for value for money. Any other speaker of the same calibre would cost a lot more. Do not hesitate, it is super.","label":1}

{"text":"This book collects the Tenth Doctor's first comic book stories, with all but the last one having Rose as his companion. The strips originally appeared in Doctor Who Magazine Issues 365-380 and the the 2007 Doctor Who Story Book. The Betrothal of Sontar (365-367): The first 10th Doctor comic book story and the titular story from this collection finds the Doctor on an arctic world where a bunch of deviations in the Sontarans have a base far from the action of the war and under the command of a purebred Sontaran who ends ups using the Doctor to find a doomsday weapon. This is actually the weakest story in the book. It's a Sontaran story where no one acts like a Sontaran. The purebed Sontaran has a mustache and sits around alone with his chest plate off revealing a hairy chest and wears fur shoulder pads. Even with a generic alien, this would be an average story. For bungling the Sontarans, it's a notch below that. Grade: D+ The Lodger (368): The Doctor is stuck on Earth and living with Mickey for a spell. The story is fun and does a nice job putting the Doctor into a unique situation. Roberts would later take the idea of the comic and make it a TV script for the 11th Doctor. You'll find the barebones of the idea here but other than the Doctor being good at soccer, little of the plot crosses over. Grade: A- F.A.Q. (369-371): This is a story that actually is reminiscent of \"Fear Her\" (a story that aired in the same series as the comic strips), so it's weird the magazine ran this one. The story is better than \"Fear Her\" but the similarities are striking. At any rate, the Doctor and Rose arrive in a block where weird things are happening and people are disappearing and strange things start happening including mysterious disappearance and three boys being turned into trees. It all seems to center on a boy and is sister. This story twists around like a pretzel, it's very clever and rich with a lot of emotion, psychology, andmisdirection at work. The commentary in the back reveals the real life modeling of the characters which makes the story even more enjoyable. Great concept and really good execution. Grade: A The Futurists (372-374): This is the type of story you see in comics, audio, and novels, but never on the TV series as we have a story based on an obscure fact of history, sprinkle in sci fi and enjoy. In this case, the Doctor and Rose land in Italy between the Wars where the Futurists are beginning a movement that would become Italian fascism. An alien transports one of these Futurists back in time and gives him the chance to conquer the world. This is a wonderfully researched story that has several great twists in the final parts. Mike Collins art is great throughout the book (excepting some of the Sontaran designs in the first story of course.) but this is his best work in the book. I love his drawings of 1920s Italy and the clothing for the era is superb too. There's also a few nice humor bits sprinkled throughout.I loved Rose showing the psychic paper to an illiterate soldier. Grade: A+ Interstellar Overdrive (375-376): The TARDIS lands on a tour ship featuring a zombified singer leading a band of misfit has-beens. Of course, there's a murder mystery and a few nice end-jokes. The Time Loop that's a big plot device for the cliffhanger is a bit weak as the Doctor and Rose remember everything which serves to expedite the time loop solution but also isn't really how those things should work. Still, this is a fun story. Grade: B+ Opera of Doom (2007 Doctor Who Story Book): This story finds the Doctor taking Rose to the opera where strange things are afoot and an alien eats music. This is a story that's too short but that's really the fault of the BBC which demanded a shorter length to protect its Doctor Who Annual and that hurt this tale. It could have done with a few more pages, but it's okay as is with a nice comic and some good lines. Grade:B The Green Eyed Monster (DWM 377): In Rose's final comic story, writer Nev Fountain decided to play with the idea promoted by many that Rose and her crew were kind of poor and trashy where Rose's adventures with the Doctor and one adventure in particular are fodder for a Jerry Springereseque Daytime talk show. This strip not only gets Mickey in, but also Jackie and in a quiet unusual way. Fountain manages to gently poke fun at some of Doctor Who's tropes as an alien princess tells the Doctor, \"Our scientists have been mystified as to why our planet is solely populated by stunningly attractive with physical ages of eighteen to twenty.\" The strip does a lot in 10 pages, playing with Rose's jealousy of other women around the Doctor, perceptions of the Tyler family, and even works a riff of Peter Davison's famous line from the Fury of the Deep. Nicely done. Grade: A The Warkeeper's Crown: The only visual teaming of the Brigadier and a revived series Doctor finds the Brigadier kidnapped from a Remembrance Day ceremony in full uniform. He arrives to find he's being asked to lead a war-like species into battle because he's the greatest military leader the Doctor knows. They also kidnap Mike Yates, however instead of the Brigadier's former UNIT aide, they kidnap a back bench member of parliament whose kind of petty. There are a few confusing points in the plot, but this is ultimately a love letter to the Brigadier and it works. It's a great dynamic between the post-time War Doctor and the Brigadier as the Brig realizes that the Doctor has been a war. Good stuff. Also, a key moment from the Series 8 finale may have had its genesis in the last page of this comic. Grade: A- With the exception of the first story, I found most everything else in the book to be thoroughly enjoyable. There are some great concepts. Even though, many of these were planned with very little known of the 10th Doctor they captured the character well. Rose was usually pretty good, though she did occasionally become a bit of a comic foil. This is a very solid volume of comics from Doctor Who magazine that's a must read for fans of the 10th Doctor.","label":0}
{"text":"There's much more afoot here than what get more commonly delivered in the average Pinky\/Pinku film (which this is and is not). With an almost macabre 'After-School Special' quality, FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING tries to be about more than the act of sex and\/or the glorification of rape (a staple of many similar Japanese films, especially those under the 'Female Teacher' label). One of the characters remarks, by their nature, \"guppies make the best of bad situations,\" and that's not a sentiment normally explored when the pursuit of skin is paramount. Likewise, HUNTING frankly tries to say something about human nature - not just commenting separately on the roles for the male and female of the species - and it comes in the delivery of a smart script that tries to give some psychological underpinnings to the actions of its various players. At this point, let me add the noble aside of \"Yes, yes, if you're only here for the simulated sex, there's plenty for you to!\" (NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters. If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment. If, however, you're accepting of few modest hints at 'things to come,' then read on ...) Two students - Kuriyama Daisuke (played by Hajime Ishigami) and Murakami Midori (a girl, Kyoko Ito, looking a bit like a puckish Filipino boy - are skinny-dipping in the academy pool. Though the audience isn't shown, it's clearly implied that they're more than a bit frisky about the whole affair, and some unseen prankster is shown stealing Midori's school uniform from the poolside where it sits. However, the next day, rumors persist around the school that Kuriyama raped Midori. Apparently hoping to preserve her reputation, Midori doesn't come to her young beau's defenses, leaving their teacher Miss Kyoko Sakatani (Yoko Azusa) to push for the boy's possible prosecution. School breaks before Kuriyama can prove his innocence - though not before he really does stick it to Midori for not defending him - and our cast go their separate ways ... but their story is just beginning. Kuriyama sulks about a seaside town where he's taken in by a surly shopkeeper and his sultry mistress, and - before you can say one-two-three - he finds himself knee-deep in the weirdest menage a trois this side of Huey, Louie, and Dewey (never a legitimate menage, so far as I know, but a darn clever pun). What we learn here is that the young man has lived a life exposed to some of deepest, darkest sexual exploitation perhaps known to a young mind, and, despite those circumstances, he's done his best to repress giving in to them at school. In the greater world outside, however, he eventually succumbs to these hot advances of a kinda\/sorta would-be stepmother and earns his stripes amongst this kinky duo. In the meantime, his school girlfriend Midori finds herself pestered by a curious phone prank who may know more about what really happened back at the pool; and the lovely but na\u00efve Miss Sakatani spends the summer exploring her own sex life with a married man (the rape investigator) with a take-charge attitude. And, seriously ... that's only half the story! HUNTING packs an awful lot of narrative into its slim, trim 65 minutes and still manages to deliver up the steamy scenes, some that are conventional lovemaking and others that flitter and flirt with sexual assault, so much so that it becomes impossible to decipher what it might all mean. Director Junichi Suzuki directs a script from Hiroshi Saito that layers on the heavy insinuation that what's really being exploited here are social role models (i.e. teachers as authority figures; students as hungry for learning and direction; rape case workers as doing what's upright and honorable; etc.). What becomes increasingly clear isthat the lines between consent versus dissent have grown increasingly blurred in a society prone to 'hunting' for real meaning - who am I, what do I want, and how do I go about getting it. For example, Midori's merry telephone prankster, Tanaka, has his own fetishistic hang-ups (fantasies) which cause him to start and spread the rumors about her being raped, and these essentially spring from his own inability to engage his classmate in a real-world relationship. When forced to come to terms with them, he unsuccessfully sexually assaults Midori, but their conflict is far from over as we'll eventually see him coaxed toward better results in a scene ripe with allegory (as well as one staged and shot with crisp, near-romantic angles by cinematographer Yonezo Maeda). But perhaps an even better example involves Miss Sakatani. As the gallant teacher, she's intent upon putting Kuriyama's world in order, appealing to him in the picture's opening to not drop out of school because of what he insists are rumors of his assault on Midori. She wants the system to give the boy a chance to be found innocent. Later in the film - when she realizes he indeed may be - she seeks him out, hoping to make things right. What ends up happening is the young man rapes her - a startling development - but one not nearly as surprising as her reaction afterward when it appears she's pleased with herself! Away from her, Kuriyama vomits, coming to grips with what he's become; away from him, Sakatani smiles, content that she's finally made him into what she was led to believe he was. I hope I haven't spoiled too much of the story here, but, as is often the case when folks explore Pinku films, it isn't so much for the plot as it is the skin. My only desire in discussing this further - much more than I usually do - is to point out that there was far more being explored here than in the traditional skin flick; and - in whatever small way - that underscored why I'moccasionally drawn to these films. Too easily, they get dismissed as little more than pornography meant to instill whatever crass value system might be at work in an industry exploiting women for the sum of their body parts; but every now and then one comes along that challenges those biases - almost thumbs its nose at those assumptions - and, as implied by the title HUNTING, the cast and crew were trying something a bit different here. That deserves to be pointed out. As is your right, you don't have to agree with the message; as is my right, I'm only challenging others to appreciate the effort. FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING (1982) is produced by Isao Hayashi for Nikkatsu. DVD distribution stateside is being handled through Impulse Pictures under its popular \"Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection\" imprint. For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Japanese spoken-language film with English subtitles (no dubbing track available). As for the technical specifications, it looks and sounds surprisingly solid for its modest age; director Junichi Suzuki should even be commended for incorporating some clever cinematography and curious sound editing choices to add greater depth to what could've otherwise ended up as a bloated, soap-opera-ish story. As for the special features, the disc is light - it bears only the original theatrical trailer - but the packaging includes some wonderfully informative liner notes by noted expert on Japanese film, Jasper Sharp. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you understand the metaphor, then think of FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING as the Merchant Ivory of Pinky porn, with a script so layered and a climax so royally screwed up that Sigmeund Freud probably would've soiled himself trying to decipher the conflicting and conflicted messages. Still, if your taste is anything from the Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection, this one will definitely give you something to think about as its chocked full of talent who can actually act, a scriptthat tries to give erudite subtext to the sexuality it explores, and probably the worst 'stepmother' figure in the history of film ... or the greatest, depending upon your predilections. In the interest of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Impulse Pictures provided me with an advance DVD copy of FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","label":0}

{"text":"In December of 2012 my AST was 65. After adding cinnamon to my diet to reduce blood sugar (which it did dramatically), in June 2013 my AST was 127. Since I am on niaspan and livalo, my doctor suspected they may have caused the elevated readings. I just randomly happened upon nutritionfacts.org after that office visit, and browsing through articles, noticed [...] Here's a partial transcript: The use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial. We know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one's blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming 2 teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test. Basically they make you drink some sugar water and see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control, and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike. A half teaspoon doesn't seem to be enough\u2026 but about a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference. A review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly. So what's the controversy? Cassia cinnamon, also known as chinese cinnamon, or probably what you're getting at the store if it just says cinnamon contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver in high enough doses. For little kids, just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much, and a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone. Nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia. Research shows blunting of blood sugars in response to cassia cinnamon, but in response to Ceylon cinnamon, nothing. Google Korintje liver to see lots of warnings, but you will not see any on the product description here, or on general nutrition advice websites, or from dieticians and (most) doctors., or from dieticians and (most) doctors.","label":0}

{"text":"\ud83c\udfa5 Video review. \ud83c\udfa5 *UPDATE* I went onset today and actually saw a professional crew using these lights. Personal tip: Get this light from Selens instead of the \"Neewer\" (\"best seller\") here on Amazon. (Link here: ) They're essentially the same price, but this one from Selens is much brighter and has more features. Pros: \u2705 Stunningly bright. \u2705 Solid, quality feel. Not like the Neewer light, which felt pretty cheap and plasticy. \u2705 Easy to adjust brightness using dial. (see my video) \u2705 Gels (filters) are very useful. Cuts the glare. \u2705 Versatile: You can use lots of different kinds of batteries. I personally use my Canon 70D batteries, since I have a lot of those already. You can also use 6X AA batteries (not included). \u2705 Hot shoe mount fits my Canon 70D beautifully. \u2705 As far as I can tell, there's no high-pitched whine like I hear on other LED lights. \u2705 Very nice people at Selens. They actually sent me this light to test and video review. Cons: \ud83c\udf45 Does not get hot. My bacon stayed limp and never crisped whilst laying upon it. Though it still smelled like Christmas.

{"text":"There have been many attempts to create educational \"games\" over the years. During the early days of home computing, most kids saw right through this (though I admit to quite enjoying Where in the World is Carmen San Diego before realizing it was teaching me stuff). Beyond those early days, I have very little exposure to learning games, but like many parents, I feel better with my child running \"educational\" software rather than midless space shooters. With that in mind, here are my impressions of this LeapFrog title... Last year, I got my then-3 year old son a LeapPad 2, and earlier this year I got to upgrade him to a LeapPad 3 so we could review it for Amazon. Since then, he has accumulated a small variety of cartridges for it, and he spends time on his \"green iPad.\" He still prefers to watch YouTube toy review videos on his mom's real iPad, though. For his 4th birthday, he received a new Thomas the Tank Engine playset and this Rainforest cartridge. He was thrilled at the new Thomas set, but I managed to get him to spend a bit of time with the LeapPad. The game spends some time with cute animations an narrations explaining what it is about. He was not in the mindset to focus on all the talking and was trying to skip through them. Once the actual game began, it appeared to be a platform-style game. My son has not become video game obsessed yet (he still prefers real world play), so I helped him a bit with basic controls. The character walked through the rainforest until it touches an animal. Then, icons come up and dialog plays describing attributes of different types of animals. It then asks the player to choose what type of animal they just found. It followed up with a similar thing about types of feed (webbed, bird claws, etc.) and asks about that. At least in the first stage, it appeared to be a simple \"I'll tell you something, then ask you a question\" quiz program, disguised as a platform game. Ithought it was neat (though as a child, I would have found it a very un-fun video game, but certainly a more entertaining educational title). My son, however, soon went back to moving toy trains around his new multi-level playset. I expect he will revisit this title in coming months\/years (it has a good age range), but it is clear that right now, video games won't pull him away from the Island of Sodor. I don't find anything particular bad about this title, and it seems an entertaining way to learn about animals and such. I suppose if you child is more in to rainforest stuff than trains, they would find this far more interesting.","label":0}

My husband can't tolerate spicy food, so most of the book was pointless for us. 3. Most of these recipes also contain nightshades (tomatoes, eggplants, etc.) that, in a Paleo diet, are to be eaten in moderation due to their alkaloid content. Nightshades have been shown to increase inflammation. 4.She sure talks about herself a lot. I was curious to learn more about where these recipes came from, but pretty much every page was about Arsy, how she's Armenian, and what Armenians like to eat.

{"text":"I held off purchasing this mouse because I was skeptical that a 40 dollar mouse could sway me not to buy a razer or a steel series gaming mouse. I was wrong. This mouse is hassle free. Extremely comfortable. Easy to use and set up. The software is simple even for non gamers to set up and manage. The clicks sound and feel great. The tracking is superb. The adjustable weights are perfect. There is nothing I can say bad about this mouse. If you are looking for a gaming mouse with out al the bugs or the high price? Get this one! You will NOT be sorry! Been using it for over a month now and I game hard with it. Shooters, mmorpg's, stratedy games, you name it. Cant make this mouse lag out or miss a shot and the easy to click dpi helps you zero in on your selected\/intended target very easily. Buy with confidence that it will last you a very long time and that you will be able to use it for any application. Oh....one more thing...I have not found a surface that this mouse wont track on. I even stuck it on my head with all the hair and it still didnt miss a beat lol. BUY IT!","label":1}

{"text":"I seem to use these straight long reach pliers the most of all the other types of long reach pliers I have. They are super handy for getting into hard to reach places to retrieve things like dropped screws and nuts. The tips on these pliers align nicely and the vinyl grips are fairly decent, but tend to damage easily, however I think for what little they cost, they are reasonably well made, so I can't really complain. When these wear out I may upgrade to a more expensive brand, but for right now they are doing everything I need so I'm happy with them.","label":0}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this bracelet. Yes, it looks GREAT. The clarity and cut of swarovski crystals is fantastic, and Amazon did a great job and procuring a bracelet that was well built. All gems are centered properly, links are clean (a little rough in terms of fluidity in the chain though). There's no ugly glue, off-centering, different sized\/clarity gems on this. Two things: 1) The bracelet arrives in two plastic bags inside of a manila envelope. So make sure you get a box to go with it. There's also a tag that says \"MADE IN CHINA\" along with the Swarovski certification tag. So make sure you remove that. Nothing says \"I love you.. kind of\" than a big \"MADE IN CHINA\" tag still on a piece of jewelry. 2) THE CLASP! What people are saying is true. This is a hit and miss. If you're not doing much and you wear short sleeves or a dress, you should not have significant issues\/risks of losing the bracelet. If you're wearing a sweater or jacket or something that is porous, this bracelet WILL catch the fabric and flip open one of the clasps within a few minutes of merely walking and swinging your arms. We knew the risk and tested the bracelet out when it first arrived. One clasp opened quickly. Merely putting your hand down on the table with the release lever facing down was enough to disengage the bracelet when both clasps were missing. Upon further inspection, the diamonds on top of the clasp itself seem weird, since they're not aligned with the rest of the bracelet. A watch style clasp with just a smooth locking mechanism would have been MUCH better in comparison. So yes. This is a great piece. But it's not for every day use, which is why ultimately we decided to return it. If you know you won't wear it with sleeves, your risk of it catching are greatly reduced (warning: it can catch on the seams of your pants). It looks great, expensive, but the high risk of it falling and being lost forever are too great to justify keeping it. FYI, we bought the 7.25\" length and it was a good fit.","label":0}

{"text":"As a parent and now grandparent of game-lovers, I am always on the lookout for games that adults can play along with little ones. Unlike many of games geared toward children, Ravensburger's \"Race To The Roof\" does not cause adults to cringe when a child presents it for playing. \"Race To The Roof\" can be played with and enjoyed by children who are younger than the suggested age range of 5 years or older. The objects to be located are ones with which most children will be familiar; if not, the unfamiliar items provide a learning opportunity. Counting the spaces one must move reinforces the ability to sequence numbers. Having to move backward gives children the opportunity to \"overcome\" a set-back and to learn that luck sometimes plays a part in who wins and who loses. The quality of Ravensburger's \"Race To The Roof\" is a bit less than I would have expected. Instead of a game board that is one-piece and hinged in the center, \"Race To The Roof\" has a two piece game-board. Unlike older board-game playing surfaces, this item is not constructed of a very heavy cardboard. While it might be somewhat difficult for very young children to damage, determined three-year olds would have no trouble bending the pieces. The wooden game pieces are unevenly painted; our yellow picec shows the wood-grain around its center point. Illustrations are simplistic; this seems to be a trend with illustrations in books as well as in games. Ravensburger produces games that are both fun to play and provide learning opportunities for children. I would like to see Ravensburger use better quality components so that their games last through several children and can be kept by parents to be played with future generations.","label":0}
{"text":"I love the product, but I wish Amazon had more pictures on the page because some of the designed I wanted are printed on the same sheet of paper. I was looking for certain designs and it is hard to pick out stuff like this on the internet. I had no way to get to a craft shop, so I chose Amazon for my supplies. While I think I have a lot of nice things to work with for the decorations I plan to make, some of the patterns I want to use from this collection I can't because it is on the opposite side of another one I want to use.

{"text":"This is a film that one either loved or hated. Though I do not necessarily fall into the political spectrum that is reflected in this quasi-anti-war film, I have to acknowledge it was very well-made, utterly inventive, and refreshingly different. The plot is straightforward(or so it seems) wherein a toy company has to decide whether to further stock 'war toys'. A battle, in words and deeds, ensues, with creative special effects and innovative visuals. Remember this was much earlier than 'Toy Story', etc. Robin Williams is at his best and this takes on special significance in light of recent events. LL Cool J is, well, cool. The fussy 'general' character is a stereotype, but that is what was called for in the script. It all blends wonderfully in a film that will surprise you and make you think...","label":0}

A little weak on lower frequency but you can dial in to compensate. They break up nice. Not floppy and not harsh sounding. Also compared them to Jenson ceramic C10. The C-10 had greater mid range and were in my opinion a little muddy sounding in comparison. They are a bit tight but suspect will loosen up with break in. Overall pleased.

At one point the program became totally unresponsive and I had to shut it down manually. When the \"upgrade\" was first installed it would display the test results for a couple of runs, then it stopped doing so. Before the software upgrade, the program was functional if quirky. Now it's useless. I hate to spend the money twice but I may have to. Now I'm looking for a better program with software that isn't so flaky.","label":0}

They are both a little darker than the photos but none the less vibrant and awesome to look at. Aesthetics aside, I did a lot of research before I ordered these mats, and in terms of price and quality Aurorae is definitely giant strides ahead of most others in the mat manufacturing business. We've owned mats before that were more expensive than these and lasted quite awhile, but were nowhere near as comfortable and well made. I highly recommend giving your mats a good bath before you use them. You're not supposed to use oil based detergents but we'd run out of Dr B's non oil-based castile soap and just used the lavender oil-based one which worked fine, (not surprising since it's such an awesome soap) then set the mats out to dry in the sun. I've come to find that no matter how you wash your mat, this step is very important. The sun further removes the resin that's been applied before shipping. Bottom line? This mat is thicker, longer, more durable, and made with better material than most other mats you'll find for this price. As an added bonus, the designs are really cool and the customer service is prompt and personable. You can't go wrong with one of these beautiful mats.","label":0}

Although, I found out it is not what I was looking for.

This was pretty frustrating because sometimes even the smallest drop in weight makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I wanted something that would be accurate every time I stepped on it. I dealt with this for a little while before doing serious research and getting a scale that I LOVE. I have owned it for over a month now and can say it is accurate every single time!

I was so looking forward to it and was excited to receive an e-mail that it had arrived at my front door. I raced home from work to do to do my chores that I had planned on quickly just so that I would have time to really sit back, enjoy and read the instructions and actually get to know the Wii. In the first hour and and a half I had \"carefully\" (literally, since this is my first ever expensive game I bought for myself) unpacked the game and had hooked it all up. I even connected the Wii to the internet, downloaded Netflix and started to watch a movie that I had started on my laptop a few days ago. Everything was going great until... I decided to play \"Just Dance 4\", the game came with the Wii Console, it was a bundle. After all, why not try the game out since I was going to start working out to the game tomorrow that is why I actually but the console in the first place. I started the game picked the song that I was going to dance to to and the entire console... JUST DIED! It just \"cut-off\"! Now the game is stuck inside the darn thing and I can't get it out! I tried to unplug the power supply and wait a few minutes because that's what the trouble shoot instructions said to do but nothing. I had the game plugged to a wall surge protector. I'M SO DEPRESSED! I really wanted this Wii because it is so much fun. Reminds me when I played this particular game with my niece. I knew from that moment on that I wanted to own one not only because it is fun but because it is a great way to stay in shape. So here I am almost 4 hours later requesting a return which I really wanted a replacement but no can do and writing a review all on the same day of receiving it.","label":0}

The top one is rated at 2.4A\/5V and is designed for charging tablets and larger devices while the bottom one is rated at 1.5A\/5V and is designed for charging smartphones and smaller devices. There is a blue indicator light that lets you know when the charger is plugged in correctly and pulling power. This is nice because sometimes I don't push my chargers in all the way, plus they are easy to see in the dark. Overall, its an excellent charger. This charger only includes the charger, there are no extra cables included. There is also a 24 month warranty that comes with this purchase so you know you are covered if you have any problems.","label":1}

{"text":"I'd go into a long story about what I use this product for, but suffice it to say that it helps my system perform well in the morning....No over the counter drugs or laxatives for me. They can reek havoc with your organs. This is natural and combined with a little bit of Oat Bran (usually a 4 to 1 ratio) will give it a little less card-boardy taste. Three tablespoons in the morning and three at night with a glass of water before each meal does the trick....This vendor delivered the product quickly and was just what I ordered...will order from them again when this supply runs out.

I did some research and people raved about this so I tried it. Wow! It works! I've been using it for about 4 weeks now (with no more prescription cream) and my lips have yet to get chapped again.

{"text":"This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring\/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky). Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash. I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket. Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.","label":0}

{"text":"Some of the reviews scared me, but the Vue was pleasantly surprising. It is very similar to the extended height chair that I use with my standing height desk at work. CONSTRUCTION Compared to other office chairs that I've put together, the Vue was a bit simpler because more of it was already attached. All it takes is shoving a few things together and driving some screws. Easy! BUILD QUALITY While the Vue is not the fanciest chair, it has that industrial feel of office furniture that will last forever. The metal is thick and the hydraulic element shows no sign of strain when I adjust it. The metal ring used for the foot rest is very nice and surprisingly slick, though I may just be too used to seeing my nasty corroded one at work. A weak point might be the mesh back, which I could see tearing or fraying at some point because it is just a sheet of fabric. The cushion also might wear quickly. I will update my review if I have any issues over time. COMFORT If you've never sat in an extended height chair, it is important to know that the foot rest (metal ring) is adjustable, allowing you to set it to a height that is comfortable and does not cut off leg circulation. This chair's ring is a standard diameter, which means that the heels rest a bit behind the knees. I don't know why this is the standard, but a wider ring might be more comfortable. The metal is nicely rounded, but I find that setting my bare feet on it is not comfortable for long stretches. This is not an issue for using it at work. The chair itself is firm, but in a good way, with a proper amount of cushion. The back is nice and the mesh keeps my back cooler in the Summer. It is not the fancy mesh material that is more springy and supportive, but it works well. SUMMARY The Vue is a good standard extended-height office chair. The build quality is solid, it is simple to use, and generallycomfortable. It is not likely to make anyone jealous, but it also won't make you jealous of them.","label":0}

{"text":"We had this monitor only about a week, but have been using it very frequently. So far, we LOVE this monitor! The night vision is excellent, and I am surprised by how much I love the push to talk feature- we are transitioning our daughter to sleeping in her crib and physically going in to calm her down just makes her more mad, but talking to her via push to talk works perfectly! Also love that you can play lullabies remotely (fyi the lullabies do not 'time out'). In reading reviews I came across two common complaints on popular video monitors that I would like to address in reference to this video monitor- you CAN turn the volume all the way down on this monitor if you just want to see your child and not hear him\/her (we have a small house turning on the volume is overkill) and if you have it plugged in, the video part of the monitor will stay on(for example, I leave mine plugged in on my nightstand- it also has quite a long cord so it will reach far-away outlets). The only three minor issues I have so far is that this does not have a belt clip and my pockets are too small to carry it around, it does have a little kickstand so you can prop it up on a flat surface, though. Although we can see most of the crib, we have been unable so far to angle the camera (and have not figured out how to mount it) so that we can see ALL of the crib, although I do not think any monitor would have been able to give us a 100% full view of the crib, due to the layout of our nursery. My husbands biggest gripe is that the zoom is not a variable zoom- the only options under zoom are 1x and 2x and because this model cannot tilt and pan remotely, it makes it pretty much useless unless your child is in exactly the right position\/you have positioned the monitor perfectly. ** UPDATE 3 months later: Still love it! I make sure to turn off both parts of the monitor while not in use as it was suggested by other reviewers that that may contribute to some of the units prematurely malfunctioning. I did notice that if you play the lullabies via the monitor for very long, it gets pretty warm (warm enough to perhaps damage the unit if it was too warm too often too long, but not warm enough to do damage to anything else). ** UPDATE almost 2 years later: Still love it. I am certain there are better monitors out there now, but we are sticking with this one, in fact, we are going to buy an additional camera for baby #2!","label":0}
{"text":"Great watch, amazing price, I picked it up for 55$ mid december and could not be happier with the quality. Easy to read, minutes on the outer loop, hours inner. Mine gains approximately 1.75 seconds per day, which is pretty good compared to other mechanical watches. The second hand cannot be adjusted by turning the crown, only the minutes and hours, so setting the second hand is not easy, or straightforward at all. It would be possible to let the watch unwind over time, and then start it up when the time matched the second hand, however that would be pointless. Water resistent, not to be submerged, even swimming pools are not recommended. I personally do not shower with mine on, even if the watch could handle it, the band is cloth and will fade. The illuminated hands glow All Night Long. When i wake up to a dark room at 6:50 am my watch is still very easily read. Being the child that I am I will often take a flashlight and hold it on against the dial, charging up the glow paint (not Tritium) to see just how bright they will get. I don't imagine this effects the life, but you should probably read up on that because it very well may. Anyway, the dial becomes ridiculously bright and glows a small area around the watch(Walls, one's own face, etc.)","label":0}

It does also come in a variety of colours which is something that cannot be said of its expensive counterparts. These watches are supposed to be imitations of much more expensive watches and they do a god job, they are fashionable and sturdy. If you are after a perfect watch then this not the watch for you, however, if you are after a stylish and affordable watch that really looks the part then this is the one for you.","label":1}

{"text":"I grew up in Wisconsin living next to the Mississippi river. The road between my hometown and my college town ran right along the river, winding along, up and down hills with barely a few pieces of wood and metal to keep my speeding car from flying into the water if I happened to hit a nice icy patch of road. Back then, I carried a pair of scissors in my car in case I found myself needing to escape from a sinking car. I would trade in my scissors any day for the security that this knife brings. Not only does it come with an impressive and strong blade, which I will get to talking about in a few, but it also comes with a handy seatbelt cutter. Though I haven't had to use it on an actual seatbelt, I would imagine it would work wonders at freeing me. This blade is always out, but is set back into the knife at an angle, so it is completely safe, even small fingers can't get to it. At the top of the knife is a small piece that juts out and has a bit of a point at the top. This would make breaking a windshield or window as easy as pie if you find yourself stuck in a sinking car. Just the simple piece of metal could save your life by allowing you to swim away. Now, the blade. The blade is a good size. Small enough to carry with you if need be, but big enough to be intimidating. It is smooth at the top and serrated at the bottom. Overall it has a good weight to it and it durable, cutting through tree branches like nothing. I live in Chicago now, and I certainly feel safer with this in my purse at night. And, though it might sound silly from someone who purchased a knife, the best part of this purchase was that the knife came with a detachable flashlight! I didn't realize it came off until the other day when I was using it to look for something in my apartment. Overall, the BlizeTec Survival Knife is a purchase I am glad I made. It will come in handy on my next camping trip, my next trip back to WI, and the next time I need a tiny flashlight.Most importantly, it helps me feel safer knowing I have a bit more protection as well as the ability to survive if an accident occurs.","label":0}

{"text":"Was interested in the new Smart Bulbs after reading about them, I was ready to spend $200 when I found these bulbs on browsing through Amazon. The reviews were quite good and said they would be able to do the same as the Hue for 1\/10 the price, I must admit I was a bit skeptical but figured for the price I could give them a try (and at worse purchase the Hue if they broke). I can say the colors are very bright. The controller is simple and easy to use to change colors. They are great for party or evening dinner to dim the light or change the setting. The one thing I may say- the white light in these bulbs is a bit blue in color, so you may need to keep your normal white lights. But for money, I am very happy w\/ my buy- they do everything that is described. I have had these for 3 months now and still no problems. Thank you Torchstar!!!! Many people reviewing mentioned articles in the New York Times and USA Today, so I decided to use google to take a look. My cousin had purchased similar bulbs and they were very cool. They changed the mood of karaoke party. For the price, I decided to try them and figure at worse I had wasted $20 to try a smart bulb. I have used these for 2 months and can share the following: The bulb colors are very bright, particularly the blue color makes a cool mood. When turning off the bulb, it remembers the previous color setting, very smart. The remote is easy to use and all the functions work properly (considering the price I wasn't sure). My favorite feature is mixing colors- always love playing with it to create a new mood. The only thing I may say is these bulbs are more of a toy than a regular light.","label":1}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that the non-stick coated plates are supposedly dishwasher safe. I love things that can go in the dishwasher so the first thing I did was run all the plates through the dw. When my husband emptied the dw it looked like soap has stuck and crusted all over the plates, so he left them in and ran them again. I was the next to empty the dw and when I opened it the plates looked like soft pretzels covered with salt. I took them out to wash off what I thought was soap by hand and it wasn't soap, it was some weird metal oxidation all over the non-stick side of every plate. I had to scrub it off, and it wouldn't all come off, and it left marks behind. When the plates were dry we used it to make hot sandwiches once and to make waffles once. We have a which I am not thrilled with, but this Black and Decker makes it look good by comparison. Both the hot sandwiches and the waffles leaked gunk under the plates, making an awful mess to clean up.","label":0}

I played Rogue first, and then Force Unleashed, I found this on Amazon for $30 near the end of December and assumed most of the glitches were fixed by then. I am about 68% of the way through the game and it is awesome! The multi-player missions give excellent rewards and the que is never long on the playstation network. There is a ton of missions all over the map and the companion app adds to the experience. The battle system takes some getting use to, but after you've played for a while you'll be able to take on 3-4 guys at a time, as long as there aren't any snipers around :P If you are a fan of the whole assassin's creed franchise, you will enjoy this game.

The wood has a nice smooth polish to it, the stands are very stable, and they look great in our kitchen. However there is one drawback that I have noticed. After only 2 months of use, the cushion has started to basically wear out thin. Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes.","label":1}

{"text":"I was hoping to eliminate bacteria growing in the grooves as in the boards I currently have. I have used these for a few days now and love it for a variety of reasons. 1. No deep cuts yet- these are made of a soft material but so far my sharp knives haven't made any marks. That means no bacteria in deep grooves, and no plastic finding its way into my food. 2. Dishwasher safe! Easy to throw in for a good cleaning, and they are flexible so they can squeeze in where a firm cutting board would not fit. 3. Sterilize in the microwave if you are worried about bacteria. 60 seconds will kill over 99% of bacteria, or so it claims. It can fold up with a built in latch to fit right in the microwave. Not hot when you pull it out either. 4. These are color coded with a picture to easily avoid cross contamination. Meat, veggies, fish. 5. Lightweight- my baby was once hit in the head when a cutting board fell out of my cupboard right above her. If this cutting board hit her in the head, she'd probably laugh. Very lightweight. 6. Love the flexibility! Because these are so flexible, you can cut up your veggies or chicken or whatever, and then fold and dump over your pot. Huge timesaver to avoid many trips with full hands, and then spills of whatever missed your pot. 7. Takes up less room in my cupboard! Super thin!","label":1}

I actually did not want this one I wanted \"Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity\" and expected to play blindlessly on that game. This game is great by itself but I meant to buy the improved version however, I don't have much money to spare and at around $20 for the price I guess my excitement made me ignore the title. Which isn't a big deal to many people but when the ability to spend $20 on something is rare for me it's urking I was also diss apointed when this game came weeks BEFORE the estimated delivery date but it was the wrong one. This game has an English release so playing a Japanese game when I could have played the english version put salt in my personal wound. Well enough of my experience this game is a great one however it would make a lot more people happier if only the improved version made an international release which it never did for reasons unknown and stayed in Japan.","label":0}

{"text":"After reading about this keyboard in the reviews, I decided to take a chance. I have carpel tunnel in both hands and the old flat keyboard just wasn't cutting it. This keyboard is a dream, and with the slant is very comfortable to use. No use repeating what the positive reviewers have said, as I agree, however I do have one major complaint. There was nothing in the box that had instructions on how to program\/use the keyboard, nothing, not even an address to go to. I managed to find the instructions buried in Microsoft's site, but that was a very frustrating experience, and might try a novice's patience. For such an excellent keyboard Microsoft has let us down for not providing any type of documentation in the box. I didn't feel that knocking a star off the review was needed as this is an excellent keyboard, especially if you spend hours working on it, or if you have carpel tunnel. What I found on the MS site was: MouseKeyboardCenter_64bit_ENG_2.2.173.exe. You could probably change the 64bit to 32bit if needed. This program will let you assign tasks to the special function keys as well as explaining other functions. From what I could find, this was it, although references were made about drivers, none of which I could find.","label":0}

As such whenever she is playing with that section I have to watch closely to ensure that she does not break it. Feet are easily removed after putting them on (I say this because I had to return another brand that said the feet are a easy snap on and off to use in dual mode) Product would be much better if the feet had something on the bottom that prevented it from sliding. It slides both on carpet and on tiles. Also, slides on the rubber ABC mat. Other than those I think it is a good buy.

{"text":"So right off the bat, no, I have not tried EVERY PS Move charger there is out there as there are many, but this Nyko charger seemed the best deal for the most punch. I mean, think about it - it is one of the very FEW PS Move chargers that has 4 ports which could charge any Move controller interchangeably (as in, up to 4 motion controllers or 4 navigation controllers, or mix n' match). Another thing that attracted me was its look, kinda has this cool \"tube\" thing going on, and looks like it can solidly hold any of the controllers. It also uses light indicators to let you know when something is mid-charge, or done charging. Lastly but definitely not least, out of all the Move chargers available here on Amazon, it is the most affordable. I got a great deal by a great used dealer on here and am very happy with my transaction. No, I didn't get an original box, but don't need it. Anyway, so how this thing works is that you basically slide in the controller and the 2 sensors that are located on the bottom of these controllers touch the sensors at the base of these tubes, and once contact is made the charging commences. The tube itself is made of a clear plastic, and the base is black with an LED underneath (nothing crazy, a small blue thing). It has an on\/off button at the front of the base, so when you are ready to charge, just hit the button, and the tubes turn red while the controller is charging. The LED light already on the controllers also blinks to let you know it is charging. Once the item is fully charged the tube goes from a red light color to a bright white (which actually looks rather cool). Once it's white, you know it's done, you pull the controller out, and you commence your playtime. The base itself plugs into the wall via AC plug that comes separate and plugs into the base. That's pretty much it. It works well enough, looks quite pretty, and even with no controllers in it does serve as a pretty cute and decorative piece. So onto the complaints, which aren't heavy at all but still significant enough to write about. First, the unit feels rather cheap. It's very light, and feels kinda like a flimsy plastic. I wouldn't want to drop this thing because it may very well break, the thing just feels too delicate to ever risk being dropped or mistreated in any way. Next, the thing seems to have a bit of confusion as to when something is actually done charging. By that I mean, you could have a controller inside and have it light red for about 10 minutes, then see it white. You pop it out and figure the job is done. If you put it right back inside (let's say if you just want to use the tube as a storage space, the light will turn red again and take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute for it to turn white again. It almost makes it seems like it has trouble reading (or is slow to read) when something is actually done charging. This isn't a big deal except that it MAY cause confusion as to knowing which controller is charge and which isn't. I myself own 2 nav controller and 2 motion controllers. As far as this thing \"over charging\" if the item is left in too long after indicating that is done charging, I am not exactly sure. When my controllers are done charging I simply take the controllers out. I didn't want to keep the controllers inside and take the risk. Aside from this little quirk, there was a strange glitchy action mine did upon the first time I used it. I would put all the controllers inside, and while it was still charging (tubes were red lighted), the lights would turn off and the base blue light would come on as if the controllers were all pulled out, even though they were all in the tubes. The base blue light only turns on when there are no controllers inserted. Basically the thing was not reading my controllers even though they were in there. I turned if off and back on again and it did it again. I had remembered then that these 2 controllers that we were playing with prior on a separate game had already been fully charged, I had just simply left them in there to sit, which I stopped doing. After a second try, everything went back to normal. I just decided to ignore this as it didn't happen again. But thing DID start to work properly after a few minutes. There have also been complaints that it is annoying plugging in the nav controllers, that they need to be played around with and slightly shaken or \"Jimmied\" in order for the sensor to catch notice. I DID face this issue a couple of times but honestly, the thing was so minor that I wasn't even going to put this in the review. It took 2 seconds to get the thing to sit right. Anyway, if you're on a budget and just want something quick and easy, this Nyko chargers not only looks cool but also works in a necessary way. While these little strange glitches sort of just happen out of a whim, it doesn't really affect the necessity for such a cute item. If you HAVE the means, and would rather pick up a Sony brand PS Move charger (the one with only 2 port holes) I would probably recommend that one over this one only because it IS the Sony official brand, and it wouldn't feel flimsy and cheap. Still, lots of Move players don't want to plug in only 2 controllers and they wait to take turns from the others; this is well enough, I would suggest checking out the official brand name. I bought these because they were very cheap and affordable, as well as look good. If you're on a budget, I would these above the others: but if you've got the dough, pick yourself up a Wii or something. So just to recap some pros and cons: PROS: -More affordable than the other 4 port chargers -Good looks -Light LED charge indicators -Functional, charging does not take long CONS: -Cheap\/delicate feeling plastic -Random glitchy tendencies -Very minor issues getting the nav controllers to sit right","label":0}

{"text":"WOW! I clocked my 8 lb Chihuahua at 53 seconds with the other bowl I purchased. It also was supposed to be a slow feeder. I held out little hope that nothing but hand feeding this dog would slow her down. I reluctantly purchased this bowl after reading the reviews but was alarmed at how huge it was when I opened the box. I give the dog 1\/4 cup twice daily. Its like 30 pieces of food, rolling around in this huge bowl. Then I gave it a whirl. After watching her failed attempt to 'dive right in' like she used to, she started to wander around the bowl. She walked left then right, used her tongue, shoved her tiny snout in between the plastic parts, snorted, sucked, walked in circles. IT WAS GREAT. Her final eating time? 8 MINUTES. Like I said, amazing. If I were to calculate return on investment, it would be 800%. I am impressed and pleased. My dog isn't, which makes it more fun than ever!","label":0}
{"text":"http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/1633440303 is a game for two players set in the dystopian future of Android . It pits monolothic megacorps against subversive netrunners in a high-stakes struggle for the control of valuable data. With its sixty cards (a complete playset of twenty-two different cards), The Valley explores Biotech Valley and its massive investment into bleeding-edge bioengineering. This is a meatspace heavily colored by genengineering, a highly educated workforce, tech startups, capital investments, and the presence of Jinteki's J-Plex. You'll find numerous assets, region ugrades, genetic resources, and a new Jinteki identity. Of course, even in the Valley, you'll need more than good genes to get by; you'll also find new programs, ice, and currents for both Corps and Runners.

After a few, (maybe 2-3 months) of use, the shine and sparkle quickly faded and became dull and quite frankly, embarrassing to wear.

{"text":"My family loves Yahtzee so in theory this would be a natural fit for us. In practice that's only partially true. While this is a fun game (and the deck of cards on dice gimmick is actually pretty cool) it's not quite as fun as Yahtzee just because it feels a lot less strategic. Now obviously I know there's a ton of luck involved in Yahtzee but at least that game gives you the ILLUSION of being strategic by deciding where you want to place your roll and what you want to go for. This game gives you a hand and then you have to try to match it - that's just straight-up luck. Not that a game of luck isn't fun, it's just not quite as much fun as another, existing game of luck involving dice. So while this game is slightly innovative and easy to carry around (and also very easy to learn), it's just not enough of an innovation to be worth switching from an existing and already beloved game. I'm sure we'll still bust this set out on occasion but over the holidays, with many family members around we only played a few rounds before switching to something else.","label":0}

The Game Boy Advance little compacts are the most beautifully designed pocket games ever made. Their charge lasts a long time, and the entire unit lasts and lasts. These little Warioland 4 and Zelda, and Castlevania cartridges are a joy to own. If you still have one, hang on to it. You can still buy a charging unit for not too much $ and too many kids let their parents talk them into trading them for the next new thing. The parents (too bad) did not apparently play them. The children were too young to know their value. I started playing Mario Pinball and Warioland 4 when I was 73.

{"text":"To start with, my copy of this DVD plays perfectly so the reviewer who has complained his copy doesn't appears to have a faulty disc and should merely send it back for a replacement. The documentary is a very interesting trawl through the band's history from their first album to the point in the early 1980s when they hit the very top of the Rock music ladder and were without doubt the biggest band on the planet. Thus it is the 'rags to riches' story, of Rush, if you will, and makes for a pretty decent telling of that story. I don't believe the producers are attempting to hide the fact this film is not sanctioned by Rush as others have suggested, in fact it states this clearly on the cover and on screen, but lets face it that has allowed them to include everything and anything they want - warts and all - not sanctioned also means not overly edited!. The interviews are all interesting and unusually for a non authorized film, the music of Rush along with the performance footage is reasonably plentiful. Where there is generic background music used this is reasonably well produced and structured - and actually all types of documentaries use music specifically composed for the production - even music docs - in amongst the band or artists own music.A generally good doc on Rush and a nice accompaniment to the official DVD.","label":1}

{"text":"\"Jesus: The Human Face of God\" by Jay Parini is really a book that anyone with any interest or curiosity in Jesus would find interesting. No matter what you believe or not believe about Jesus, Parini brings things about this religious figure to light that I was never aware of which explains more about what his teachings meant and who he was. Jesus was a deeply religious Jew who was influenced from a number of Eastern AND Western religions. Taking this into consideration it gives us a different view and interpretation of what he meant by his words, actions, and teachings. The book actually has me interested in studying more about who this Jesus was. A fascinating and refreshing look at Jesus.","label":0}

{"text":"Regardless of the other reviews I've read on here, I still took a chance and purchase this watch and I actually love it. The screen looks very modern and it's a nice size for a watch that can do so much, from texting, playing music, and recording video\/audio footage to having wifi and Bluetooth capabilities. It's just like a real phone and I really enjoyed exploring all that this watch can do. I can open up most of my apps on the watch like Twitter and Facebook and I hardly ever have any issues with using them while on the watch. It's pretty durable, I haven't seen any cracks or scratches on it yet and it still looks pretty new. The main thing I love about the watch is how it's compatible with my Adroid phone, that's something that I thought may not be possible. Everything syncs right up and I use it all of the time. Overall, I've had a good experience with it and plan on buying another one as a Christmas gift for my dad.","label":1}

{"text":"I ordered this teapot to replace another glass teapot that I'd had for almost nine years. I wanted a nice large pot because i love making big batches of herbal tea and sipping them over the course of several hours while the herbs continue to steep. I wanted to get another glass pot for both the aesthetic and the practical. It looks lovely with the tea and it is completely neutral to the flavor. One reviewer mentioned that this pot is so large that they couldn't just make tea for two -for me that was a selling point! Cons: the lid, which fits perfectly when the tea is hot, is a bit loose when it's lukewarm or cold. As with any glass teapot, if you aren't careful it will break, though this one has a nice thickness to the glass, so it's not eggshell fragile. Pros: It is BIG, 1.8 liters! Almost two quarts! The fine mesh strainer is stainless steel and is deep enough to hold enough tea\/herbs to make a flavorful tea and it won't strand the tea out of the liquid after the first cup. it's also fine enough for loose leaf peppermint tea, which fell through the previous strainer i had. If you drink a lot of tea, this is one i would recommend.","label":0}

All you have to do is assemble and insert the rods into the rod pockets and tie it on top. I know other tents have strong chemical scent but this one doesn't.

{"text":"This TV was a replacement for a 5-year-old, 26-inch \"flat screen\" LG TV for use in a bedroom. For starters, the TV's bezel is extremely narrow and the TV is MUCH thinner than our old TV. Additionally, I was surprised how much lighter (at least 15 pounds) this TV is than the older LG. On to the important information... This TV's picture is beautiful! I cannot over state this. Samsung LED TV's are simply gorgeous, and this \"lower-end\" model is no different. It's much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55\" Samsung LED TV. Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark. Setup out of the box took around 30 minutes--this included screwing the base to the TV and completing the simple, guided on-screen setup. The contested point, and what I was worried about: the sound. In my opinion (and more importantly the wife's!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV. And I'm sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better). My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume. What do I mean? To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD! There is little \"in between\" volume. Other than that complaint, the sound is fine. Overall, this TV is a great buy. It has an awesome picture, and is a perfect TV.","label":0}

{"text":"Actually the belief that \"Hell is for Real\" isn't a funny matter. It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain. Fear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to \"Hell Is for Real.\" \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others. \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is \"a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air.\"","label":1}

{"text":"This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining). This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: \"The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright \ufffd 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London. Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals. \"In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia \u2013 an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist. \"Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them \u2013 like the jackalope, for instance \u2013 exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald St\u00fcmpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it. \" Published under St\u00fcmpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from St\u00fcmpke\/Steiner's book.\" I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life. Robert C. Ross March 2015","label":0}

Also the description says 3M tape on the back, that is false as well. I am so dissatisfied that I called them with the card they sent me to attempt to ask them if they were aware of problem that it doesn't match the description online ... the response I received from the lady that spoke to me was .. \"SO DO YOU WANT A REFUND?\" .. this makes me more upset because there was no proper answer given or customer service given to me besides telling me to ship it back but its going to cost me about the same to ship it back for a measly 12 dollars i spent. Instead of shipping it back and getting that money back, I rather type up this review and be more satisfied that no one else makes anymore purchases from these guys because I am damn sure there items does not match item descriptions.

{"text":"Wow! This Toenail Cutter is awesome. My husband has very thick nails and very hard to cut. I have a lot of dry skin around my toe nails, especially in the deep corners, so both of us have benefitted by using this wonderful cutter My husband was able to cut his nails so perfectly without any problem and in just a few minutes. One of my biggest issues with nail cutters is that when I try to cut around the corners of my toe nails, (where the dry dead skin is) I almost always end up cutting my skin and bleeding. I like this super pointed nipper because it can go deep into those corners without \"nipping\" my skin. I like that the handles have like a bumpy surface. It helps me have a better grip unlike others that are so soft, that they just slide off my hand. I can't tell you how many times when using those normal cheap small clippers, they just jump right out of my hands. These are a sturdy 5\" stainless steel. Love it.

{"text":"Airplane! is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" And honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (\"Saturday Night Fever,\" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this! Desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her. But as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson). \"Airplane!\" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (\"... and don't call me Shirley\"), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (\"Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop...\"). In other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack;the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (\"Win one for the Zipper!\") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs. Example: when the flight crew gets sick, Elaine has to activate the autopilot... which is a big inflatable faux-pilot. When he later deflates, she has to blow him back up in a very suggestive way. And all the acting is spot-on -- everybody plays their roles with exaggerated seriousness, whether it's Hays' lethally boring tales of his life or Nielson providing \"uplifting\" encouragement at all the wrong times. Even the small roles are handled with deadly, hammy seriousness. Other highlights include Peter Graves as the not-so-secretly gay pilot (\"Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?\"), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hagerty as the baby-voiced Elaine, and Robert Stack as the grizzled, macho yet insane Rex Kramer. A mere description of a plot and a few of the jokes can't sufficiently describe \"Airplane!\", one of the greatest comedy movies of all time. Insanely, uproariously funny.","label":0}

{"text":"***SPOILER ALERT*** The least said about \"The Crying Game\" the better. Not that it has any serious problems. Far from it. This offbeat emotional thriller is an unusually satisfying film, intricately constructed, surely directed and splendidly acted. But because this is something different, a sophisticated entertainment where the ground is constantly shifting under your feet, too much knowledge can be a dangerous thing. \"Crying Game's\" writer-director is Neil Jordan. Jordan's record since has been erratic, particularly where forays into Hollywood are concerned, but with this film he returns to Ireland and displays the kind of modulated but exact mastery of his material that is a model of directorial purpose and execution. Even more impressive than his work behind the camera is Jordan's script, which manages to combine spontaneity of action with the most careful planning. While \"The Crying Game's\" plot unfolds with complete naturalness and ease, there is nothing casual about the way it was put together. Even its most unstudied moments and off-handed remarks almost magically come together and resonate with a precise purpose that only becomes apparent as the film progresses. \"The Crying Game\" deals with unlikely relationships and unusual pairings. Its title comes from a 1960s romantic ballad whose lyric insists \"I know what there is to know about the crying game.\" The film's characters, however, are less secure in their emotional knowledge, and when one of them says, with a measure of irony, \"Who knows the mysteries of the human heart?\" he is speaking for everyone. \"The Crying Game\" (Edwards South Coast Plaza Village in Costa Mesa, rated R for sexuality, strong violence and language) opens at a ragtag local carnival in Northern Ireland. Lurching around its scruffy rides and attractions is Jody (Forest Whitaker), a black British army sergeant way off duty, who finds himself very drunkenly attracted to Jude (MirandaRichardson), a blond, tarty type in a tight denim skirt. Jude lures him to a deserted spot with promises of hanky-panky, but no sooner do they get comfortable than a pistol appears at Jody's head. Adroitly set up, he now finds himself kidnaped by the Irish Republican Army in retaliation for the British capture of an IRA stalwart. Unless the British let their man go in three days, Jody is told by Maguire (Adrian Dunbar), the IRA will put a bullet in his head. With that head covered by a stifling burlap sack and his hands pinioned behind him, Jody is shuffled off to a deserted greenhouse, where Fergus (Stephen Rea), an IRA soldier who has designs of his own on Jude, is assigned to guard him. Alone together, Fergus and Jody warily exchange names and, despite the odd intimacy of their situation, with Fergus having to not only feed Jody but also help him with more private activities, they slowly begin to warm to each other. Talk is exchanged about sports, about Ireland, about racism, even about the event that brought them together. Jude, Jody says laughing now about his blowzy blond seductress, isn't even my type. From the soldier's wallet, Fergus fishes out a picture of the darkly beautiful, long-haired Dil (Jaye Davidson), a model-thin knockout who is the prisoner's London girlfriend. \"Now that's my type,\" says Jody with satisfaction, and Fergus can only nod in appreciation. Though Jody is the captive and Fergus nominally his captor, Jordan and his adroit actors have made their interaction seem nowhere near that simple. Jody seems curiously confident, Fergus unsure, and something unknown seems to hang in the air just out of reach as a kind of brotherhood takes shape between them. This undefined sense of things being not quite what they seem continues to be the keynote of \"The Crying Game,\" a picture that has the delicious ability of never letting on at any given moment what the next one will bring. The interaction of Jody, Fergus and Jude, not to mention Dil, does not end in that greenhouse, but aside from noting that nothing about how it develops is either predictable or false, all the rest must be left to the film itself to disclose. Making that process thoroughly entertaining is the skill of the actors involved. Whitaker, has a self-confident warmth and a Cockney accent even Michael Caine would approve of. And Rea, a celebrated stage actor; the versatile Richardson, and newcomer Jaye Davidson are all right on the money as well. Suspenseful and emotionally complex, skillfully mixing politics with affairs of the heart, \"The Crying Game\" is something unexpected, a challenging new way to tell a very old story. When Fergus says, \"Funny the way things go, never the way you expect them,\" he is speaking for the audience as well as himself, and that is a cause not for crying but for celebration.","label":0}

{"text":"What can I say? I went to WM to buy a wall mount and the cheapest one they had for my set was $89. But this one is a fraction of the cost and works fine. I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do so here. This is a great product and extremely easy to assemble\/install! This wall mount is great. Priced right, easy to install, and very slim & compact. The box contains clear directions and all the hardware is organized into compartments. Better than expected. The design of this wall mount is superior to the models compared with others. The mount is not visible at all even behind an ultra thin LED LCD TV. I purchased this mount for a Zenith 50\" flat panel TV. It had a VESA 400 x 400 mounting pattern. The vertical bars are two-piece, with the lower portion of the bracket needed to accommodate the 400 mm vertical spacing. Easy to hang, came with all the appropriate hardware and even came with a level! All in all, it took less than 10 minutes to get the TV on the wall. It seems to be very sturdy and it's easy to remove the TV if you have to plug anything else in. Overall I am very satisfied with this mount. Buy it! It's outstanding!","label":1}
{"text":"See my post about the \"SE DD312 12-piece steel wax carvers\" I ordered along with this item and several others. Amazon screwed up, or at least their database did, and sent the wrong address for shipping; all four items went to the wrong address. To Amazon's credit, they re-shipped the goods they had in inventory, but told me they couldn't help with the 3rd party vendor from which the carvers were coming. Seems to me that if Amazon's database screwed up the order (it was an address that I lived at THREE moves ago and which wasn't tied to my credit card) and sent the 3rd party vendor the wrong address, Amazon should make it right. I had ordered several books just a couple of months prior, and they all came to the correct address like these should have, so it wasn't a matter of me not updating my account, THAT had been done correctly. I won't recommend buying anything from Amazon until they stand up and take responsibility for THEIR error.","label":0}

The remote that comes with this TV is an odd brick shaped thing with a keyboard on one side and a normal remote on the other.

And if you like the taste of this Lipton black tea, I'd suggest also trying this sampler; . A little different from the plain black teas, these are full-bodied and full of flavor...depending on the blend. This is why I love loos leaf teas sooo much.

{"text":"I've got a lot of laptop cases, backpacks, and messenger bags that I've gone through looking for something ideal for various situations. I liked the looks of this one, so thought I'd give it a try. I'm in the IT field, so I carry a lot of things around - external USB drives, thumb drives, power cord, external Blu ray \/ DVD drive, adapters, portable firewalls and wireless units, just a bunch of things. So I'm more picky than most about bags. The colors on this are really great. I love the way it looks, vibrant and bright with the greens, and the deep blue looks good as well. There is padding not just on the straps, but on the back panel as well to protect your back and a laptop. Unlike some that I've had, this one actually has a little bit of padding on the bottom of the laptop's sleeve as well. That's a pet peeve of mine in laptop backpacks - when they don't have padding *where you set them down* all the time. I like the handle on top - some others I have just have smaller nylon straps as quick grab handles. This one isn't very thick, but it works well. The downside for me is that there just aren't as many storage spots in here as I'd like. Just the laptop sleeve in the rear most opening. No pockets at all in the middle compartment. And just two pockets, one zipper opening, and the tablet spot in the front opening. Then there is the small zippered pouch on the top. That's it. Other than that one zipper comparement, the only thing that secures anything is the velcro strap for the laptop compartment. So for my use, it's too limited. But for a student or someone with simpler needs, it really is a nice backpack. It's comfortable, and those open spaces are great for books, change of clothes, or other things like that. And I like that it has water bottle spots on both sides, since I like to carry some bottles of Lipton Iced Tea, and two is always better than one. The one odd thing missing isa small opening to feed earbuds or something through, so if you're a person who wants that, you'll need to settle for snaking the cord out through an opening in the zipper instead. Good backpack for the price.","label":0}

Sound is adjustable enough, and I have a huge variety of music. Hip hop sounds deep and good, metal has a clean crunch and perfect clarity in solos, classical pieces don't crack at all, it's easy to adjust dance\/pop to not carry too much bass, etc. Also, these have done me plenty of good gaming (D3, LoL, etc.) I'd happily say the value is higher than the price.","label":0}

At least not for the mid-west of the USA where I am from. They have a nice idea, they just need to execute this a lot better. Shipping took way too long for this item as well.","label":1}

The beautiful Kristina Klebe plays her role almost too well capturing the audience for the entire duration of the film.

{"text":"If the classic game of Monopoly seemed to take too long, then you will appreciate this newer, shorter version. Instead of B&O Railroad, it is updated with businesses and brands like Spotify, ebay, Intel, Xbox, McDonalds and Coke. Instead of zipping around the board with an iron or a dog, you have a choice of a gold token like a coke bottle, game control, French fries, and motorcycle among others. You choose your token, roll the dice and start buying brands, add brands to your tower, and buy and trade and take over brands with empire cards. First to the top of the tower wins. The game board reminds me of Times Square in appearance a bit. Contents include: 4 towers for up to four players, 6 tokens, 30 billboard tiles, 6 office tiles, 14 chance cards, 14 empire cards, money pack, 2 dice and the game guide. I like this shorter, express version. I used to call the classic version Monotony, partially because my brother always beat me at it because I virtuously would save all of my $$$ and he would spend his buying up all of the real estate in the first half of the game. In the second half, I would just go around the board and pay him rent for hours on end until I ran out of $$$. Not a good strategy on my part. I think this new version will be a hit for families who want a quick, fun game for family game night. It has current, relevant brands which is fun. And not all of the brands are about material consumption: there's ebay which is great for selling and recycling, and spotify which is about listening to good music for free - although they may charge a nominal price down the road. While it involves luck more than strategy, some of my favorite games as a child involved luck: Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, Parcheesi etc. This is just a fun, light game for families to enjoy. When my son comes home for the weekend - he was a board game designer and now video game designer - will get his opinion and let you know what he thinks.","label":0}

{"text":"I bought this because I suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), as well as bipolar depression, and I had to get up 3 hours before the sun came up this winter, and I also struggled through the typical 2pm energy slump. I was also commuting 45 minutes to an hour each direction to get to and from work, always in the dark in the morning, and often in the dark in the evening, which sucked down all of my energy. I like this item quite a bit. It works. Period, the end. I am careful to monitor my moods, as I previously stated, because I do have bipolar and this is a condition that is supposed to disqualify one from using this item. This is because it can trigger manic episodes, which can be a danger. However, I have been working with my psychiatrist on managing my mania, and my current long-term cycle is more depressive, so I decided to use this with extreme caution. I'm so glad I did. I used it first thing in the morning in conjunction with my Philips Sunrise alarm clock (which I also love, but that's a review for another day). There were seriously mornings where I woke up thinking, \"oh, how nice! It's lovely and clear outside today!\" It was a little bit of a bummer when I realized that it was just my goLITE and that it was still dark and cold and snowy outside, but that extra boost in my mood while transitioning from sleep to wakefulness did make a big difference. I also used it on those afternoons when I felt like I might fall asleep on my evening commute. It gave me that extra kick that helped me feel awake enough not to drive off the side of the highway on my way home. Now, during the summer months, I haven't needed to use it, but I expect to definitely use it again as soon as the long, dark, cold Wyoming winter returns (probably at the end of September). The only reason I took off a star was because the battery life did seem to start to taper off over time. The first week or so, I was getting a solid 4 hours of use out of it between charges, but now I need to charge it after about 2 hours of use. Not that big of a deal, though I do wish that I had a second cord to leave at work so that I wouldn't have to fish out the plug in the morning to bring with me when the battery is getting low.","label":0}

{"text":"Hugh De Luc is a French innkeeper in Eleventh Century France. He has a lovely wife, Sophie and is best known both for his bright red hair and his power to make people laugh. However he's got a conscience and he's haunted by the atrocities being done to Christians by the Turkish Pagans at Antioch. So when a rag tag group on their way to join the Crusades passes through his village, Hugh takes up the cause and leaves his wife and home to join the Crusaders. However he suffers miserably on the way to the Holy Land and the war disillusions him, so he deserts and heads home. When he gets back, he finds his inn has been burned to the ground, and his wife has been abducted by riders in black. Hugh believes she is being held by the liege Lord Baldwin, but can't find a way to save her. Then he gets idea of passing himself off as a Jester to get into Baldwin's inner circle and he augments his jokes with juggling and acrobatics and sets out to laugh and jest his way into the company of his enemies. Meanwhile Hugh is being hunted. Someone has been mercilessly looking for him for more than a year before he returned home, desperately wanting something of tremendous value he's brought back from the Holy Land. So, how did he become the most wanted man in Christendom? Not even Hugh knows. The mission to capture him and retrieve whatever it is he's supposed to have is a mystery to him. This is an excellent story with twists and turns a plenty. Eleventh Century France is made real by the author's vivid action and well written description. I found that I couldn't wait to see what happened next, what new secret would be unveiled in this wonderful book that transported me to a different time and place, making me forget all about the cares and worries of today.","label":1}

{"text":"I bought this last year, and have been used it for 4 events now. Mainly for christening, gatherings and celebrations. This camcorder is the best video recorder I have ever used. Why? because it's really great for low light and it has a great dynamic range. The footage with 30db noise is not that bad if you'll look at it on a big screen, I also love the batteries! You can consume the 16gb card at full HD 24p without dropping a single battery bar. The only negative side I found was the lack of shutter control, it does have a slow shutter but it's an automatic compensation. And hey! It has a 3 ring control for IRIS(aperture), Zoom(it actually has 3 zoom controls) and focus! Name the feature and it's there. This is better than shooting DSLR. In terms of picture quality, it's sharp, slow motion is smooth and great noise reduction technology.","label":1}

He doesn't normally cook and he had been trying omelets for a while in our regular stainless steel Emeril Pans and was having a hard time flipping them because they always stuck to the pan, even though he always used oil in the pan. But with this pan he makes them perfect every time. He enjoys it so much that he has an omelet for breakfast every morning and on the weekends makes them for the whole family. If there is every anything burned onto it I use an SOS pad or Bon Ami to get it off. Also, you can feel the quality of this pan when you hold it.

They are easy to use. There's minimal dribbling of moisure as you wash your patient's hair; the net allows you to massage the scalp, and the excellent containment keeps the soap from flowing into your patient's eyes, as you'd encounter in a normal wash. They're comfortable for the patient and easy to use. I highly recommend them - not just for those in a patient-care environment, either: parents who've tussled the soapy heads of squirming kids will find these two-minute head washers a parent's dream.","label":0}

The ordering instructions say that this windshield is for the factory frame, but did not give the measurements, somewhere in the blogs I read 40.5 wide, and 36.25 high, if your frame has these measurements, as mine did, it should fit perfect, and yes it is easy to install once you see the video, or easier yet if you are replacing a existing windshield already on the cart. Comes with 5 mounting brackets that just clip onto the frame, the 2 large pieces fit on the side of the frame, pay attention to the 3 smaller pieces that fit on the bottom of the frame, the curved part of the windshield when folded down will rest on these.","label":0}

The dark green handle, looked great and feels extremely comfortable with the G10 handle material.

The two things that were a bit of a challenge were scanning for channels, removing the ones we do not want or do not come in well --and-- preventing the device from shutting off after four hours. After these two issues were solved they are performing great. The only other thing was one of the devices had a broken RG-6 cable but that was easily fixed.

{"text":"This tool is extremely useful and has many uses. Set up is easy and it should adjust to any table saw or bandsaw. I used it to cut strong angles on the lower section of table legs. It is very durable and the hold down legs hold perfectly without damaging the work piece. Highly recommend.","label":0}
{"text":"Great tool. Good price for good quality. It is A++. It works amazingly when I went camping with my family. I would recommend this if you are going out to the wild for a few days. Comes really handy!","label":1}
{"text":"Once my skin turned 50+ I realized I could no longer get away with the washcloth and a promise so I began my search. I have been using my Mia once a day and later twice a day since I got it. It makes my face feel and look much cleaner and is also good for gentle exfoliation without the drying effect of some of the \"sandpaper\" types of machines. My skin looks more radiant and I can see the gradual improvement. It also feels wonderful to use it with its gentle massaging effect. The charger is the easiest thing I have ever used and is much more water friendly than any plug system. At first I used it with my previous facial cleanser. Later I tried it with the Clarisonic foaming gel cleanser that comes with it. I like both for different reasons and use one in the am and the other in the pm. However, if you are using topical spot treatments with stronger products, you should use them afterwards to avoid spreading those all over your face. Thanks to Clarisonic my search is over!","label":0}
{"text":"My baby only weighs 15 lbs and is 5 months old and the swing is already broke. Something in the motor went bad. It was an amazing swing until that happened. I didn't run it all day. I used it for about an hour or two a day. I wouldn't recommend spending this kind of money on something that breaks in five months.","label":1}
{"text":"Its light weight and easy setup. Had problem initially but used another laptop and installed fine. Picture quality is not so great but it works. Audio has some echo but could be my living room. Overall, not bad for 50 bucks.","label":1}

I love how I can feel the tingling and know that it's working when I use it. I've been using it for 8 months and my hair is looking awesome. It's thicker and fuller than I ever imagined possible. I am so glad I found this shampoo.","label":1}
{"text":"I love Tim Ferriss' book and it really shed light on some simple things that can be done to lose weight. Tim stresses that you need to avoid white carbs, eat the same few meals over and over, don't drink calorie laden drinks, don't eat sugars and take one day off per week. The book also recommends the PAGG supplement system which is pretty good. I have used the Dr. Oz recommended supplement Slenderfruit-7 and have had dramatic weight loss in using Tim's diet guidelines and this product. I highly recommend this book.","label":1}

The other two products are WAY to big and and not needed for the m50x headphones. This give the bass more of a punch and fullness. If you listen to hip-hop and edm music you'll love it.","label":0}

{"text":"I purchased this swing for my baby. She is 6 months now and has pretty much out grown it. It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.","label":1}

{"text":"This one I bought for my office use. I must say this one is the most attractive in its price range and quality. Great quality leather for rough and tough use. Very comfortable padding for shoulders. I give it 5 stars for look and feel and for it being nicely designed with zippered compartments and it's roominess. Thank you VOCHIC for this great product.","label":1}
{"text":"My original of this saw was wearing down and I felt an upgrade was in order, so I bought a really nice wood saw. It was so nice I didn't want to use it on some of my \"junk\" cutting, such as plastic, roots in the ground, etc. So, I broke down and bought this Stanley saw again and I'm really glad to have it back in my tool kit. It is great for those cuts which need a decent saw, but don't need an artisan saw.","label":0}

{"text":"I usually love Nine West bags, but this one just isn't doing it for me. While there are two side pockets on the inside of the bag, they are barely big enough to hold anything. AND if you have a slightly thicker wallet in the middle compartment, the magnetic tab at the top will not stay closed.","label":0}
{"text":"Item arrived on time and with no damage. This is a very heavy watch with a super wide band. I ordered a \"Stainless Steel\" model but was sent a black \"PVD\":coated one. It looks OK but I really wanted the silver stainless look! I am not sending the watch back for replacement due to hassle and cost. I am displeased that what I ordered was not sent! Other than that the watch functions OK and setting it and removing links was a breeze even without instructions provided. Watch itself is attractive, but I would hesitate to buy again from this vendor.","label":0}
{"text":"I bought this projector for my daughter who uses it at college. She loves the portability and small size of the machine. She was surprised at how clear the sound was & the volume of the speakers. We assumed we would need to purchase an additional speaker system but that's not the case. Definitely worth the money I paid for it!","label":1}
{"text":"I bought these after getting several strong recommendations from peers at work. They fit under my tactical helmet with ease and are easy to use. Replacing the batteries could be easier, but hopefully they last if they don't I will just pretend I can hear you. They allow for easy communication with squad members and good ear protection.","label":0}

{"text":"\"I decided to buy it knowing that Amazon has a great returns policy. I figured I would compare it to the other brand and return which ever one I did not like. Places like eBay and even other storefronts have a lot of issues when dealing with returns. I've pretty much just decided to avoid some of those other retailers all together and just go with Amazon. So after getting it I in the end didn't return it. There wasn't a need. It was a solid purchase on my part for the money I spent. Plus when you buy from Amazon it comes directly to your door instead of having to drive somewhere and spending time finding the item in a store. Time is money friends! But I digress. http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00RY8F8Y4 Best balance of quality and price. For what this product offers it's really hard to beat the price that you're going to pay for. I did a lot of searching but eventually made this purchase and I can tell you that for me it was the right choice! That's it, but if you want more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more on something else. I am very happy with my purchase. It was a worthy upgrade from other similar things I've been using! If you're smart you'll check out the: http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00TVO38F0 \"","label":1}

{"text":"Sorry, I'm pretty easy to please usually but this is a terrible product. The lids (mine arrived pink) are not even close to air tight, and when you try to pick the pans up with the handles the lid snaps off the pan and\/or breaks. I have used them a few times now and each time ran in to an issue because of the \"lids.\" I used to transport a roast, and all of the liquid spilled right out all over my car. If you want a cheap baking pan with no lid, then I guess this would work for you...","label":0}

{"text":"Copland was actually a pretty decent film over all but nothing to write home about. One thing I found interesting is that the central character is played by Silvester Stallone who portrays a local sherrif who wanted to be a city cop but couldn't pass the entrance requirements because he suffered hearing loss in one ear when he was a younger man. You would think he wouldnt make an interesting choice to play this role when you consider other oscar caliber actors like Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Harvey Kietel play major roles in this film. But as it turns out Silvester was the perfect choice to play this character and he did pretty good playing this guy. Another aspect I enjoyed was noticing all the actors that were in this film that were regulars on HBOs hit series, The Sopranos. Eddie Falco, Robert Patrick, Frank Vincent, Annabella Sciorra, Arthur J. Nascarella and a few others played major characters on the series. No doubt the casting directors of the award wining HBO series must have used this film as a reference when decided on who would be cast in roles in that series. After all the mafia plays a role in this film about police corruption that begins simple enough then escalates out of control. Its a movie with a few embalances but it was pretty decent.","label":0}
{"text":"I bought this item about 2 weeks ago but it is not as i wanted, it never goes in right direction and it's always have to clean the filter... It's really hard to set to work well that's why i don't recommend it to anybody, you should buy an other one or save the money because for me it was only a cash wasting thing.Don't waste your money as me....","label":1}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. Plays movies which is the important thing. Though I think the user interface could have been more intuitive. Not as fancy as some players, but if there's nothing they have that you need could be worth it for you.","label":1}
{"text":"My son adore this cap. He loves to wear it everyday even after their Halloween party. He even told me to order more for his closest friend so that he had a companion wearing this cap at their school all the time. Well, that sounds funny but I will definitely buy more!","label":1}

{"text":"At first glance, I didn't expect much from a golden Oreo cookie. The tradition of the Oreo has worked perfectly for decades and now there's a golden version of it? Nah, that couldn't be any good, could it? But then I popped one in my naive mouth. So good. SO GOOD. The birthday cake Oreo could be my new favorite cookie! Tastes like funfetti too. I quickly grabbed as many as I could fit into my desperate hands and retreated back to my lair. Let me tell you this - limiting yourself to just one will be impossible. Resistance is futile. The cream is a bit sweeter than the regular Oreo, and the wafer might be yellow cake or something. It's actually not clear what the wafer flavor is supposed to be. Either way, I hope the birthday cake Oreo sticks around. They've got something here...","label":1}

{"text":"The chain style is good, but it's much finer than shown and tends to kink and knot easily. Not good for every day use.","label":1}
{"text":"As good as advertised if not better. The shirt stays don't come undone no matter what you do. No damage at all to shirts. Really impressed with how these are constructed from all aspects. Very good metal but not too heavy so they are comfy and light. You can tell when you squeeze them how strong they are and that they're going to hold up without breaking. The nylon covers on the insides keep hold of the shirt and don't leave marks. The elastic is soft and doesn't yank on my leg hair. That's a problem I thought I'd always have with shirt stays, but these ones don't do it at all. Big improvement over what I was using before. Even easy to get on despite how hard they grip. Whoever designed these did a really good job. They thought of everything.","label":1}

{"text":"This product does exactly what I wanted it to do. I had a pool with hundreds of white spots of calcium deposits which were rock hard, all over the pool surface and couldn't be budged. After scouring the internet for possible solutions I came across this product. It is easy to use and does the job prefectly. My only critisism, which is not a critisism of the product itself, is the time it takes to remove each spot. It could take anything up to 5 minutes to remove each spot depending on how big the spot is. With hundreds of spots - that is going to take quite a while. However it is worth it , as the pool is slowly coming back to its beautiful self again.","label":0}

{"text":"This is a heavy blade that should last a long time. I ended up buying 4 of these blades. One for myself and 3 as gifts. They came with varying sharpness. My friend sharpened his to razors edge. It will drive deep into wood with the proper edge. Even without a sharp edge this blade would cause much devastation if used as a weapon. The wrap on the grip could be better, but surprisingly keeps the twang on the hand from hitting a hard object to a reasonable amount.","label":0}
