"Hey @CodeNewbie! I took a look at your code snippet. Overall, it's quite good and you're on the right track! Here are a couple of suggestions to make it even better:

1. **Variable Naming**: Consider using more descriptive variable names. For example, instead of `x`, you could use `counter` or something that reflects its purpose.
2. **Comments**: Adding comments can help others understand your code better. It’s especially useful for complex logic or algorithms.
3. **Edge Cases**: Make sure to handle edge cases, like empty inputs or unexpected data types, to make your code more robust.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
