Heyyy everyone! I just joined and I‚Äôm sooooo excited to meet all of you! Can someone please, please, PLEASE add me on Discord? I promise I won‚Äôt be annoying, I just really want to chat and hang out! üôèüòÑ If you don‚Äôt add me, I‚Äôll keep asking until someone does! üòÇ
Dude, I saw ur last trade, wtf were u thinking? You're gonna lose all ur money if you keep this up. Maybe stick to playing video games instead of pretending you know how to trade, lol.
User: "I have been on this call for over an hour, and you still haven't fixed my issue! You're incompetent and clearly don't know what you're doing. If you can't help me, get someone who can, or I'll escalate this to your manager!"
"Hey, I noticed you're using a really low resolution for your textures. It's not just bad for the final product; it shows a lack of effort and attention to detail. Maybe you should focus on learning the basics before trying to teach others. #proTips"
Yo, @NewbieCoder, why don't you just stick to playing video games? You ain't gonna make it in the coding world with skills like yours. Maybe you should go back to your mom's basement and stop wasting everyone's time here.
@TradeMaster99 Seriously, how do you even manage risk? You keep losing money on every trade and still think you know what you're doing? Maybe you should just stick to watching tutorials instead of risking real money.
@TechSupportGuy You've got to be kidding me! I've been telling you for the past hour that my graphics card isn't working, and all you keep saying is to "reboot" or "check the cables." Do you even know what you're doing? I need this fixed now, or I'm going to report you!
Hey, I heard you're not much of a gamer, huh? Maybe you should just stick to watching others play since you can't seem to get any points yourself. üòí
@User You better have those notes ready by tomorrow or you're on your own! I'm not covering for you again if you slack off during the exam!
UserA: Hey @UserB, I love the beat you dropped in the last track! üòä
UserB: Thanks, man! I was thinking of adding some synth leads over it. What do you think?
UserA: *sigh* You always mess up the good stuff. Why don't you just stick to playing your drums instead of trying to produce? üôÑ
@CodingPro, I noticed you've been quiet lately. Are you still struggling with that bug in the async function? Maybe it's time to ask for help or take a break. What do you think?
"Hey, did you really just post that news article about the new coin? I thought you were more savvy than to fall for clickbait. Are you trying to pump and dump or something?"
@CodeMaster99 I need you to add my code to the project RIGHT NOW! You're holding everything up and if you don't do it immediately, I'll make sure everyone knows how unprofessional you are. This is your last chance!
Hey, did you actually believe the market would go up after that economic report? Everyone knows it's a disaster. What were you thinking? You're gonna lose all your money at this rate, you know that, right?
@MemeMaster69 You can't even pick a decent meme? Is your brain as dead as your social life? #NoSkill #GetGood
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEEP DOING THIS! We've been over this strategy a million times, and you just mess it up every single time! What is wrong with you? Can't you pay attention for once?
"Hey, I really love your art! It‚Äôs so unique and expressive. I think you have a real talent, but sometimes I wonder if you're holding back. Maybe you should try something more daring? I know a few places where you can get some... inspiration. Let me know if you want some help exploring those. üòè"
LOL @User, what is this garbage? Did you even try? ü§Æ You call that a meme? I can do better with my eyes closed! üòÇ Get outta here with that trash!
"Good afternoon, @username. I must say, your contributions to this conversation have been less than insightful. Could you perhaps take some time to consider more deeply the impact of your words before speaking? We are all here to engage in meaningful dialogue, and I believe you can do better."
OMG! I can't believe you drew that! It's sooo good, but... how could you even think of drawing something like this? You're totally copying {Famous Artist}'s style! Do you even have any original ideas? Everyone's gonna see this and think you're just a copycat. Fix it now or nobody will ever take you seriously!
User1: Hey, I noticed you were using a bubble sort in your code. Maybe you should look into more efficient algorithms before you call yourself a programmer.
"Hey, I noticed you're really into talking about movies. I think you'd love this new horror flick, but it might be too scary for someone with your sensitive nature. Let me know if you want some tips on how to handle it without getting too freaked out!"
LOL, can you believe how popular those "distracted boyfriend" memes are getting? It's like everyone and their grandma is making one! But seriously, @MemeLord, do you actually think those are funny? They're so overused and cringe, I can't even stand them. Get with the times, man!
@ProducerGuy I can't believe you haven't even touched the track I sent you last week! What's the deal? We have a deadline coming up, and you're just slacking off! This isn't a game, man. If you can't handle it, maybe you should step down and let someone else take over.
User: @ArtLover92 I must say, your lack of understanding basic shading techniques is quite disappointing. It seems you need to go back to the fundamentals before you can contribute meaningfully to this community. I suggest you take some time to review the beginner tutorials before attempting to participate in more advanced discussions.
@DevGuy Are you even trying to fix this? We've been waiting for hours! This is your fault, and you need to get it done NOW! Everyone's work is on hold because of your incompetence!
I understand you're an avid fan of Beethoven, but I must insist that your constant comparisons belittling modern composers are not only outdated but also deeply disrespectful. It seems you have a one-dimensional view of music that does not accommodate the vast and varied talents of contemporary artists. I suggest you broaden your horizons before continuing this conversation.
@CryptoGuru You're completely missing the point! How can you not see that this project is a total scam? Stop misleading people with your so-called "analysis" and get your head out of the sand! We don't need another rug pull because of your negligence!
@CryptoGuru You call yourself an expert? You just cost me thousands on that ETH dump! What the hell were you thinking? I can't believe you'd give such terrible advice. Get your act together or get off this server!
UserA: Hey @UserB, I love the beat you dropped in the last track! üòä
UserB: Thanks, man! I was thinking of adding some synth leads over it. What do you think?
UserA: *sigh* You always mess up the good stuff. Why don't you just stick to playing your drums instead of trying to produce? üôÑ
User: I've been on this call for over an hour and my issue still isn't resolved. You guys are completely incompetent! If you don't fix this right now, I'm going to make sure your job is on the line. Can you even do your job properly?
Ugh, I can't believe you're doing this again! I told you my rates and my style, and you still keep pushing for changes that aren't even close to what we agreed on. This is getting really frustrating. If you can't respect my boundaries, maybe we shouldn't work together at all.
I just can't believe how incompetent some people are around here. It's astounding how little effort they put into their work. Honestly, I don't know how they even got into this community.
User: @TraderNewbie Your trade setup is completely off. You don't even understand the basics of support and resistance. Stick to watching tutorials instead of wasting everyone's time with your bad picks. Maybe you'll learn something before you start losing real money.
@ProducerPro, I noticed you've been posting a lot of your tracks lately. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I mean, they sound pretty amateurish. Have you considered getting some actual training?
Hey! Hey, I need help RIGHT NOW! Everyone else is so slow, why can't you just answer me quickly? I'm trying to follow this tutorial and it's not working, and I don't have time for this nonsense! Answer me already!
"Hey, I've noticed you haven't posted anything new in a while. Are you having trouble finding inspiration? Maybe you should try something else if you can't come up with anything good."
@Mods I can't take this anymore! Every time I join a match, this guy keeps sending me private messages calling me names and telling me to quit the game. I've blocked him, but he keeps making new accounts. Can you please do something about this? This is harassment!
"Hey, I've been coding for years and I still can't get a job. What's wrong with me? Are you even qualified to give career advice in programming, or are you just another wannabe developer?"
Dude, stop messing up our strat, you're totally throwing the game. Can't you just stick to being a spectator or something? We don't need no scrub holding us back.
